Western Street entrance seems to have the most services catering to long distance traffic (fast food and gas stations.) This is an instance where an Albuquerque sign would be highly beneficial. Your best option may be going to the Pilot travel center on the far east side of town, although going here you will miss traffic coming from I27.\n\n'''UPDATE (05/09/2023)''' - As most construction has now finished, a great spot for catching a ride directly from Interstate 40 (yes, right on the freeway) is located at {{Coords|35.1873|-101.9425}}, roughly 3 miles west of Western Street). Directly behind the Hilton Garden Inn there are 2 old concrete slabs perfect for camping on should you arrive late in the afternoon. Near the Comfort Inn parking lot there's also a hand-pump / faucet which works, great for refilling water bottles or bath buckets. Look for the green well pump handle, no pumping needed. Free water just can't be turned down! There is a Target and the Westgate Mall is nearby. Closest convenience store is located about 1/2 mile south on Soncy Road (Loaf 'N Jug). As well there's a couple of corners adjacent to I-40 should you need food or road money.\n\nAmarillo is definitely lacking as far as public transit is concerned. After being dropped off at the Western Street onramp, it became apparent that there was no possibility of getting a ride there. Too congested and too much local traffic, and the onramp is NOT hitchhiker friendly. Best bet is to walk the 3 miles West to the coordinates above. As a bonus, there are 5 hotels which all serve free breakfast. Take the walk, get some cash, enjoy the A/C at the mall, rest and bathe, and grab a free breakfast on the way out of town. --Jsplts.\n\n=== East towards [[Oklahoma City]] ===\nThere is a Pilot travel center located just out of town on the east side. Even if you get kicked out of the Pilot itself, this ramp is an ideal spot.\n\n=== South towards [[Lubbock]] ===\nStand on the ramp at the intersection of I40 and I27. Catching the westbound I40 to southbound I27 traffic is preferable.\n\n=== North towards [[Kansas]] ===\nStand along the edge of the US287/87 right where US87 and US287 (equivalent to Fillmore Street and Buchanan Street, respectively) merge. The speed limit is still only 45 mph here and this will assure you snag all the northbound traffic (you will be just before the bridge that crosses 15th Avenue.\n\n[[Category:Texas]]\n{{IsIn|Texas}}"},

Please update if you have info.\nThere is an official liftplaats about 100 meters south of metro station ''Sloterdijk'' on ''Haarlemmerweg''. Here you will find a lot of traffic going straight to Haarlem, and possibly even cars going to Leiden, and further to Delft and Den Haag. Though, most cars going there will use the Ring A10 and then the A4 to Den Haag.\n\n=== North towards [[Alkmaar]], [[Zaandam]] ===\n====Option 1====\n{{Coords|52.3924|4.8450}}<br>\nThere is a bus stop on the on-ramp {{Anl|10}} ''Sloterdijk station''. Exit the station and go 200m east on ''Hatostraat'', 250m north on ''La Guardiaweg'' and 250m east on ''Basisweg'' and then cross over to the on-ramp.\n\n====Option 2====\n{{Coords|52.4009|4.8508}}<br>\nAnother ramp is a little way up the street from the last. Get there from the last by continuing further down ''Basisweg'' (which becomes ''Transformatorweg'' until ''Kabelweg''). Follow this north past s101 (''Nieuwe Hemweg''). The ramp is off of ''Vlothavenweg''.\n\n=== East towards [[Amersfoort]], [[Hengelo]], [[Osnabrück]], [[Hamburg]], [[Bremen]], [[Berlin]] ===\nIf you are hitching in the direction of Berlin or Hamburg, you might find the route-page from [[:Category:Route_Amsterdam_-_Berlin|Amsterdam to Berlin]] useful.\n\nIf you are hitching in the direction of Bremen, Hamburg or Copenhagen, you might find this route-page from [[:Category:Route_Amsterdam_-_Copenhagen|Amsterdam to Copenhagen]] useful.\n\n\n====Option 1, Liftplaats Gooiseweg====\n{{Coords|52.3484|4.9213}}<br>\n[[ File:Amsterdam liftplaats petrol station.png |thumb|The walking route from the former ''liftplaats'' location to the nearby petrol station.]]\n\nThere is a ''liftplaats'', a spot specifically for hitchhiking, at the ''Gooiseweg'' next to the ''Prins Bernhardplein'' situated before NS Station ''Amsterdam Amstel'' (pass the bus stop). This road leads to the ramp of the S112 of the {{Anl|10}}, the motorway around Amsterdam (direction {{Anl|1}} and {{Anl|2}}. This is currently being turned into a third lane and is completely unusually for hitching a ride. \n\n====Option 2, BP petrol station====\n{{Coords|52.3473|4.9256}}<br>\nA little further on that road, which is called ''Gooiseweg'', and behind the bend you will find a BP petrol-station where you can talk to drivers, often a better way for getting a ride. The petrol station is easily accessible from the backstreets, and it is very easy to hail a ride from the side of the road immediately after the petrol station.\n\nMost cars here will drive along the A1 towards Amersfoort, Hengelo and Germany. The first petrol-station is just 8 kilometres further, just after [[Muiden]]], a second petrol station and parkingspot, called ''De Slaag'' is located 37 kilometres from Amsterdam, right before [[Amersfoort]].\n\n====Option 3, BP Honswijck petrol station in Muiden ====\n{{Coords|52.3209|5.0788}}<br>\nFirst you go by train, tram, metro or bus to the station ''Amsterdam Amstel''. From there three bus lines, 320, 322 and 327, are going to busstop P+R Terrein in [[Muiden]]. A presale ticket costs EUR 2,90 for all buses (GVB 1 uur ticket). In the bus you pay EUR 5 for bus lines 322 and 327 or EUR 4.20  for bus line 320 (numbers/ticket price may be outdated). \n\nStep out at P+R Terrein in Muiden, walk south ''Weesperweg'' for 200m, then turn left crossing the canal with the bridge ''Spieringburg''/''Mariahoeveweg'' for 200m, then 400m south along the ''Vecht'' canal eastbank on ''Lange Muiderweg''. Now comes the unverified part: walk 800 meter east behind the noise breaker along the motorway and you will be at A1 BP-service station Honswijck. \n* Comment: I tried this in 2018. Walking behind the noise breaker is a bit of an adventure - part of the terrain there is marshy, so you need to climb up to the concrete ridge on the back of the noise breaker and walk along it - but totally doable and once you're on the other side, you've got a good place to get a hitch. [[User:MatsumotoJoe|MatsumotoJoe]]\n\n[[File:IMGP0763.jpg|right|thumb|266px|Hitchhikers at the Prins Bernhardplein liftplaats]]\n\n====Option 4, [[Hengelo]]==== \nHush AVIA highway petrol station / rest stop (out of city by train)\n Train ticket to Hengelo is ±25 euro.\nThere is often a lot of competition at the ''liftplaats'' and drivers usually only go short distances, so by the time you have finally left Holland you will have had approx. 3–6 rides. You can easily avoid this by taking a train to [[Hengelo]]. From the train station ''Hengelo'' take bus 14 to ''Bruninkshoek''. You now find yourself on the street ''Oostelijke Esweg''. Walk in the direction the bus just came from towards the street ''Hasselerbaan'', then turn left. Walk down until you cross ''Oldenzaalsestraat''. Turn left and you will see a footbridge overlooking the A1. When you have crossed the bridge, don't turn right but walk through the grass and descend down. Turn left before the ditch and walk with the ditch on your right. Continue until you see a little forest; here you have to jump over a small ditch. Walk through the little forest and you will reach an Hush AVIA petrol station where nearly all cars go to Germany.\n\n=== South and Southeast towards [[Utrecht]], [[Breda]], [[Nijmegen]], [[Arnhem]], [[Düsseldorf]], [[Antwerpen]], [[Brussels]], [[Paris]] ===\nYou can either go and hitch from the same spot as for going West at the ''Amstel Station'', or hitch from where the motorway to Utrecht starts, which is called the ''Utrechtsebrug''. This second option definitely gives you more cars going into the right direction and generally a lot less waiting time.\n\n====Option 1a, Rijnstraat====\n{{Coords|52.3405|4.9072}}<br>\nHead to the ''Martin Luther King Park'' in ''Amsterdam Zuid'' where the motorway to A2-motorway starts, which leads to [[Utrecht]] and further to [[Den Bosch]], [[Eindhoven]] and [[Maastricht]]. Take tram 4 or 12 and walk from the ''Vrijheidslaan'' south through the ''Rijnstraat'' to the motorway A10 / A2. At the end of this road before the crossing, you'll find traffic lights where you can pro-actively ask drivers to drop you at the massive ''Haarrijn'' service station (see below). The best traffic lights to pick, as there are three sets here, is the one on your left side when you are standing facing the bridge.\n\n====Option 1b, Gas station {{Anl|2}}====\n{{Coords|52.3323|4.9122}}<br>\nJust 2km further than option 1a, but this one is only acceseble by car.<br>\nNOTE: Though the spot is generally awesome, you are likely to spend hours waiting for cars going as far as [http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verzorgingsplaats_Haarrijn Haarrijn] on Sundays (and probably Saturdays too). It might be reasonable to try further spots to avoid local traffic during the end of week.\n\n====Option 2, Utrecht on ramp====\n{{Coords|52.3369|4.8579}}<br>\nIf you are too lazy to go that far out of the city, take a bus or metro to the station ''Amstelveenseweg'' and stand on the on ramp there with a ''Utrecht'' sign. There is a wide shoulder and it doesn't usually take more than 10 minutes to get a lift. Once on the highway, hop from rest area to rest area and you wont have any problems arriving at your destination.\n\n====Option 3, Haarrijn rest stop====\n{{Coords|52.1437|5.0011}}<br>\nJust before [[Utrecht]], after exit 5 (''Breukelen'') and just some kilometres before the ''Utrecht Ring'' you find a big petrol-station called ''Haarrijn''. This is an excellent spot to find drivers for larger distances. Place is 2.5 km from [[Maarssen]] train stop.\n\n== Hitchhiking In ==\nComing from the south there is a petrol station just a couple of kilometres before Amsterdam. There are enough people stopping before going into the city. So get off there when your driver doesn't go where you need to be in Amsterdam and catch easily a ride that goes to the district you want to go - this will save you some bugs and 30-60 minutes getting to the other side of town.\n\n== Boats ==\nIt is very possible to hitchhiking a boat  around the Amsterdam canals. Just sit next to the water and thumb and eventually someone will stop. This is more aimed at sight seeing than getting somewhere specific, but more worth it than paying for the touristy ones.\n\n== Public transport ==\nPublic transport in Amsterdam is very expensive. Most people use a card called ''OV-Chipkaart'' which works with all public transportation in the country, but that you won't have if you don't live in the Netherlands. Thus if you just want to get across the city you're better off using a 1-hour ticket which costs a whopping €3.20. If you don't want to pay that much, here's a little guide to Amsterdam public transportation:\n* Trams are for the most part a no-go, since you have to climb in the front or in the middle, thus in the sightline of the driver/controller who will look if you're validating your ticket/card. Lines 5, 19 and 24 have newer trams, which don't have an office thingy in the middle like the older ones, so you can just board way in the back and you should be fine.\n* The metro is very easy to blackride: just go behind someone at the gates (preferably asking them first). Controllers are quite rare. The metro system is quite limited in its coverage but can easily get you to some main spots like Sloterdijk and Amstel Station.\n* If you're using the train, then use the exact same tactic as with the metro (though you might have more eyes on you...). The train sees more ticket control than the metro though it's still not very frequent, especially not on the Sprinter trains (the single-decker ones).\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n\n{{Cities Noord-Holland}}\n{{Cities Netherlands}}\n\n[[Category:E35]]\n[[Category:E19]]\n[[Category:E22]]\n[[Category:Route Amsterdam - Berlin]]\n[[Category:Route Amsterdam - Copenhagen]]\n[[Category:city's]]\n[[de:Amsterdam]]\n[[es:Amsterdam]]\n[[fr:Amsterdam]]\n[[tr:Amsterdam]]"},

Just before the river Rio Tamega, one of the two main rivers of Marco de Canaveses, you will have this ''gas station'' {{Coords|41.18695|-8.15549|1}}. You can easily walk to the gas station located in the Avenida dos Bombeiros Voluntarios do Marco, which is about 800 meters (10 min) from the city centre. From the town hall, you walk Northwest, for about 550m, from Rua de Sao Nicolau street towards Rio Tamega until you get a street on your left called Rua Cruz, the last street before you reach a small bridge passing over Avenida dos Bombeiros Voluntarios do Marco. Take Rua Cruz, walk for 200m and the gas station will be just on your right side when you will reach the main road Avenida dos Bombeiros Voluntarios do Marco.

Tell drivers you are going to Porto through the A4. Many of the cars might be from locals, though many are also going direction Porto. If drivers are going to take the A11 towards Guimaraes, you can ask them leave you at the tolls (portagens) at the entrance of the motorways A4 and A11 (they start in the same place). You can try asking drivers directly when they stop to take the card from the machine. These tolls are located about 10 km from Marco de Canaveses (via the N211).\nThere is a service station on the A4 before Porto, in Aguas Santas.. \n\n==== Option 2: Crossroad near Repsol Gas Station ====\n\nThe location of this option is very close (about 1 km walking) to the location of option 1. See [https://www.openstreetmap.org/directions?engine=mapzen_foot&route=41.1867%2C-8.1552%3B41.1938%2C-8.1546#map=17/41.18914/-8.15181 here]. This serves as an alternative to option 1, and you can perfectly try both as they are so close. Make sure you hitchhike the road going to the left towards the river.\n\n=== South towards [[Aveiro]], [[Lisbon]], [[Algarve]] ===\n\nThe best way to go South is to go towards [[Porto]] (West) in a first instance, using the Repsol Gas Station mentioned earlier. \nWhen on the A4 towards Porto, you can be dropped at the gas station Estaçao de Serviço de Aguas Santas, 2 km before the merge with the A3. \nYou can try to find a lift to a service station south of Porto (Repsol gas station in Gaia, or further south on the A1, Estaçao de Serviço Antuã-Estarreja). Or look to be dropped by a metro station in Porto, and go to the Repsol gas station in Gaia, walking distance from Santo Ovidio metro station.

It is usually faster and simpler to go to the A4, like in the previous options, with the road N211. Just 1 or 2 kilometers further east on the A4 you have a big service station. Note that this highway is not a busy one, and you might need some patience (if you're going to Spain and France, this is a way less busy route than the border in Vilar Formoso, near Guarda). \n\n\n== Hitchhiking in ==\nThe best way to hitch in is using the motorway A4 if you are coming from West, South and East, and the A11 if you are coming from the North. They will merge at the same meeting point - the exit that leads to Marco de Canaveses which has tolls, located about [https://www.openstreetmap.org/directions?engine=osrm_car&route=41.2370%2C-8.2029%3B41.1853%2C-8.1490#map=13/41.2111/-8.1771 10 km from the town]. \nAs Marco is just is one of many towns around, it's likely that you won't find a direct ride, and have to ask drivers to get off to drop you at the tolls and get back to the highway.\nIf you are coming from Porto or from the East on the A4, take exit 14 and right after take exit 16 for N211 towards Marco de Canaveses. If you are coming from North using A11 take exit 16 for N211 towards Marco de Canaveses.\nYou shouldn't have much trouble finding a lift from the tolls, as most of the drivers will take the road to Marco de Canaveses, or will drive through it. \n\n== Camping ==\n\nIf you want to do wild camping in Marco de Canaveses you have plenty of space and places besides the ones recommended here where you won't be bothered by anybody. \n\nParque de Merendas de Montedeiras is a really nice park located about 8 km from the centre of the town but very easily acceded.

You will notice a good interstate, with an emergency line, where you get your rides very fast\n\n=== East/northeast towards [[Liège]], [[Eindhoven]] ===\n====Option 1====\n{{Coords|51.2157|4.4473}}<br>\nTram 10 or several buslines to \'\'Borgerhout Turnhoutsepoort\'\' hitchhike on bus station or walk northeast over the \'\'Turnhoutsebaan\'\' for only 250 meters, passing the railway tunnel and crossroads and hitch after the motorway sign, start of the A13/E313, on the bridge over the R1/E19. Later on this highway splits in two highways (A13/E313+A21/E34), so make sure you find a ride in the right direction. A sign could be very useful.\n\n\'\'Update from May 2023: The road marking on the bridge leading up to the highway changed and there is no way for cars to stop. (The space seen on the photo doesn\'t exist anymore. There is a concrete barrier now). We tried hitching out from the gas station on the western side of the big traffic light without success.\'\'\n\n====Option 2====\n{{Coords|51.2082|4.5477}}<br>\nTake bus 420 or 421 leaving from \'\'Borgerhout Sint-Erasmusziekenhuis\'\' to \'\'Ranst Kastanjelaan\'\' (takes about 20 min). From there walk 2 km north to the \'\'Opstapplaats Reizen Lauwers\'\' highway stop and gas station. It is a big gas station on the E313 with many cars stopping. Finding a hitch here is easy.\n\n=== North towards [[Amsterdam]] ===\n{{Coords|51.2444|4.4287}}<br>\nTake tram 6 direction \'\'Luchtbal\'\' and get of at \'\'Merksem Lambrechtshoeken\'\'. Follow the direction of the tram. You will notice McD. Just behind it, the highway to the Netherlands starts. The traffic is quite sparse but the cars go by slowly. There is plenty of space for you and a car to stop. There is a ring which goes to E19 highway.\n\nIf you are heading for Utrecht or Amsterdam, make sure your driver isn\'t going to [[Bergen op Zoom]]. \n\nThere is a massive service station \'\'Hazeldonk-Oost\'\'{{Coords|51.498627913287706|4.743835317152586|1}}, before Breda, on the Dutch-Belgian border, where it is easy to hitch-hike for example near the exit from the petrol-station. You just have to write a board, because the highway divides into two directions nearby.\n\n----\n\n=== !!! 2022/07 !!! ===\nThis entrance to the highway is closed off! An alternative place would be to take the tram to Q Easy petrol station in Schoten! This is one highway entrance further than the one in Merksem, definite plus side is that it\'s past where the highway splits into direction Utrecht/Amsterdam and Bergen-op-Zoom meaning you can\'t accidentally end up going to the latter :)\n\n\n=== Most directions ===\n[[File:Erga hitchhiking from Antwerpen to Paris.jpg|thumb|348px|right|Hitchhiking towards [[Paris]], on-ramp of the Luitenant Lippenslaan]]\n\n\nMotorway at the \'\'Luitenant Lippenslaan\'\' (a continuation of the \'\'Plantin en Moretuslei\'\'), the on-ramps there are good for heading to Gent, Paris, Brussels, the west of the Netherlands and possibly more directions.  Make sure to make a [[signs|sign]] as people can go many directions. Nearby metro stops include \'Draakplaats\' and \'De Roma\'.\n\n(January 2023 edit) Alternative for those who prefer starting at gas station - east and maybe west/to the UK.\n\nTake bus 420 (Herentals) or 421 from Berchem Station, to Ranst Kastanjelaan, and walk 2 km/2.4 km to the service station "Ranst". Note: I\'ve only tried this going east, no fence to climb! Uncertain about going west. It\'s very possible to get a ride very far from here, as a lot of people stop here. A sign is recommended since the highway splits.\n\nThe bus costs 2.50 €, and you can pay with card on the bus. Not cash unfortunately. You can only buy a ten trip ticket (17€ for 10 trips) at most places who sells ticket. The tickets work for an hour on all De Lijn transport, and works for three years apparently. It should be possible to buy a ticket online as well.\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n\n{{Cities Belgium}}\n\n[[Category:Antwerpen (province)| ]]\n[[Category:E17]]\n{{IsIn|Antwerpen (province)}}\n<p>'},

When travelling to Northern German cities like [[Bremen]], [[Hamburg]] or [[Berlin]], this would be the preferred route (using Dutch motorways A50 northbound and A1 eastbound). You can take a bus 91 toward Apeldoorn from Arnhem station here. It's a few 100 meters further up the road than the bus stop.\n\n[[User:Ostkreuz|Ostkreuz]] left from here on a trip to Berlin and caught a ride to an A1 service station after 15 minutes. He came across many people actually taking the A12 toward [[Utrecht]] from here.\n====Option 2====\n{{coords|51.9993|5.9171}}<br>\nSecondly, there is a bridge 300 meters down the road from the Moscowa busstop. There is some room for cars to stop, but they might see you too late. If you prefer using a sign, this is an OK spot. 'A50' or 'Apeldoorn' would be a usefull sign.\n\n=== East: {{Anl|12}} {{Ade|3}} Ruhr Area [[Oberhausen]], [[Düsseldorf]]) and Southern [[Germany]] ===\n Be aware that sevice station Oudbroeken is closed to make place for the connection to the {{Anl|15}}. The parking may or may not be open, but either way it would be a bad place to get dropped of at.\n\n====Option 1====\n{{Coords|51.9788|5.9711}}<br>\nOne good option is a petrol station on the ''IJsseloordweg'' {{Nnl|325}}, in the south-east of town. From the city centre the walk can be long, but bus number 5 will take you close. Walking there is impossible, but getting a lift for the last bit was easy for user Soccie.) The traffic there is busy, and much of it will be going directly to Germany via the A12. It is also possible to stand at the entrance to the station with a sign to get people to turn into the station.\n\n\n====Option 2====\n{{Coords|52.0037|5.9224}}<br>\nThe Total petrol station on the north side of the city (see above) on the ''Apeldoornseweg'' is also usefull for heading toward the {{Anl|12}}.\n\n====Option 3====\n{{Coords|51.9844|5.9789}}<br>\nThere is a petrol station in the south of [[Velp]], 100 metres away from the ''Velperbroek'' roundabout (the junction of the A12 and A348 motorways).\n\n=== South: {{Anl|325}} {{Anl|15}} {{Anl|50}} ([[Nijmegen]], [[Eindhoven]], [[Rotterdam]]) ===\nBe sure to study the routes of motorways in the Arnhem-Nijmegen area before you leave as they can be tricky to navigate when hitching. There are many intersections and not that many service stations in this region. If you're headed to Eindhoven or Rotterdam, you'll have to go toward [[Nijmegen]] first. \n\n====Option 1====\n{{Coords|51.9688|5.8905}}<br>\nA good starting point is a BP petrol station on the Eldenseweg (on the south bank of the Rhine river). This station is a few turns away from the minor motorway {{Anl|325}} toward Nijmegen. Use this station as a stepping stone to get to the A325. Not many people will be headed further away than Nijmegen. To get to the BP service area from the Arnhem railway station, take trolley 7 toward Rijkerswoerd or buses 31 (Weezenhof) or 36 (Heteren) and get out at 'Transferium'. Turn back the way the bus came and cross the big intersection, but watch out, as there are no pedestrian crossings here. Be advised that bus stop 'Fonteinstraat' is actually closer to the BP pump, but is seperated from the buslane by a busy road with a guardrail in the middle.\n\n====Option 2 ====\n{{Coords|51.9315|5.8765}}<br>\nA few kilometers down the A325 you will find a Shell station called ''Kempke'' where more long distance drivers make a stop. You will have to hitch here from the above mentioned station, as it is nearly impossible to get here any other way.\nFrom ''Kempke'' you should only accept rides that take you past the many intersections in this area. For direction Rotterdam that should be service station ''Varakker'' on the {{Anl|15}}.

From the city centre, walk in western direction along the canal. After about 30 minutes, you\'ll have the northbound on-ramp on your right. For southbound, cross under the highway and turn right until you hit the roundabout. You can also take bus 114/115 from Assen station/city centre and get out at bus stop Balkendwarsweg for direction Zwolle or Balkenweg for direction Groningen.\n\n====Option 2, onramp 34====\n{{Coords|53.0283|6.5755}}<br>\nFor direction Groningen, you can also use on-ramp 34 \'\'Assen-Noord\'\', especially when coming from the northern parts of Assen.

From there walk north along the road (although signs for Astara will point you other way, but do not mind - they are stupid to navigate the traffic in a strange way) for a kilometer until you hit a big crossing. You can hitchhike on a junction to M3 where there is plenty of space to stop. If you are hitchhiking to Ganja it is better to use this M3 and then M2 instead of M4. If I am not mistaken, bus number 3 or 33 was going near Kempinsky from the center. Ask around to make sure!\n\n\'\'\'Option 2\'\'\'\n\nFrom the center neer Nizami Park, take the bus 31 at Sabunchu bus stop to Dövlat İmtahan Mərkəzi. Change for bus number 206 (couldn\'t get in it was packed so I walked) to the car market called Mashin Bazaar. From there keep walking to the the M3 for some 10 minutes. There\'s plenty of space for cars to stop. Got a ride in a minute.\n\n\'\'\'Option 3\'\'\'\n\nTake the bus 125 from bus station "Puppet Theatre" close to the old town and Baku boulevard. Get in the west direction. It is 0,35 Manat (you pay when you enter the bus). It takes about 1 hour to the "Lokbatan circle" or a bit further is the "Bine Ticaret Merkezi" a big mall. From the mall you can go back to the round about and you can enter M3 to the south.

There is no schedule for this ferry and it is not sure if it can be [[hitchhiking|hitchhiked]], but it is supposed to depart Baku much more often than the Aktau ferry, perhaps every 3-4 days.\n\n=== To [[Kazakhstan]] ===\n\nThere is an irregular cargo ship which accepts passengers to Kazakhstan crossing the Caspian Sea. There is no real schedule for this ship, but it usually leaves Baku every 1-8 days. \n\nSomeone travelled in this ferry for free on the same date, so it is actually possible to hitchhike the trip. Still, it is not advisable unless you really haven\'t enough money to buy a ticket, because getting into the ship without one is an extremely difficult endeavor and, in case you are finally refused the entry, you will probably have to wait 10 days or more until the next ferry comes.\n\nIf you are determined to attempt to hitchhike the ship, there\'s also some advice that might help you to succeed. \nFirst of all, you should be aware that you will be asked for a ticket at three different places: the entrance of the port (by policeman), the entrance of the customs office (where you\'ll get the Azerbaijan passport stamps) and inside the ferry. Bribing could probably get you through the two first controls, but it is much easier to just befriend the policemen of the port in order to do so. After that, you will finally arrive at the ferry, which ought to be the hardest part of your adventure. If you declare that you have no ticket outright, you will be immediately kicked off the ship, so your best option is to stall with some excuse in order to attempt to speak directly with the captain, who\'s the only one who might take you aboard without a ticket. Once you\'ve managed to stay on board after departure, the rest of the trip should be easy, because it is unlikely that you would encounter any serious problems at the Kazakhstan border. Enjoy your ride!\n\n\n== Food ==\n\nThere\'s a mall called \'\'Park Bulvar\'\' on the waterfront. The food court has the probably best table-diving in all of the Caucasus. Don\'t hesitate to even pounce on the cleaning people if you see another barely touched pizza floating by on the way to the trash. \n\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n\n\n__NOTOC__\n\n[[Category:E60]]'},

The temple is on your right, you can recognise it by the Indians dressed in white that are hanging out on the square before it. Keep in mind that you should cover your head (also as a male) and also show your reverence by going into the room on your right and bowing to all the spiritual men and all the pictures of spiritual men in this room. When you leave it, you\'ll be rewarded with a sweet :-) afterwards just hang out in the main hall until somebody notices you; they\'ll know you\'re there for the food. After the meal you\'re expected to wash your dishes. In this temple, there\'s always people sleeping as well, so if you charm them they might let you crash with them for a couple of nights as well\nThere is also another Sikh temple which is on the edge of Chinatown, which serves free food from 8.30 a.m\nHead coverings are provided,  the only other rule is washing of hands before eating\n\n== Public Transportation ==\n\nBangkok has an extensive system of buses and metro lines (not to mention the countless taxis, mototaxis and tuk-tuks that plow the streets). The metro lines are pretty cheap if you\'re used to European standards, and at least the MRT can be blackridden. For every journey you buy a black plastic electronic coin that you hold against the entrance gate to open it for you and that you drop into the exit gate when you leave the system again. Note that the coin will notice if you travel for more stops than you paid for. Now for travelling free (a bit harder to do with a big backpack) you just slide yourself through the entrance/exit gates with another person. Ideally this will be somebody you know because you have to follow a person quite closely and unless it\'s rush hour the random Thai person unwittingly helping you might be freaked out by your sudden presence so closely behind them. The entrance gate will also notice when two people pass through it at once and will beep loudly, but if you just pretend nothing happened, you\'ll most likely be fine as according to actual experience :-) After all, you\'re a tourist and if anybody should stop you just talk to them confusedly in English. The exit gate doesn\'t make any special sounds when two people leave it at once.\n\nThere are SOME red buses throughout the city which are free. Before boarding a red bus, make sure you see the word \'free\' (ฟรี) written somewhere on the front of the bus (sometimes there is a blue circle with the word in white; other times it is at the end of a sentence). Just hop on and hop off wherever you please.

You can either ask your driver to let you out next to towns such as [[Rubí]] and [[Sant Cugat]] where you can go to Bracelona by train, or get out of the car at a rest area and wait for another ride to Barcelona. A train ticket generally cost you around €2,20 (Sant Cugat/Rubí)\n\n\nIf you get dropped on the coast road leading to Barcelona (11) it should be really easy to keep hitching through the towns and villages until the city. I did the last 60km on this road in 4 or 5 short lifts but never waited more than 2/3 mins, just hopped out of each car and thumbed the next one almost instantly wherever I was dropped.\n\n\nYou can also ask the driver to leave you at the junction by the university (\'\'Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona\'\').

Train will take you there in about 20 minutes. \n* Exit the train station to the left, through the second exit in the direction of the train. \n* Walk under the railways and pass through the station building. At the other side you will find yourself at a small shopping district with a one way street. Follow it to the right. \n* Pass the church, traffic lights, and cross the pedestrian bridge. Once over the bridge, turn left and follow the fenced in school playground around to the right. \n* You should now see the motorway above you and parking below the motorway. \n* Continue following the motorway until you see the road dip down and to the right under the railroad. Go under the bridge. \n* Up ahead and to your left you will see a very broken vertical turnstile and a sign saying "forbidden" (see a picture here: http://imgur.com/MLxJc29). Ignore the sign and follow the foot path to the right, to the service road along the motorway. ( Someone also marked the entrance with "Autostop ->" )\n* This service road goes right into the back of a Gasolinera Galp Montcada Norte petrol station .\n\nUpdate May 2024: turnstile does not exist anymore, but road is open. When you go further you see a construction site with workers, just pass by and you get to the petrol station. \n\nAlso you can get to the same petrol station by metro L11 till stop Torre Baró | Vallbona + 3 km walk next to river to to Montcada district and find a train stop \'\'Montcada i Reixac\'\'. Than follow directions as above.\n\n==== Option 2: AP-7 Motorway Service Station Bellaterra ====\n\nTake train [http://www.fgc.net/accesible/cat/viatjar/s2.htm S2] from \'\'Barcelona Plaça Catalunya\'\', direction Sabadell-Rambla, and get off at \'\'Bellaterra\'\'. (2 zones). Turn left out of the station and walk 1.6km along C/ de Bellaterra. After you have crossed over the motorway bridge, you will see a small road to the left. Walk ≈400 along this road (you will pass through a small tunnel) to the service station Parking Bellaterra / Cepsa fuel station. \n\nThere are not too many drivers going north so option 1 is probably much better.\n\nAs of 2021, the tunnel is no longer accesible, and you have to cross a very busy ramp to get to the gas station - yet another factor in favor of Option 1.\n\n==== Option 3: Barcelona Gran Via ====\n\nTake the metro L2 and get off at \'\'Monumental\'\'. From there, pass by the \'\'Plaça de Toros\'\' (Bullfight Arena) and start hitchhiking at the last traffic light by the \'\'Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes\'\'/\'\'Carrer Padilla\'\' before street corner where the road leads to the motorway C-31. When the light turns red, ask people if they\'re heading towards the motorway. If yes, ask them if they can take you to the first petrol station (\'\'"gasolinera"\'\'). [http://www.wikimapia.org/#y=41400908&x=2183522&z=17&l=3&m=h&v=2 Location Option3]<br/ >\nThis is a good option to start hitching from the city itself. It works pretty well if you know how to hitch from petrol lights, have a big sign or know some Spanish.\n\n==== Option 4: Petrol station Barcelona Beach ====\n{{Coords|41.3931|2.2042}}<br>\nTake bus H16 from \'\'Plaça Catalunya\'\' direction Fòrum and get off at \'\'Cementiri de l\'Est\'\'. Head towards the beach, cross over the highway bridge, and you will see McD and the Repsol petrol station on the left.\nThis is a good option to start hitching from near the beach itself in Barcelona. It works pretty well if you know some Spanish or even Catalan as you have to ask the drivers at the petrol station.\n\n==== Option 5: Port ====\n\nBarcelona has a huge Port where ferries from Morocco, the Balearic Islands and Italy arrive. There are many cars going further north or to France. If you stand with a sign next to the passenger terminal where the cars leave the port, you can hitch a long-distance lift. It may be useful to check the timetables first, but keep in mind that ferries can be easily delayed by some hours.\n\n\n=== South towards [[Valencia]], [[Alicante]] {{Aes|AP-7}} & West towards [[Zaragoza]], [[Madrid]] {{Aes|A2}} ===\n\n==== Option 1: AP-7 Motorway Service Station Porta de Barcelona (Castellbisbal) ====\n\nTake Renfe train R4 direction \'\'St.Vicenç de Calders\'\' from either \'\'Barcelona Sants\'\', \'\'Plaça Catalunya\'\' or \'\'Arc de Triomf\'\', to \'\'Castellbisbal\'\'.\n\nFrom the train station, go left and take the dirt road that leads out and cross under the railway tracks on your right. Walking on this road, you\'ll come across a surfaced road on your right, that will lead to a bigger road. When you reach this bigger road, you\'ll see a bridge on your right. Turn left here, and then immediately to the right, to a small street, at the end of which you can see a "stop" sign from the distance. Go straight until it turns into a dirt road, keep going on the dirt road until you reach the petrol station. There will be other roads left and right, ignore them. This whole walk from the station to the service station shouldn\'t take you much more than 30 minutes (besides, you can find signs on the last road that directly takes you to the service station, showing you that you\'re on the right way to the "área de servicio").\n\n=== South towards [[Tarragona]], [[Valencia]] {{Aes|C-32}} ===\n\nPetrol station on Granvia de l\'Hospitalet leading to motorway C-32\n\nTake metro L1 Red line to \'\'Bellvitge\'\' station. Turn right out of the station and walk south ≈300m along Rambla Marina to the Avenida De La. Turn right and walk west ≈200m to the Galp petrol station.\n\n\n=== North West towards [[Manresa]], [[Andorra]] {{Aes|C-16}} {{E|9}} ===\n\nTake Renfe train S2 train from \'\'Placa de Catalunya\'\' to \'\'Volpelleres\'\'. Get out on the left side(taking the direction of the train as reference) of the station. Walk straight out along Carrer Mare de Déu del Roser, going a bit uphill. Bear left at the end of the road and you will see a roundabout with a petrol station. At the roundabout, take the exit Carrer de Vallespir and walk ≈150m till you get to the roundabout junction with the C-16 motorway. Stand at the entrance slip-road direction Manresa.<br/ >\nProbably you will not find a ride to Andorra but from Manresa you can take the road in direction Berga. For us it worked out quite well.\n\n\n=== Hitchhiking ferry to [[Mallorca]], [[Menorca]], [[Ibiza]] ===\n\nPls add info\n\n\n== Barcelona Public Transport ==\n\nThe Barcelona public transport system consists of an underground metro, trams, area trains, and buses. Day passes are a little more than 5 euro, and cover the whole transport system, buses, trams, metro, and area trains (Rodalies and [http://www.fgc.net/eng/index.asp FGC]). Single passes are for the metro only, and cost eur 2.00. The best deal is the T-10, which is 10 rides for 11 eur (1.10 per ride). There is also a pink ticket for older Spanish people 10 rides for 4 eur, but dont show this ticket to gate guards/ticket inspectors. These tickets will also let you into the RENFE system, but you risk getting controlled if you go very far (more than 2 hours or so). \n\nThe entrances sometimes have turnstiles and sometimes have sliding electronic gates. It is possible to jump or slide underneath, or climb over the electronic gates. If you get caught your risk is 40-100 euro - if you\'re not able to talk your way out of it. Control happens sometimes at the exits of stations, very rarely on the trains. Walk out by stairs slowly and look forward for them\n\nOn the stations with electronic gates, the best options is to wait for somebody to pass through a gate with a ticket, and walk directly behind them. This way you can across the gate. Sometimes, if you don do it quickly enough, a short buzzing alarm might activate, but this is largely ignored.\n\n\n== Blackriding long distance trains==\nOn train station Barcelona Sants, where most of the long distances trains leave. You need to go threw a control similar like on airports. They check your ticket, they scan your luggage, you even need to put down jacket to go thre scanner. This makes it nearly impossible to get in long distance trains without ticket. The gates for short distance trains are separated so you can\'t just buy few euro ticket to village near by. To get to the platforms of long distanes trains you would need a ticket at least to Girona or Taragona or something. When you come blackriding TGV from france you need to go out from the platform and then you would need again to go threw the stupid control to get next train so it doesn\' t help you anyhow. At least leaving from the TGV is no problem as there are no gates on the exit.\n\n\n== Staying in Barcelona ==\n\n=== Free food and shower ===\n\nThere are free showers at beach with cold water. However, they are currently out of service due to the draught (2024). \n\nFood Parròquia de Sant Agusti (Carrer de l\'Arc de Sant Agustí, metro Liceu) healty food each day except thursday at 10:15. Come half hour earlier to pick up number. Expect poor and sketchy people here.\n\nFree hot shower and clothes Carrer de Marie Curie 22 (metro Lluckmajor ) or Av. Meridiana 197 (metro Navas)\n\n=== Hospitality exchange ===\n[[Accommodation#Hospitality exchange networks|Hospitality exchange networks]] have many members in Barcelona, however, you have to plan your stay well ahead since it is quite a popular destination. \n\n=== Sleeping in public areas ===\n\nOptions include sleeping on the beach, in parks, nearby hills, roofs of buildings and elsewhere. Note that parks in Barcelona close at night, and may not be that easy to get into one.\n\n\'\'\'Ciutadella park\'\'\' is closed at night, but may be accessed by the entrance facing the Arc de Triomf. The bars of the fence near the gate are wide enough to slip through if you\'re not very big.  You\'re unlikely to be disturbed during the night but the Police might wake you up after 8am and ask you to move on. Another user got inside and pitched a tent. It is safer if you are not alone. Lot of criminals and junkies also sleep there dont talk and dont trust anyone. Attach your bag to tree with rope when you sleep.\n\nSmall \'\'\'park just in front of the Cosmo Caixa Museum\'\'\' where you can easy use a tent. By public transport, you can get the L7 to the end \'\'Av. Tibidabo\'\', than walk 5 minutes direction top of the hill, turn on the \'\'Carrer d\'Isaac Newton\'\' just before the bridge on the left and continue. You will find this huge building, with a big submarine in front of it. When you have museum on your back, submarine on your right, there is some [http://goo.gl/maps/MxfX2 stairs] in front of you, between entrance of museum and submarine, you will see the main door of this park after few stairs, it might be close if its late, so you can go to the top of this stairs, than jump on the left side, go under the stairs to the other side, and there is the spot. 2 options: (1) near the bench, better for the ground, but you might be visible at the morning, and woke up by a guardian; (2) right after geting out from under the stairs, the ground is shitty, you might need good stake to setup your tent, mostly in windy time, from there, the guy who open the door at the morning, can\'t see you, and he don\'t go into the park at all, so you can sleep till late!\n\nTake the metro from "Placa de Catalunya" to Canyelles station, walk about 200 yards uphill from the station and find some nice \'\'\'hills\'\'\' to camp/sleep out/hang a hammock. You can meet wild boars\n\nTake a late train to the park in the North-West of Barcelona. For example, you can take the S2 to \'\'Sabadell\'\' (ticket zone 1) leaving from \'\'Plaça de Catalunya\'\' and getting off at \'\'Baixador de Vallvidrera\'\': there is a big park which is nearly like a forest, and you will find a very good and lonesome place to stay within 500 meters from the station. \n\n\'\'\'Parc de la Pau\'\'\' small and clean park next to the beatch (15 min from metro to station Besos Mar, next to Dechatlon shop, street Career de la Pau)... \n\n\'\'\'Mountains next to Camp De Futbol Canyelles\'\'\' (metro Valldaura and next to Institut Escola artístic Oriol Martorel, street Camí Antic de Sant Llàtzer)\n\n=== Sleeping in empty or occupied buildings and rooftops ===\nRoofs and similar structures are quite fine sleeping places. Sleeping in abandoned houses is recommendable although it is considered a crime, "trespassing" unless you have a banner with the squatting "N" hanging from a balcony, window etc. The cops are going to put this down and inform the landlord. If they do not want you to stay and if you have been there for less than a week they can evict you right away. So in case you want to stay somewhere for less than a week having a banner is most likely not worth the hassle... You can just stay in a squat that has already gone through the registration process. Most of those houses are in Barcelona.\n\n=== Thieves ===\n\nWhen staying on the beach in Barcelona, you may notice thieves. They walk around and observe people on the beach for hours before stealing anything. Even though they aren\'t usually hostile or confrontational, they can steal clothes off your back while you\'re asleep. The only sure way to keep your things safe is to bury it in the sand and sleep on top of it. Sleeping with your head on your bag is just not enough. These thieves are very professional, and they look for people sleeping rough not just on the beach but in the central districts too.\n\n=== Wild boars ===\n\nWild boars are abundant in Barcelona, there are hundreds of them. Stay away from the canes. this is where they live and sometimes they spend the night there. Don\'t take food to your place. on\'t provoke wild boars! They unafraid of humans. If something happens, back off slowly.  Wild boar usually don\'t attack unless they feel threatened. They will probably stay away from you but they will come to sniff your tent once you\'re inside... I did nothing and they went away...  It\'s best if you stay next to a tree that you can climb on if anything happens. If you see a mother and her cubs stay the fuck away.\n\n\n== Free internet ==\nFree wireless and Apple demo computers with limited internet access at Apple Store (Plaza Catalunya)\n\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n\n\n== Take care of your bag and money there are alot of brave and fast thieves around!!! ==\n\n\n[[Category:Spain]]\n[[Category:E15]]\n[[Category:E9]]\n[[Category:E90]]\n\n[[de:Barcelona]]\n[[es:Barcelona]]\n[[fr:Barcelone]]\n[[tr:Barselona]]\n{{IsIn|Catalonia}}'},
 'Bay Area': {'text': 'The \'\'\'{{FULLPAGENAME}}\'\'\' is an area in [[California]], containing [[San Francisco]], [[Oakland]], [[San Jose]] and other urban centres. It\'s fairly extended, with millions of inhabitants. There\'s a plethora of highways, and it\'s probably better to see the Area as one huge city, with "The City" (San Francisco) as its cultural centre.\n\n\n== Hitchhiking out ==\n=== Going North {{US-R|101}} ===\nFrom San Francisco, the best place to hitch in this direction is on approach to Golden Gate Bridge from Lombard Street. Just before it reaches the Presidio, it makes an angular turn toward the bridge, and a couple blocks down that angular street (at Richardson and Lyon) is a large rarely-used bus stop area which makes a perfect hitching spot.\n\nImmediately across the bridge is Marin County, which is mostly a rich suburban area where getting a ride is difficult, so if you\'re going up {{US-R|101}} it\'s best if you can get a ride from SF at least as far as Novato, and preferably beyond Santa Rosa. Between Novato and Petaluma is a stretch of non-freeway where you could hitch on the road, which is probably better than hitching on a ramp if you want a long ride north towards Humboldt/Oregon. (check the map for this spot) Alternately you can take Highway 1 from Marin County up the coast, but while very scenic this road has little traffic so be prepared for long waits.\n\n=== Going Northeast {{US-I|80}} ===\n====Option 1====\n{{Coords|37.9372|-122.3257}}<br>\nYou can take the BART to \'\'\'Richmond\'\'\' (about $4.50), get off, walk East, where there is the on ramp to the {{US-I|80}} East.\nWaiting time at this spot was half an hour for a straight ride to Sacramento, April 2016.\n\n====Option 2====\nYou can also take BART to \'\'\'Pleasant Hill\'\'\' (about $5.25), there is an onramp next to the BART station, but the best onramp to hitchhike at in this area is about a mile north at Monument Blvd. It has a nice stop light on the on ramp itself. A sign saying "Sacramento" or wherever you are going helps.\n\n====Option 3====\nThere is a tradition of [http://sfcasualcarpool.com/ "casual carpools"] (known elsewhere as "slugging") across the Bay Bridge (check that website for further info).  This is a good way to get out of the city along {{US-I|80}} if you\'re leaving in the afternoon, but less useful in the morning as it\'s mainly for commuters.  Some but not all drivers ask for a $1 contribution (still cheaper than BART).\n\nYou can try to follow {{US-I|80}} to get to {{US-I|5}} north, but if you\'re trying to go north you\'ll probably have an easier time on {{US-R|101}}, see above.\n\n=== Going South {{StateHighway|California|1}}, towards [[Santa Cruz]] and scenic route towards [[Los Angeles]]) ===\nIn San Francisco, go to 19th Avenue, which is also {{StateHighway|California|1}}. Find a good traffic light while walking South. You can even start in the Golden Gate Park. Along Great Highway (e.g. at the end of the L metro line) also works extremely well and may have less local traffic.  These are both very good options if you don\'t want to pay for a bus/BART.\n\nYou can also take SamTrans bus 110 for $2 from Daly City station (just south of the SF city line, reachable by BART or Muni bus) to Pacifica, and get off at Reina Del Mar and {{StateHighway|California|1}}. Much more low key than dealing with the city, if you have the spare cash.  Once you\'re out of the city and dealing with smaller town traffic (Pacifica and south), getting picked up is a piece of cake.\n\nContinuing beyond Santa Cruz towards Los Angeles along {{StateHighway|California|1}} will probably be slower than taking {{US-I|5}} but this is considered one of the most scenic roads in California.\n\nIf you\'re starting from closer to San Jose, you can also reach Santa Cruz by taking the VTA 68 bus from there south to Gilroy for $2 and hitchhiking out on 1st street, which is also {{StateHighway|California|152}} (west); this is a good hitching spot in the morning when people are headed from Gilroy to Santa Cruz to work.  Though at that rate the 17 bus from San Jose all the way to Santa Cruz is $5 and takes a much more direct route.\n\n\n=== Going South {{US-I|5}}, fast route towards [[Los Angeles]] or [[Las Vegas]]) ===\n====Option 1====\nTake the {{US-I|5}} if you want to get there fast. You might want to take the BART train to \'\'\'Dublin/Pleasanton\'\'\' (about $6). The BART station is located next to a freeway entrance which has a lot of traffic and a fairly decent spot to stop (after the \'freeway entrance\' sign). You might have better luck if you walk further east to the following entrance which has less traffic, but a big bus stop to pull into a couple hundred meters before the entrance itself.  You\'re actually hitching onto {{US-I|580}} here but it merges into {{US-I|5}} further out; avoid getting a ride to Tracy or Stockton if you want to go south, it won\'t do you much good. \n\n====Option 2====\nThis route worked really well for an anonymous user in 2009: Take Caltrain south to San Jose (about $9 from downtown SF, $7 from the BART transfer at Millbrae). Take VTA bus 68 to Gilroy from there, 1.5 hours, $2. Hitchhike east along the Pacheco Pass highway {{StateHighway|California|152}} east), which leads towards {{US-I|5}}; many cars here will be continuing south to Los Angeles on {{US-I|5}}.  If heading towards Las Vegas, get off {{US-I|5}} at exit 257, to get onto {{StateHighway|California|58}}. Take that East, avoid getting stuck in Bakersfield. 58 goes all the way through, past [[Mojave]] and [[Barstow]], towards [[Las Vegas]].\n\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n[[Category:California]]\n{{IsIn|California}}\n[[Category:City\'s]]'},

Many camels!]]\nA good place to start hitching east is the near (under) Negev Brigade interchange, which can be reached by walking three kilometers or so northeast on Derech Hevron out of the city center.\n\n=== North to [[Tel Aviv]] [[Jerusalem]] ===\nFrom the main bus station take the bus number 8 until the last stop. Then, when you get down the bus, walk a hundred meters in the opposite direction, until you reach the main avenue. There, turn left and walk another 100 meters. You can hitchhike there, direction north, after the light. There isn\'t any bus stop, but a lot of cars stop. With a sign with "Jerusalem" or "Tel Aviv" maybe it works better, but anyway its super easy.\n\n=== East to [[Arad (Israel)|Arad]], [[Dead Sea (Israel)|Dead Sea]] ===\n\nFrom Negev Brigade interchange, hitchhike east to the next major junction ("Shoket"), where road 60 meets road 31 west towards Tel Aviv or road 31 east towards Arad and the hotels area of the Dead Sea. Cars going directly onto highway 6 north won\'t help you to get to "Shoket" junction, there\'s no place to let you off and to walk to "Shoket" junction, unless they are willing to do an extra mile to "Shoket" junction, then they can take a left onto highway 31 west on back onto highway 6.\n\nOn "Shoket" junction hitch directly to the Dead Sea or to Arad (no point in taking a hitchhike to a beduoin camp along the way (there are plenty) - since most drivers won\'t stop near bedouin camps for onward journeys) (\'\'Google map for Shoket junction road 31 south hitch point\'\' {{Coords|31.3061093|34.9011684|1}}).\n\n=== South to [[Dimona]], [[Eilat]], Aqaba ([[Jordan]]), Taba ([[Egypt]]) ===\nYou can try to hitchhike southwards from the junction of Derekh Eilat (Eilat road inside Be\'er Sheva) and Tozeret Ha\'Aretz, this is the southern part of civilization before it\'s all desert. This should get you to Eilat via [[Mitzpe Ramon]] on highway 40.\n\nTo hitchhike to Eilat via Dimona (eastwards to highway 25 and then southwards to highway 90) - you can try hitchhiking from Yigal Alon blvd, just east of their junction with Derekh Eilat (Eilat road) (\'\'Google street view\'\' {{Coords|31.2303298|34.8029948|1}}). Another option is to get further under Sarah interchange (\'\'Google street view\'\' {{Coords|31.2249031|34.8298294|1}}).\nThe road passes through Dimona, meets up with road 90, gets southbound traffic from the Dead Sea (and from Jerusalem) at [[Ha\'Arava Junction]], and ends in [[Eilat]].\nNext to [[Eilat]] (a great destination by itself) are Jordanian and Egyptian border crossings.\n{{IsIn|Israel}}\n\n{{Cities Israel}}\n[[Category:Israel]]'},

The European route [[E30]] passes through it entering at [[Brest (Belarus)|Brest]] on the border with [[Poland]] and leaving at the [[Russia]]n border between [[Orša]] and [[Smolensk]]. It is a fantastic and easy-going place for hitchhiking and the police or the political system generally will not bother you at all, so once you have your visa (if needed) you can just relax and go for it. You will enjoy!\n\n== General information ==\n72% of the population live in towns and cities, and virtually all the population speaks Russian as their first language. In rural areas a mix of Russian and Belarusian may be spoken. It is therefore better to make destination [[signs]] in Russian when hitchhiking.\n\nAlso, there are two versions of the Belarusian flag – the official one is the red-green flag (also jokingly known as “dusk over a swamp”), whereas the one used by the opposition is a three-striped white-red-white flag. For your own safety, it is not advised to demonstrate the latter one in public.\n\nFreedom of speech is very restricted in Belarus, try not to ask too many questions about mr. Lukashenko, people might get in trouble when saying something bad about their politics.\n\n== Language ==\nIn big cities, especially Minsk, you can expect young people to speak at least a basic level of English. If you are hitch-hiking to Russia along [[E30]]/[[M1 (Belarus)|M1]], expect some truck drivers to speak Polish as well as Russian.\n\nLanguage barrier can cause some troubles since many drivers speak almost exclusively only Russian or \'\'Trasianka\'\', the mishmash of Belarusian and Russian, therefore learn some basic phrases in Russian before you go there. If you do understand some Russian but you are not familiar with Belarusian culture don\'t get scared or disappointed hearing many swearing words when drivers talk to you – these words aren\'t directed to you but are rather a simple hearty expression.\n\n== Hitchhiking ==\n\nHitchhiking in Belarus is very easy and rarely your waiting time will exceed 15 minutes, at least on the main road M1 from [[Brest]] via [[Minsk]] to [[Moscow]]. As it is very common in Belarus, often drivers may pick you up without being curious about you or what you are doing, sometimes no communication at all. Belarusian people can seem gloomy at first sight, but in the end they are mostly very nice and helpful and drop you on a good spot. In rare cases a small number of older drivers might ask for some money when giving you a ride – to avoid that, tell the driver about your intention to travel for free before you sit into the car (\'\'"Ja puteshestvuju avtostopom, bez deneg"\'\' [\'\'"u"\'\' is pronounced as \'\'"oo"\'\' in English] – \'\'"I travel by hitch-hiking, not paying any money"\'\'). Usually, just saying \'no money\' works just fine too. It might be more difficult if you are more than 2 persons travelling together – in such case it would be smart to split up for some time. \n\nWhen hitchhiking in Belarus, it is very likely to find some other people standing next to the road, waiting for a car to pick them up. Although most people do not speak English well, it is nice to try to make some contact. Most of them might look angry, but it\'s just on the outside and once you start talking to them they\'re just very friendly and warm people. Some Belarusians will even wait for an hour with you in a snowstorm, waiting for another car to stop :) \n\nRussian and Baltic truck drivers are reluctant to stop for hitchhikers in Belarus while Belarusian and Polish trucks are happy to have a company of some traveller(s). Hitchhiking at night is difficult but if you make yourself very visible you can get a ride even at two o\'clock at night (some cars might stop just because a driver thinks you are police – light reflectors might give such an impression).\n\nThe average waiting time is about 20 minutes. It’s better to travel using main roads as road traffic on local roads is pretty poor. In Belarus there are no roads with limitations for hitchhikers, you can start stopping a car wherever you like, the only exception is bridges. Roadsides are usually wide enough to stop even a truck. Main roads are in a good condition while roads in rural areas might unpleasantly surprise you. \n\n[[File:IMG 20170717 154059.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Light-returning reflectinve band. This little thing can save you about 10€ when you meet the policy at the road]]\n\n\'\'\'Note\'\'\': In Belarus you have to wear a flicker (light-returning element or reflective band) when you are on the road after sunset. The [[police]] have a plan to get some amount of violators each month, so the possibility of penalty (about € 10) is quite high. It\'s better to buy a flicker (it costs from € 1), and it\'s not a problem – now they are sold in any shop in Belarus. And it\'s [[hitchhiker\'s safety|a good idea]] to use them anyway when [[hitchhiking at night]].\n\n\n== Maps ==\n[[File:Ratmir_autostop_Minsk.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Ratmir]] hitching from [[Minsk]] to [[Polack]]]]\nThere are only about fifteen main roads in Belarus, so if you are not staying in Belarus for long you can hitch through having just a print from any Internet source (for example, this [http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/google_map_belarus.htm]). More detailed maps can be bought in any kiosk of "Bielsajuzdruk" ("Белсаюздрук"), where newspapers are sold.\n\n== Eating ==\nIn Belarus the road service is very poor, and restaurants in normal amount (for every 30-40 km) exists only on main roads, like [[E30]]/[[M1 (Belarus)|M1]]. But on the way there are usually a lot of small towns and villages, where in the shops you can find anything what you need (and 2-3 times cheaper than in a cafe). And of course, if you want to find some ready dishes, you can go to a students canteen or something like that.\n\n== Visa ==\nForeign citizens of 74 countries, who \'\'\'both enter\'\'\' and \'\'\'leave\'\'\' via Minsk International Airport, can enter Belarus for up to 30 days \'\'\'without visa\'\'\' (since July 27, 2018). This does not extend to persons coming to Belarus by plane from Russia, as well as to those who would fly out via Russia (such flights are considered as internal ones and do not have border control).\n\nNevertheless you have to fulfil several requirements to be able to enter the country without visa. For more information check web-pages of the Belorussian MFA and State Border Committee of the Republic of Belarus:\n\n[http://mfa.gov.by/en/visa/visafreetravel/e0ced19bb1f9bf2c.html \'\'Information on visa-free travel via the checkpoint "Minsk National Airport"\'\']<br>\n[https://gpk.gov.by/en/border-crossing/ \'\'Border crossing rules for foreign citizens\'\']\n\n[[File:Belarus_regional_visa-free_provisions_in_Grodno_and_Brest_regions.png|220px|thumb|right|Part of Belarus covered by Brest and Hrodna regional visa-free provision]]\nAdditionally, you can also enter some parts of the country overland without a visa for up to 15 days. In order to visit Brest and Hrodna regions for 15 days without visas you need to get visa-free travel documents at least 72 hours before your journey to Belarus.\n\nFor more details check the following link: [https://bezviz.by/en/ \'\'Belarus visa free\'\'].\n\nFor an old-fashioned visa, follow this procedure:\nTry to find someone on Couchsurfing/BeWelcome/TrustRoots who\'d be willing to "invite" you to Belarus (thus you could apply for a "private visit" visa), as this would save you money in the visa application process - the only way to get a regular tourist visa is through an overpriced agency, which would be eager to book hotels on your behalf. Some embassies may be satisfied with a confirmed hotel booking, without an agency letter, but that would be up to their discretion. However, most Belarusian embassies will issue a "private visit" visa without a letter of invitation or other supporting documents where only the personal info of the inviting person would suffice if the visa duration is less than 30 days. In some cases, they may however ask for a copy of the inviting person\'s passport but again that would be up to the discretion of the embassy personnel.\n\n\'\'[[user:uncle_sam01|uncle_sam01]] applied for a private visit visa at the embassy in Warsaw in July 2016 and was asked to provide a copy of the inviting person\'s passport. Other than that the process was a mere formality.\'\'\n\n== Registration ==\n\n\'\'\'UPDATE (2019): As from 2nd January 2019, foreigners can register online and for free. See [http://belarusfeed.com/belarus-allows-online-registration-tourists/] for more details on how to register online. Important caveat: online registration is NOT possible if you entered Belarus from Russia. In this case, you must register at a Department for Citizenship and Migration.\'\'\'\n\nThe old-fashioned way:\n\nWhen travelling to Belarus, you have to be registered with the authorities as a "temporary resident" if you stay in the country for longer than 5 business days (\'\'\'including Saturday!\'\'\'). Registration consists of a Soviet-style blue stamp on the back of your "Migration Card" (you\'ll get this at the border).How this is done will vary depending on where you stay:\n\n\'\'\'1. Hotels only\'\'\'\nEasiest option - they\'ll do it for you automatically and you won\'t have to worry about it. In some rare instances, they may charge extra for registration.\n\n\'\'\'2. Couchsurfing/squatting/camping\'\'\'\nYou\'ll have to visit the local "Migration Department" within 5 business days(\'\'\'including Saturday!\'\'\') \'\'\'with your as well as your host\'s passport\'\'\'(they don\'t have to be there in person, but if you don\'t speak Russian, it\'s best that they are). You\'ll fill out a form and pay a fee(around EUR 10). It might sound scary, but it\'s relatively straightforward. You should register with your first host upon arrival to Belarus for the entire duration of your stay(until your visa expires) - you won\'t have to worry about/pay for registration again. Legally, you should re-register if you stay somewhere else for more than 5 days, but no one will bother you about this...\n\n\'\'\'3. Couchsurfing+hotels\'\'\'\nThis is the most complicated option. Hotels will only register you for the duration of your booking. Once you check out, you\'re no longer considered registered. Therefore, if you then stay with someone through couchsurfing, you\'d need to register immediately, in person, as in option 2. If you register with a host first (regardless for how long) and \'\'\'then\'\'\' stay at a hotel, your previous registration becomes void and the hotel registration applies, so the moment you check out you need to re-register somewhere else (either stay in another hotel or register with a host - again the 5 day period won\'t apply). You could ask the hotel to not stamp your card, so that your previous registration is still valid during and after your hotel stay but this is technically illegal and up to the receptionist\'s discretion. ([[user:uncle_sam01|uncle_sam01]] got his hotel stamp on a sticky note with a "you-naughty-boy" gesture from the receptionist...) \n\n\'\'\'Lack of and/or incorrect registration will lead to fines for you and your host, sometimes even deportation!!! (if your host had a previous guest who also screwed up their registration, they\'d be considered a repeat offender and would face a higher fine)\'\'\'\n\nBasically, plan your first night in Belarus with a CS host and register with them until your visa expires. If you stay at a hotel afterwards, make sure they don\'t stamp your migration card any more. Registration sounds way scarier than it is and shouldn\'t deter you from visiting Belarus.\n\n== Border crossing ==\n\nBelarus is neither in the [[European Union]] nor in the [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen]] Common Travel Area, and most non-[[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] nationals would require a visa to enter the country. However, since July 2018 there is a possibility to enter the country without visa for citizens of about 80 foreign countries. See "Visa" section. \n\nYou can check [http://gpk.gov.by/en/maps/ochered.php border crossing queues] and find more [http://gpk.gov.by/en/maps/ detailed info about border crossings] at the web-site of State Border Committee of the Republic of Belarus.\n\n=== With [[Latvia]] (from east to west)===\n* \'\'Urbany (BLR) / Silene (LV)\'\' {{Coords|55.718463|26.8721013|1}} (bel.

Since the crossing is for pedestrians/cyclists only, you are likely to be the only person there. There aren\'t many parked cars, but just enough to get you picked up to the nearest village on the Polish side (it\'s not very far, so you can walk, as well). On the Belarusian side, you can either try hitch-hiking towards the nearest village of Biely Liasok (bel.

(August 2018)\n\n=== With [[Russia]] ===\n\nPlease note that while there is no border control between Belarus and Russia Belarusian transit visa is still required for foreigners when transiting through the country from Russia to Poland, or vice versa. You can\'t get a visa at the border. If you go from Belarus to Russia make sure that you always keep your Belarusian migration card. The border is open, there is most likely no control and this means, that you will not recieve a Immigration card or an Entry stamp from Russia. Due to the Customs union between the countries, your card from Belarus also counts in Russia and in case you lose it you will find yourself in unfriendly situation.\n\n\'\'\'UPDATE\'\'\' (2017): Third country nationals (ie. not [[CIS]]) are no longer allowed to cross the Belarus/Russia border even with a valid visa for both countries, due to reciprocity measures undertaken by the Russian Government because of EU sanctions. Non-CIS travelers are redirected to cross from Lithuania or Ukraine. There are checks at all major transit points.

The main motorway ([[:Category:E75|E75]]/[[Autoput]]) runs close to the centre of the city from the northwest to the southeast. Most cars also use this as a normal road so hitching out of Belgrade is quite difficult.\n\n== Hitching out ==\n=== Southeast towards [[Niš]], [[Sofia]], [[Skopje]] {{European Route Number|75}} ===\nThere are several possibilities.\n\n==== Bus 493 ====\nThis bus leaves the Central Bus Station of Belgrade for Mladenovac and passes through the new toll station at Vrčin. Ask the bus driver to drop you off right there, user [[Jungma]] observed two locals doing the very same thing. \n\nBus 461 leaves from Šumice and goes to Vrčin, however this means you will have to walk for about 1.5km from the stop at \'Vrčin Ivo Lola Ribar (врчин иво лола рибар)\'. You will travel a long way down the highway without stopping, don\'t worry. After you get out, cross over the highway and take the first right turn down the street \'Moše Pijade (моше пијаде)\'. Keep following this road next to the highway and after about 1.5km you will see the toll station which you can start hitching from.\n\n==== Bus 31 ====\nTake bus 31 from the city centre (from the squares \'\'Trg Studentski\'\' or \'\'Trg Slavia\'\' or in front of the large McDonalds) or bus number 17 going from Zemun, through Novi Beograd, until you get to the intersection of the streets \'\'Ustanička\'\' and \'\'Vojislava Ilića\'\' (ask someone in the bus for the stop \'\'Sumice\'\', but in case you miss is it two stops before the last - on the right you will see a pekara and it\'s a bigger intersection after going uphill for a while). Turn around and go left, walk to the bridge, cross it, go downstairs, and walk around 150m to the right from the bridge. There you will find a on-ramp to the motorway, and it is the spot from where you can hitchhike towards the toll station. (Alternatively you can walk down the motorway for a couple of hundred meters further and talk to people on a petrol station. This might work better, because many people using the on-ramp are not leaving Belgrade). You should have sign which says "RAMPA" (toll station) or "Vrčin" (where the new toll station is located) in order to get a lift, otherwise you risk staying there for a long time. Once you reach the toll station, it is easy to get direct rides all the way to Greece, Bulgaria, Macedonia or even Turkey if the driver allows you to sleep the night in his truck.\n* \'\'[[User:Nero12|Nero12]] (July 2011) Yup, it works great.\'\'\n* \'\'[[User:Rozwal|Rozwal]] (October 2011) had a sign RAMPA and got a ride with a man going out of the highway just before Rampa so the sign proved very very useful.\'\'\n* \'\'[[User:NixyJungle|NixyJungle]]\'\' (2011-2015) I was HH two times on the "on ramp" and waiting for about 30 minutes until I got a ride. Not good spot at all. Most of the cars go inside the city. Walk to the petrol station called AVIA (200 meters). You will see it from this "on ramp" spot. I hitchhiked there many times. Not so much cars, but the ones that stop for petrol, usually go to the toll gate Bubanj Potok. Depends on traffic, you could wait between 1 and 30 minutes. At least, you are not standing on a dusty road, but waiting like a gentleman for a car to pick you up :)\n* \'\'[[User:TurtleGrass|TurtleGrass]] (August 2015) Went with this option, following the \'RAMPA\' advice, worked out great! Only waited about 30mins.\n* [[User:Antonopa|Antonopa]] (May 2016) Works great, I had to wait about 5 mins to get to the toll station, then about an hour to get a ride from the toll station all the way to Niš. Watch out for the police though, they will move you further down the road if you stand too close to the toll station.\n* [[User:Antonopa|Antonopa]] (April 2017) second time using this spot, it\'s perfect, a lot of traffic heading in the right direction, very easy to get a lift over to the toll station, and from there easy to catch a ride with a truck. Made the trip from belgrade to skopje in 10hrs starting from here at 1200.\n* [[User:Janos|Janos]] (June 2018) The toll station in BUBANJ POTOK is not in use anymore! There is a new toll station in in VRČIN (some 5 km further). I waited for an hour at the gas station, then decided to start asking people directly and the first person took me.\n* [[User:justgettingaround|Justgettingaround]] (August 2019) Went to the petrol station and asked directly; got a ride within 5 minutes from some really cool musicians going to Skopje. Wasn´t headed there; got off before the toll station and started hitching with trucks through pretty much the entire country. Super kind guys, made sure we got as far as they could get us, made it to Bulgarian border until our driver got screwed bc he forgot his ID and we had to hitch at the border crossing; no trouble at all, though, got in a cute lil van and made it to Sofia from Belgrade in one day. Was recommended to write signs in both the Latin/Romanic and Cyrillic alphabets. \n\n==== Trolleybus 29 ====\nAlternative (worked very well, a number of times, requires very little walking/riding on busses): If you are in the downtown area, past Slavia, near the big market and Mackenzie street (serbian: Makenzijeva ulica), you can take trolleybus 29 out until it comes to a long bridge with blue railings. This bridge crosses the motorway (among many other things). If you get out before the bridge and cross to the side where traffic is coming in the opposite direction (don\'t go all the way across the length of the bridge), there are stairs going down that lead to the motorway, from which, you can walk just a few meters and find a shoulder with enough space for cars to pull over, perfect for hitchhiking!\n\n- [[User:Chillion|Chillion]] (2018) This method is relatively easy, as long as you excerise caution. I missed the blue railing bridge by a stop after, so had to walk back which took 10 mins. Getting to the spot requires care. Took me about 1 hr to get a ride, only because I was using the wrong sign (NS for Novi Sad, I thought it meant Nis). When I used the correct sign (Nis-Nais) I got picked up in less than 10 mins. Arrived in Sofia that same day (luck was severely on my side). It is very likely that you\'ll also be able to catch a ride straight to Nis on this spot.\n\nNote: Jeremie used this spot and would like it made clear that it is dangereous, even if it works well.\n\n2nd note: Wouter and Michiel used this spot an stood along the motorway for 3 hours holding a big Niš sign without being picked up. They eventually decided to take the bus to Sofia.\n\n==== Tram 7 ====\nThis option involves less walking along the motorway. From the city centre, take tram 7 in the direction south-east until the last stop (takes about 15 minutes, depending on the traffic). From there take bus 308, direction Veliki Mokri Lug (sometimes written as V.M.L.). After about ten minutes you will cross a bridge going over the motorway; get out at the next stop 100 meters later. From the bridge you will already see the petrol station where you want to go, which is about 200 meters walking. This petrol station is also located uphill. (This info is not entirely correct, I spent 4 hours while trying to get out of Belgrade. There is no way to reach the stop of 308 with Tram 7. You have to get off at Vukadin memorial or shortly Vuk and from there on, walk to a nearby kiosk and catch bus 6A, then go to the last stop Ustanicka and walk down the street. There you can catch 308 to VML. The petrol station is a pretty good place to hitchhike, just don\'t be in it, cause there\'s just a few cars stopping and you\'ll be waiting quite a lot)\n(well, info is good - but from time to time officials do some tram-track repair, so tram 7 doesn\'t go further then Vukov spomenik (also, not Vukadin, his name was Vuk). In that case bus 6a runs. Otherwise, going to last stop Ustanička and going down stairs through this big mall and crossing the street will bring you to bus 308 stop).\n\nA sign saying "10 K.M." might be helpful in catching a local car which can take you to the first toll stop (a hitchhiking stop regularly used by locals) and out of the intense exhaust fumes.\n\nIf you\'re heading for Niš (or beyond) try using a sign (saying Niš). If going beyond Niš remember to leave the car *on the motorway* - not in Niš, unless you\'re a big fan of walking. About two hundred meters before the motorway split Niš and Sofia ([[Bulgaria]]) is an working toll station where you can easily find a long distance ride.\n\nTo hitchhike towards Niš, you should first reach the toll station, which can be a bit tricky, since you have to hitchhike while you are still in the city.\n\nFind the map on http://www.serbiatravelers.org/en/index.php/hitchhiking/145-beograd\n\n\n==== Bus 26 ====\nThis option is easy and works well if you like hitching from service stations and asking people instead of tolls/signs on the side of the road.\nFrom the city center bus station "Trg Republike" take bus 26 towards "Nazelje Brace Jerkovic" until "Peke Pavlovika" (11 stops, 25minutes, costs 150 Serbia  Dinars) which is the second stop after the bus crosses over the highway. From the bus stop it is only 10 minutes walking towards the East to reach the highway at a place where you get to a service station from the company "MOL" and there is no fence!\nSome local people will tell you to go to another place nearby where you can stand by the road - it is used by locals but way more dangerous than the fuel station!\n\n* [[User:MartinJ888|MartinJ888]] August 2022: Hitched there with a friend (two men), it took us about 1 hour to get a ride towards Nis.\n\n=== Southwest towards [[Sarajevo]] and [[Montenegro]] ===\n[[File:Donraspunicum.jpeg|right|thumb|150px|[[User:Kristian|Kristian]] hitchhiking towards [[Čačak]] in Belgrade (2013)]]\nThere are 2 ways to Sarajevo, one through Čačak-Uzice, a bit south, the other one more direct but not written on online maps... The one through Čačak worked well for us. Take the bus 53 from the green open market called "Zelena pijaca" (the stop is called \'\'Zeleni venac\'\') in the center, to the last station (\'\'Vidikovac\'\'). Then just follow the street for one minute, turn right, here is the exit to the motorway, climb up the bridge and try to hitchhike there, there is some place for cars to pull over, but in Serbia when they want to stop the car the dont really need a proper place ;). It seems that buses 531, 532, 533 go further, but it\'s not really needed, and they might be regional buses. Use signs ČA and/or UE (ČaČak-Uzice). [[User:P40fA|Jan]] hitched a ride to Čačak in Sep 2018 here in ten minutes.\n\nThis way through Čačak-Uzice is not the fastest but in t0ma5´s opinion very interesting, it will take you 6-7 hours to reach Sarajevo and before leaving Serbia you will pass near by GuČa, where a crazy Balkan music festival takes place every summer and just before the Bosnian border is Mokra Gora, the ethno village that the filmmaker Kusturica made for his movie, Life is a Miracle, you can visit it in few hours if you have the times but there is entrance fee.\n\nAfter Uzice there is not much traffic going to Bosnia since after the border and before Sarajevo there is not any big city, so if you get a ride the driver will probably take u all the way to Sarajevo :)\n\nThis route is also useful to get to Montenegro - just use the \'\'Montenegro\'\' or \'\'MNE\'\' sign after you get out of Belgrade. The drivers usually go through Nova Varoš and Bijelo Polje.\n\n=== North towards [[Novi Sad]] and [[Budapest]] {{European Route Number|75}} ===\nIt\'s best to take bus number 706 from Zeleni Venac station (big bus station in the city center) to Batajnica, around 15 kilometers away and 40 minutes by bus (depending on traffic jams). The same bus goes through Zemun. You also have 706E, which is an express bus, faster than 706, and starts from Zemun (Kej Oslobodjenja - Zemun center) going to Batajnica. You can also take bus number 73 from New Belgrade. Ask the driver to let you off at Batajnica where the highway crosses the bus road.\n\nThere is a map on http://www.serbiatravelers.org/en/index.php/hitchhiking/145-beograd\n\nIf you wish to hitchhike on the motorway, you should exit at the overpass just before entering Batajnica and walk up to the highway. There is a lot of space for cars to pull down. Try to get any ride to the highway toll gate / péage on the way to [[Novi Sad]], where all cars have to stop. There you can ask people to take you further, even to Hungary (edited by [[User:NixyJungle|NixyJungle]]).\n\n* [[User:Evolverine]] Hitchhiking on the highway was awful, cars going way too fast to even consider picking anyone up. Plus I was confused by the supposed toll booth / péage that I just couldn\'t find (it is near [[Novi Sad]], so don\'t bother looking for it; I updated the wiki to make it more clear). So after a couple of minutes I went to the road the cars from Belgrade took to get onto the highway, here [{{Coords|44.88789305090904|20.30195116996765}}] / geo:44.88789,20.30195?z=17 (not marked on the map above), and in about 2h I got a ride to the border with Hungary, after which it was easy to get another ride to [[Budapest]]. But the general feeling that it\'s hard to hitch out of Belgrade seems accurate.\n* [[User:Luelle]] Another option if you don\'t want to ride a bus for so long: Take the 95 Bus from the city center to New Belgrade and exit at the station called Sava Center. It stops directly passed a bridge that is over the highway. Exit the bus and walk towards the bridge, you will see a petrol station on the highway to the right which is the direction Novi Sad/ Budapest. This a petrol station which you can use to get a short ride out of the city. Finding a long ride is pretty unlikely from this point since its mostly local traffic. Beware: Bring some cardboard with you. There isn\'t anything around.\n* [[User:schlaraffenkind]] I found a different and much easier way to hitchhike out of Belgrade. Take the Bus 601 from New Belgrade to the bus station "Tošin bunar". From Tošin bunar take bus 611 to the station "Zmaj". It stops right in front of a petrol station which is also called (Benzinska stanica NIS Petrol) "Zmaj" (2 stops from Tošin bunar but it\'s also so obvious, it will be hard to miss). It\'s outside of the city and on the E-70 motorway. The motorway that leads straight to Zagreb and is right before the junction that leads to Budapest. Definitely try this route if you are in doubt about the others. I got a ride within 5 minutes towards Novi Sad and then just before Novi Sad another one to the border with Hungary.\n\nwww.instagram.com/santi_viajasimplemente/\nIt is possible to take the underground or train to the station zemun that goes to batajnica every hour and seems to be free :), from there walk 600 to the service station with McDonald\'s. I got a ride there after 1 hour.\n\n=== Northeast towards [[Timișoara]] ([[Romania]]) {{European Route Number|70}} ===\nTake a bus from the center (25/25-P will work) to the base of the \'\'Pančevački most\'\' (the bridge over Dunav/Danube -- not any of the ones over the Sava). Take another bus (e.g. 101, 102, 103...) over the bridge, and get off at the first stop after the bridge. Turn around and walk to the elevated motorway back in the direction the bus came (<\xa0100\xa0m). This is the E-70. Coming from the bus stop, the direction East is on the far side of the motorway, so you need to walk under it and then climb up to the level of the highway. Walk right along it (there is a guardrail, so it\'s not too scary) until you come to a traffic light with a place for buses/cars to pull over immediately afterwards. This is the perfect hitch spot. Continue on the E70 towards Pančevo and Vršač and eventually the [[Stamora Moravița-Vatin border crossing]] into Romania. Be aware that Romanian drivers may expect money, so if a car with a Romanian number plate stops, explain that you will not pay.\n\n\'\'\'MARCH 2017\'\'\': I recommend you to take the bus that goes right away from Belgrade to Pančevo (I think number 95, but check it). Once you are in that village it goes super fast. It takes longer to go first to that spot after the bridge and find a straight ride to Timișoara than going first to Pančevo, because most of the cars go to small villages around, and normally the ones that leave from that village go to Timișoara.\n\n=== West towards [[Zagreb]] {{European Route Number|70}} ===\nTake bus no. 16 or 17 from the upper part of Zeleni Venac station towards Novi Beograd, and exit after you pass traffic circle. Cross the street, and take bus no. 611. To check bus connections: [http://www.eway.rs/en/cities/beograd/routes] . That bus will take you to the motorway, some 20 kilometers from Belgrade. Get off as soon as the bus turns from the motorway, and then return to the motorway. Start hitchhiking there. \nThe toll station is around 7-8 kilometers far, but there\'s no need to go there on foot. When cars stop, ask them to take you at least until the toll station. If they leave the last exit before, they can drop you off there. (There is a gas station, what can be reached from behind). You can walk from there to the toll station (ca. 1 km).\nOnce you get to the toll station, we recommend using a sign for the direction you want to go, it is a good opportunity to get a direct ride, even all the way to Zagreb.\n\nFrom Belgrade to Zagreb advice is good you take bus 611 to end of town. Better not try to hitchhike on first petrol station Zmaj after Novi Belgrade, you can really stuck there for few hours. Hundreds of cars coming on that place but almost all of them were going back to Belgrade or to Novi Sad and just few of them to Croatia. Take  611 and go out just near road to air port than you just walk few minute on high way and come to petrol station. That is last  petrol station in direction to Croatia and there also  people can turn to Novi Sad and not in direction to Croatia. You just need to catch ride to pay tolls. When you at pay tolls, there is much  easier to catch ride to Zagreb or any part of Croatia.(June 2013)\n\nJust to write some more info, (June 2014). This time it was much easier to catch ride even on petrols station Zmaj outside of Novi Belgrade and without going more further with bus 616 to last petrol station near airport and pay tolls. It was same as last year a lot of cars where there on Zmaj petrol station and a lot of them were going back to Belgrade(It was mistake last year to ask drivers if they go to Croatia, just ask everyone to get you to pay tolls in Šimanovci) . Speak with people that work on petrol station an they will help you to catch ride, ask every driver just to drive you to Šimanovci-name of place where pay tolls are and from there is much easier to move forward Croatia. On Zmaj petrol station is forbidden to stop for trucks(specially for foreign trucks, trucks can not drive through Belgrade), only trucks with special license can stop there and  they will be local Serbian trucks but they can go to pay tolls, try to ask them. On second petrol station after airport is allowed for all trucks. There are also helpful people that work on petrols station or girls that cleans cars to catch some money for summer , they could help you if you ask them. Serbian registration that could go to pay tolls are ŠI, RU,  SM ask them or any other foreign driver, they will all go to pay tolls or Croatia.\n\nIf you want to hitchhiking directly from the toll station, it is also possible, but quite a long way. You are sure to get a ride pretty far though, it might be useful if you want to have a long ride. In April 2018, I`ve waited 1min and got a ride direct to Munich.\nHow to get there : find a bus that goes to Novi Beograd and take the bus 711 in direction of Simanovci, the village where there is the toll station. \nYou can take for example bus 65 from Zeleni Venac (the bus passes in the street, not in the bus station ; the street is Zeleni Venac and it goes across the bridge towards Zemun, Novi Beograd, etc.) and get out at stop Pariske Komune after a big round about. From there, come back to the round about and take a left on Bulevar Mihajla Pupina. Stay on the side of the road where cars go towards the round about, not from the round about! And walk a minute to the next bus stop and take the 711 til the last stop named Simanovci Centar. This is a 50min ride and you can easily blackride the bus.\nfor info about the 711 bus https://www.busevi.com/mapa-linije-711-novi-beograd-paviljoni-ugrinovci-izlaz-simanovci/\nFrom Simanovci Centar, continue straight on the main road for about 20min. Take a left on Dositejeva ulica for about 5min and you`re there!\n\n== Blackriding ==\nControllors are going into the vehicles with a mini computer for checking your e-cards (cards are called BusPlus). Normal BusPlus cards are blue coloured and they have red ones. When you spot them, just ignore them and leave on the next stop. Controls are quite common and with the new pricing system, a single ride bought from the driver is quite expensive (150 dinars).\n\n== WiFi ==\n* Main train station: network \'\'Peron\'\' code \'\'internet\'\' (they have changed it already, but in the smaller hall /not the one they sell train tickets in, but with the money exchange office/, you can catch some wifis without passwords, something like AUDInumbers)\n* Studentski Park has free wifi, just look for an open network that has the word \'free\' in it.\n\n== Sleeping ==\nWe slept near the river, under the bridge we came in at 5am and slept until 1300 no one disturbed us.\n\n[[nomad:Belgrade]]\n\n[[Category:Serbia]]\n[[Category:E75]]\n[[Category:E70]]\n[[fr:Belgrade]]\n__NOTOC__'},

Take bus 8 in direction of \'\'Valentin\'\' from the bus stop \'\'Battant\'\'in the centre of Besançon until the stop \'\'Echangeur Valentin\'\' (it\'s almost the end of the bus route). Then walk in the direction of McD and you will see the péage. You should use a sign or ask people because cars are going both south/west and east from here. There\'s a gendarmerie here, but policemen don\'t seem to care about hitchhikers. Note that there are no buses on Sundays so you should walk there, it\'s about 6&nbsp;km. \n\n====To get to the Peage====\n{{Coords|47.2545|6.0148}}<br>\nFrom the center, you can walk to "rue de Vesoul", and there is a bus spot a little bit more after the station AVIA, next to a school. Using a sign with Valentin should be easy. It takes about 30 minutes walking from pont battant in the center.\n\n===Aire de Besançon===\n{{Coords|47.3272|6.1278}} Going east<br>\n{{Coords|47.3296|6.1273}} Going west<br>\nAnother, better, option depénding on the time and day of leaving Besançon, is to go the service station \'\'Aire de Besançon Champoux\'\' and \'\'Aire de Besançon Marchaux\'\' in heading west and éast, respectively.\nTo reach the service station, take bus 71 at the bus station \'\'Orchamps\'\'. You can cônsult the timetable here [[timetable]] to know the departing times. Alight at the 9th stop, \'\'Champoux-Mairie\'\', then walk back on the D346 where the bus was coming from until you reach the motorway, then turn right on D138 and walk to the service station, about 10-15 minutes total walking. If you are heading east, there is a footbridge to take you to McD then to the station on the other side.\n\n=== Southeast toward [[Pontarlier]], [[Lausanne]] {{E|23}} ===\n{{Coords|47.2299|6.0369}}<br>\nThe spot is at the petrol station, and never takes more than 30 min (can be 4...). For this you have to walk out of the centre to the crossing called \'\'Rivotte\'\' (near the tunnel under the citadel), then follow the road in direction of [[Pontarlier]]. Next good point is the \'\'round-about\'\' {{Coords|47.157739|6.2522507|1}} close to [[Valdahon]], don\'t take a ride which goes closer than this point.\n\n=== North towards [[Vesoul]] or [[Vosges]] ===\n{{Coords|47.2545|6.0148}}<br>\nSame spot to get to Valentin from the center as described above. Wait for a long ride, or ask if people can stop you in \'\'Cayenne\'\', or next to \'\'Quenoche\'\' where cars have to slow down. Don\'t go to Rioz.\n\n=== North towards [[Gray]] ===\nTake tramway 2 or 1 until the end, direction \'\'haut de chazal\'\'. Walk 20 minutes to \'\'Franois\'\', until the second roundabout. Take the D75 direction, and stop at the next roundabout, then it\'s easy to get a ride towards Marnay and Gray. \n\nYou can also go to the motorway A36 entrance from this spot.\n\n== Public transport ==\n\nA local bus ticket costs EUR 1.40 and is valid for one hour on any buses or/and tramway.\nBe careful on Sundays there is \'\'\'no\'\'\' bus to go the péage! But you can hitch to an other péage from the end of the tramway line \'\'haut de chazal\'\'.

 'Bilbao': {'text': '\'\'\'{{FULLPAGENAME}}\'\'\' is a city in [[Spain]].\n\n== Hitchhiking out ==\n\n=== Towards [[Donostia-San Sebastián|San Sebastian]] ===\n====Option 1====\n{{Coords|43.2303|-2.7544}}<br>\nThe gas station "Amorbieta" is some 10 km east of Bilbao. It can be easily reached by public transport: Take a bus from the bus terminal heading to Lekeitio (ask which number, in 08/2017 there were 2 busses to Lekeitio but only one went to Boroa, No.3523) and get off at "Boroa" Bus stop (20 minutes, €1,50 ; From the stop, walk along the street for some 50 m, turn left, walk over the bridge and in the roundabout turn left and go down to the gas station. It\'s pretty easy to get a ride from here (I didn\'t check if cou can also go to the other side\'s station, but I suppose).\n\n====Option 2====\nHeading toward San Sebastian there is a roundabout near the airport on the strada (street not the motorway) you can wait at. That was much quicker for Markus than waiting near the toll where the road goes in 2 directions.\n\n====Option 3====\nNear the toll there are traffic lights, but better is a little further on where the road forks, though its not a good place to wait as its in the middle of the road it is possible. The 2 directions are Santander and San Sebastian.\n\n====Option 4====\nAnother spot to hitch to San Sebastian: take the metro to Etxebarri and walk to this spot: (enter the coordinates 43.235063,-2.868845 in Google maps). I got a ride there although it took 45 minutes and the cars were whizzing by.\n\n====Option 5====\n{{Coords|43.3061|-2.8981}}<br>\nA tips which hasn\'t been tested : there is a gas station on the airport . This is an international airport and there is a lot of french and spanish who use it. You can ask here for a ride toward San Sebastian.\nYou can reach the airport with a bus from the Termibus [http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/478606698#map=19/43.26032/-2.94978].\n\n=== Toward [[Santander]] ===\nThe A8-E70 starts in downtown Bilbao. We tried there without success. Not much space for cars to stop.\n\nSo instead we took the subway to the last station on the red line: Santurtzi. When you get to the Santurtzi station go to the exit that leads another small train that just takes 5 minutes, in order to take the passangers stright up to Parque Santurtzi. From there you just go down towards the water and then follow the road and it will lead to the highway entrance. We waited 10 minutes and then got a ride to santander.\n\n\n=== Toward South [[Vitoria]] ===\n\nThis option worked for me to return to Barcelona, but could be useful to go to Logroño, Burgos, Madrid, Zaragoza, etc.\nFrom Bilbao, the main motorway leaving to the south is A8 and then it becomes Ap-68. I tried to access it from Arrigorriaga city which is connected with the Ap-68, by taking the train to this place (1,95€ on december 2016), only 15 min from Abanda Station on the main center of Bilbao. There is a gas station in that on the motorway at the level of that city, but is unaccessible from there unless you go by car. Otherwise it would force you to walk on the motorway, which i don\'t suggest, with the risk of accidents or the police catching you, but at least, you could stay on the last roundabout before the motorway and write a sign to "Estación de Servicio" (Service station), together with your final destination, and at least get a ride of 2km to that gas station.\nI didn\'t see that much movement of cars, so it helps you to have a little talk with drivers and convince them by the little previous contact. 30 Km from that spot there is another Gas station with similar conditions. I made Bilbao to Barcelona in two cars, but i have to say i was quite lucky. Don\'t take it as normal, but anyway, is a good spot and at least you will be on the right way.\n\n=== Toward [[Burgos]] ===\n\nTrain till Ugao-Miraballes station and walk Ondategui Auzoa road  2 km to Arrigoriaga rest stop\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n{{IsIn|Spain}}\n\n[[Category:Spain]]\n\n[[fr:Bilbao]]'},

It\'s the capital city of the [[Aquitaine]] region.\n\n== Hitchhiking out ==\n\nBordeaux is encircled by a ring road (\'\'rocade\'\' in french), a fast dual-carriageway bypass, with no places to stop and pick up hitchhikers, and peages are far and not easy to reach by walking or public transport. This makes leaving Bordeaux very tricky, although not impossible. It is best to hitchhike on the approach roads to the ring road in the direction you wish to travel. It is advised to avoid going into the town centre.\n\n=== North towards [[Tours]], [[Paris]] ===\n\nTotal gas station on the ring road\n\nTake the tram A to Gravières stop. Follow the street Rue des Gravières/Rue François Villon which is on the right hand side just before the tram arrives at the stop from the city centre. At a big crossroad, go left down the big crossing road named Avenue de Paris. There is a small road parallel of this street in the industrial estate, take it (rue Jean Raymond Guyon). It ends to a roundabout but here is a small old pedestrian road. Take it. Cross the bridge that crosses the motorway. From it, you can see two Total gas station on different sides of the road. The fences are broken so you can walk easily to the furthest one away for the North (Paris, etc.)\n\nAsk for going to the next BP gas station, just before “Saint André de Cubzac” if nobody takes the A10. At the next petrol station, there is a restaurant, so a lot more people.\n\nFor the south one can use the first service station seen from the pedestrian bridge.\n\n=== East towards Perigeux, [[Clermont-Ferrand]], [[Lyon]] ===\n\nA big outward road leads from the city center over bridges over the Dordogne, over the ring motorway and later becomes the motorway A 89 (E 70) to the east. Shortly after it crosses the ring there is a good spot: There is a junction, where all the eastbound traffic from the ring joins. One may ask waiting drivers at the traffic lights or stand beside the road after that, because it is not a motorway yet. Drivers can see you there and go slow because normally everyone has to stop at the traffic lights, and there is a broad hard shoulder and bus stops, where one can safely stop and continue. A few hundred meters further there is also a small dedicated fStation Carrefour Lormont Fuel station on that road\n\nTo get there on public transit, take the purple line A (both lines to Dravemont or La Gardette bassens work) from the city center to the stop Buttinière. The line follows a big avenue (Avenue Carnot) for roughly 3km. At Buttinière you get out and walk along that same Avenue Carnot for another 1-1.5km passing on your left first the Polyclinique de Bordeaux then a gigantic Carrefour supermarket and stop lights. \n\n=== South towards [[Bayonne]], [[Toulouse]], [[Barcelona]] ([[Spain]]) ===\n\n\'\'\'Option 1\'\'\' Total gas station on the ring road\n\nTake the tram A to Gravières stop. Follow the street Rue des Gravières/Rue François Villon which is on the right hand side just before the tram arrives at the stop from the city centre. At a big crossroad, go left down the big crossing road named Avenue de Paris. There is a small road parallel of this street in the industrial estate, take it (rue Jean Raymond Guyon). It ends to a roundabout but here is a small old pedestrian road. Take it. Cross the bridge that crosses the motorway. From it, you can see two Total gas station on different sides of the road. For the south one can use the first service station seen from the pedestrian bridge.\n\n\n\'\'\'Option 2\'\'\'\n\nCloser to the entrance of the highway. Take the bus #15 towards "Villenave d\'Ornon" and exit at "Pont de la Maye" (you can ask the bus driver to tell you when it is). Then, walk in the same direction that the bus went, on the road. Cross the bridge above the road. Just after the bridge there is a little grassy hill on the right. Walk down the hill. You\'ll arrive on a roundabout with a road going directly to A62 ([[Toulouse]]). There is some space on the roundabout so the cars can stop and pick you up relatively easily. \n\n\n\'\'\'Option 3\'\'\'\n\nYou can take the tram B towards Pessac Centre and get off at Montaigne-Montesquieu stop. Then you can walk through the Ecole D\'architecture university to this spot: \'\'see map\'\' {{Coords|44.7919076|-0.6069205|1}}. The cars there will most probably take the A63 that goes south. There is a bus stop (Ecole d\'architecture) where you can stand with a sign and the cars will have space to stop and don\'t go very fast. You can choose a bus stop Ecole de Management, which is just before university\n\n\n== Public transport ==\n\nIn the tramway, there are very few controls, but there is no way to avoid the control when it happens.

You can check the spot on [https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2095595179 OpenStreetMap].\n\nTo get there:\n* \'\'\'On foot\'\'\' (~5 km from the city center): Head southwest via \'\'Avenue Marcel Haegelen\'\', continue straight on \'\'Avenue d’Issoudun\'\', then follow blue signs to the autoroute. The toll station is just past the roundabout.\n* \'\'\'By public transport\'\'\' (as of 30/04/2018): Take **bus 8** towards "Salengro (St-Florent-sur-Cher)" and get off at "Marcel Dassault". Then follow the road straight through one roundabout, take a left at the second, and then the second right at the third roundabout. The walk is about 10 minutes.

It is the 7th largest Romanian city, after [[Bucureşti|Bucharest]], [[Cluj-Napoca]], [[Timişoara]], [[Iaşi]], [[Craiova]] and [[Galaţi]]. Braşov is located in the central part of the country, about 166 km from Bucharest. It is surrounded by the Southern Carpathians, and is part of the [[Transylvania]] region.\n\n== Hitching out ==\n\n=== South towards Sinaia, [[Bucureşti|Bucharest]] {{European Route Number|60}} ===\n\nBucharest: From the train station (\'\'gara\'\') take the bus number 8 or 23 until the last stop. On the other side of the road you will see McDonalds, walk a bit further where the cars can stop. \n\nAlternatively, from the Old City, station \'\'\'Livada Poștei\'\' {{Coords|45.6455145|25.5861363|1}}\' take bus number 17 until the \'\'\'Aurora\'\' {{Coords|45.6182128|25.6484279|1}}\' stop, then walk a bit to the next gas station.\n\n=== Northwest towards [[Târgu Mureş]], [[Cluj-Napoca]] {{European Route Number|60}} ===\n\nFrom the city centre you can take bus 36 to Independentei. From there, you can walk northwest to the big road. Walk along the road until you see a speed bump. This is the ideal spot for you to hitchhike. All the cars will slow down and see you and they have plenty of space to pull over.\n\nIts much better to catch a bus to TIPOGRAFIA BRASTAR ( check on google maps).Its 100% better and just 2 kms ahead but on beginning of highway which looks like National Road really. From Center Bus Number 18 and 40 go here all the time. Otherwise google transport this place. Once you reach this bus stop just walk 100 meters back to MOL GAS STATION Or SOCAR GAS STATION. This is the best spot to talk to driver and Cluj Turda or nearby places. Perfect Spot.\n\n=== West towards Sibiu {{European Route Number|68}} ===\n\nThe road section from the intersection str. Lunga and sos. Cristianului (Bartolomeu area) to the bridge. You can reach Bartolomeu from the center by buses number 28 and 5.Definitely use a sign reading "Sibiu". Do not stay where people wait for the direction Rasnov, Bran but go 100 m away.\n\n\nRasnov, Bran : in the intersection str. Lunga and sos. Cristianului (Bartolomeu area)\n\nBacau, Sf.

Here you are already on the road E60 and you start hitchhiking directly from the bus stop. The E60 will also take you to the Road E68 which is the road going directly to Sibiu so it might be better to use a sign that says you want to go to Sighişoara.\n\n=== Northeast towards [[Onești]], [[Bacău]]  {{European Route Number|574}} === \n\nFrom Autogara 3 you can catch a bus to Hărman. When you reach the bus station, named "Gara Hărman", stop there and hitchhike with your sign from the bus station where there is plenty of space for a car or a truck to stop.

Just after the traffic lights there is a pub, "The Airport Tavern", a total of 10 min walk from the airport building. Cars tend to go slow as the pub is right after the traffic lights, and in front of the pub there is enough space for them to stop. About 40 yards away towards Bristol there is a bus stop with even more space. Waiting times of less than 30min were experienced an early sunday morning, but during busier times it might be less.  \n\n=== Along A38 ===\n\nIf you are in the South Bristol Cemetery area, next to the Langford Road Bus station there is  a recess in the road used as parking spot with plenty of space for cars to stop. This is not a busy spot, but waiting times of less than 30 minutes are nonetheless been experienced. \n\n== Hitchhiking Out ==\n\n=== To [[London]], [[Birmingham]] & [[Cardiff]] ===\n\nThere are two spots to leave Bristol from the center, the \'\'M32 Silvey Services\'\' {{Coords|51.460854|-2.58154|1}} opposite Staples. This is a Shell petrol station, which is an excellent hitching spot. Signing from just next to the exit, cars are able to pull in or pick you up as they leave the petrol station and whilst not all lanes can pick you up, you are highly visible and all cars will pass you. Normally less than 15 minute wait, though Jonathan has waited up to 90 minutes. Many cars will not be going to London but don\'t be stressed.\n\nAbout one kilometer further [https://maps.hitchwiki.org/?lat=51.4665740992362&lng=-2.57449150085449&zoom=14&trip=0 after the roundabout] there is a long hard shoulder next with enough space for cars to stop. \n\n\nWhere the [https://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.505035,-2.527571&num=1&t=h&sll=51.483521,-2.532177&sspn=0.067561,0.154324&ie=UTF8&ll=51.483521,-2.532177&spn=0.067561,0.154324&z=13 Avon ring road (A4174) meets the M32] you can try to get a lift standing by the traffic lights next to the roundabout which is right before the slip road. (Which is better than [[M32 (GB)|M32]] in center; but 7 km north of center.)\n\n=== Going north towards [[Birmingham]]/{{Mgb|5}} ===\n\nThere is a bus (number 309 or 310) that goes from the bus station to a village called Almondsbury which is really close to the {{Mgb|5}} and also far away from the Bristol suburbs. This is for those annoyed by hitching around suburb traffic. Alternatively walk north along Gloucester Road and in about 11km you will get there.\n\nA third option is to take the 1, 2, 3, or 54 bus to Cribbs Causeway, get off just before the shopping centre itself. There\'s a roundabout by the Redwood Farm pub (formely the Lamb and Flag) with a lay by of sorts just after it (it\'s actually a junction for a tiny side road). It\'s not a great spot but it\'s a lot nearer than Almondsbury. There\'s also a petrol station a little further back towards Bristol which could be worth a try.\n\n=== Going South towards [[Taunton]] and [[Exeter]]/{{Mgb|5}} ===\n\nM5 junction 19\n\nThe Clifton Suspension Bridge out of town narrows into a one lane   road  over   a ravine , and drivers have to pay a toll to get on. \nWhile you\'re not allowed to wait at the barrier , the time it took for the guy to get out of his booth and walk over to me to tell me this was all the time I needed to get a ride to Exeter (it looked like it wouldn\'t be too hard to wait either before or after the bridge, either). From the city centre, you can get a local bus (#8 and #9 both work) for £1.70 that\'ll take you to within about 200m of the bridge.\n\nThere\'s a big service station near Easton-in-Gordano at {{Mgb|5}} Junction 19 . The good news is, hitching (in my experience) gets easier as you head South and West! Southbound from J19  Easton-in- Gordano services can be very slow at holiday traffic times - two hours or even six , especially in summer.  Northbound  hitching  is  also  dificult. Bristol to J19 is 7 km walk\n\n\n\n\nAnother place  to hitch FROM Bristol to {{Mgb|5}} South is  at the start of A369  - Clanage Rd - by U.W.E  Bower Ashton Art Dept.\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n\n\n\n[[Category:England]]\n[[Category:E30]]'},

Brussels is a very international city. \n\n== Hitching in ==\n=== East ===\nIf you do not encounter a driver that goes inside the city, but instead takes the northern ring road around the city, you can ask them to pull off the motorway (E19) at junction 7a/7b \'\'(Chaussee Romaine/Parc des Expositions/Tentoonstellingspark)\'\' (basically, the Atomium and Heysel Stadium area) or at junction 8 \'\'(Wemmel)\'\'{{Coords|50.90259052095862|4.326904907594108|1}}. At both exits, drivers can immediately rejoin the motorway from the slip road opposite the exit. From the exits, you simply have to walk towards the Expo park to take tram 23, 81, or 94; or Metro 6 from stations \'\'Koning Boudewijn\'\' or \'\'Heysel\'\'.\n\nAlternatively, you might also ask to be left at the service station on the E40 in Leuven, before the ring road around Brussels, with the idea of catching a local ride that would get you into town. This might be necessary if your driver goes up along the E19 to Antwerp, as there won\'t be any places for him to drop you off.\n\n=== Northwest ===\nIf you arrive from the northwest (Gent), you can ask to be dropped at the Services in Groot-Bijgaarden which is 2.5km before the ring of Brussels along the E40 from where you can walk to Zellik and catch bus 213 or 214 to the centre, or try to hitch a ride into town.\n\nIf your ride only takes the western ring road (E19), (from Gent or the south), you can ask to be dropped off at Junction 16 on the E19, from where it is walking distance to the metro 1b stations \'\'Eddy Merckx\'\' or \'\'Ceria\'\'.\n\n=== South ===\nIf you coming in from the south and the driver is heading to the east of Brussels, ask to be dropped off at Delta.\n\nIf the driver is heading to the west of Brussels, ask to be dropped off at E19 junction at Drogenbos. It comes right after Ruisbroek service station (Total). Walk five minutes and you’ll be at the beginning of tram line 4 going to the centre.\n\n== Hitchhiking out ==\n=== North-West towards [[Gent]], [[Brugge]], [[England]], ([[Lille]]) {{E|40}} ===\n==== Option 1: Petrol stations at Baselix Shopping Centre ====\n{{Coords|50.8712|4.2943}}<br>\nTake train S10 from \'\'Brussels Noord\'\' station to \'\'Berchem Ste-Agathe\'\' station. Head south towards the Carrefour hypermarket and go through it\'s car park toward the Baselix Shopping Centre and the main road Keizer Karellaan. Here you will find two petrol stations (Shell and Lukoil).  Stay there as people fill up with petrol for going to e.g. Gent]or Bruges. Just ask people. 1O minutes walk\n\nAlternative way : take bus 213 or 214 from bus-stop \'\'Brussel Rogier\'\' and get off at \'\'Sint-Agatha-Berchem Marg.v.Oostenrijk\'\', and then walk 300m west until you reach the petrol stations. Or walk 5 km from Rogier metro heading west on the main road R20.\n\n==== Option 2: Start of E40 ====\nTake tram 82 from the Gare du Midi in direction of \'\'Berchem\'\' until the stop \'\'Berchem Shopping\'\'. From there turn left and walk up the Av. Charles Quint for about 200 meters and you are at the beginning of the E40 in the direction of Gent. Just hitch after the traffic lights, where there is space for a car to pull over behind you. The circulation is dense but cars can easily pull over and get back on the road quite safely. You can also reach this spot by the following the directions in Option 1 and then continue walking 400m west along the main road R20. \n\n==== Option 3: Motorway service station Groot Bijgaarden ====\n{{Coords|50.8813|4.2539}}<br>\nThe cheapest way: from bus-stop \'\'Brussel Rogier\'\', take De Lijn bus 213 or 214 (direction Aalst) and get off at bus-stop \'\'Zellik Drie Koningen\'\'. Cross over the street and walk back 50m in the direction from where the bus came to the roundabout. Turn into the first street to the right (Kerklaan) and walk 200m. Turn left into Theodoor Coppensstraat and walk ≈650m till you come to the junction with Louis De Bondstraat. Take a left here (south) and walk 400m until you reach a road on the right (Dilbeek Noord). Walk ≈300m and you will reach the service station.\n\nThis spot works extremely well, but it takes some times to get there and it\'s also quite expensive: 2,40€ to get to Gare du Nord (blackriding the tram is easy but metro is hard) plus 3€ for the De Lijn bus (you enter the bus right at the front so you cannot blackride).\n\nMany people also take this route to go to Lille and Paris, and there\'s probably more traffic on this road than on the option going towards Charleroi and Mons.\n\n=== South-West towards [[Charleroi]], [[Mons (Bergen)|Mons]], [[Lille]], [[Paris]] {{E|19}} ===\n==== Option 1: E19 Motorway junction Drogenbos ====\n{{Coords|50.7923|4.3030}}<br>\nAt the Drogenbos motorway junction, there is a  traffic light under the motorway bridge. As cars need to wait to turn left to get on the highway, its possible to ask drivers to take you south. The next gas station \'\'Ruisbroek\'\'{{Coords|50.77763394027698|4.299328123974783|1}} is only 1,5km away\n\nTake bus 50 (direction Lot) to Gilson leaving from Brussels Gare du Midi/Zuidstation. This takes about 20 minutes. Walk southeast along Paul Gilsonlaan, then follow the road round onto Grote Baan to the junction with Verlengde Stallestraat. Turn right (west) and walk ≈250m to the traffic light under the motorway. Altogether the walk is ≈500m and takes five minutes.\n\nOr take tram 4 ([http://m.stib.be/line.php?lang=fr&line=4&iti=1 STIB]) till the terminus ([http://maps.google.be/maps?q=stalle+prolongee&hl=nl&ll=50.795375,4.318566&spn=0.000895,0.001725&sll=50.792373,4.316597&sspn=0.045358,0.110378&t=h&hnear=Verlengde+Stallestraat,+Vlaams-Brabant&z=19 Stalle]), then walk further towards the motorway along Rue Prolongée de Stalle/Verlengde Stallestraat (with some massive shops) till you reach the traffic lights underneath the motorway bridge. \n\nYou can also leave tram 4 at the stop Egide van Ophem (2 stops before terminus). Here you just need to cross the street and you\'ll find yourself on a DATS 24 petrol station. Depending on the time of the day (best is around evening rush hour, as people are leaving Brussels), it can be easy or very easy to get a ride to the Ruisbroek service station. Make sure to state very clearly where you want to go (Ruisbroek petrol station is on the “ring”) as many people go through it without knowing, for example if their destination is Waterloo.\n\n==== Option 2: Ruisbroek Petrol Station ====\n{{Coords|50.7776|4.2993}}\n\nTo get directly on the Ruisbroek Petrol Station (which is located on the western part of the ring), you need to take bus 50 (direction Lot station) from Brussels Midi Station to Ruisbroek Voetbalplein. This takes about half an hour. From here you walk straight and turn the second to the left (into Hemelstraat) and follow this till the end. Go left into Broekweg and follow your way onto the petrol station.\n\nAnother option is taking the local train from one of Brussels\' railway stations (e.g. Centrale or Midi) to Ruisbroeck for 2,40€ (ticket at the machine). From there you can also walk (allow 30 min).\n\nEIther way, you biggest obstacle ist the ditch around the rest station which you have to traverse. It usually filled with water and can be a slippery thing. However, there is/was a tree trunk placed in the ditch which you can use to get to the other side. It\'s close to the petrol station. If you cross here you will also find a hole in the fence where you can pass through.\n\n\n==== Option 3: Internationalelaan/Boulevard International ====\n{{Coords|50.8159|4.3041}}\n\nInternationalelaan/Boulevard International close to the motorway entrance. There is a lot of traffic and much space for cars to stop, even a petrol station where you could ask people directly. To get there, take bus 78 from the Brussels Zuidstation/Gare du Midi in direction of Humanité and get out at the stop Bollinckx. Attention! The bus only runs every hour. [http://www.stib.be/horaires-dienstregeling.html?l=fr Schedule] Keep in mind that you are now in the middle of an industrial zone!\n\n==== Option 4: E19 Motorway junction 17 (Ceria/Coovi) ====\n{{Coords|50.8135|4.2899}}\n\nAnother option to take metro yellow line 5 (direction Érasme/Erasmus) and get off at CERIA/COOVI. Walk Chaussée de Mons/Bergensesteenweg down south (you can ask people the direction of Ikea). Some 150 meters from the metro station you will see a bridge. Go down across the bridge, there you will see entrance (consisting of 3 lanes from 3 different directions) to the motorway in direction of Mons/Paris. 5 km further there will be a big Total petrol station called \'\'Ruisbroek\'\'{{Coords|50.778996609025434|4.300230143955976|1}}, there you will easily find a ride further to the south.\n\n==== Option 5: Delta (South-East) ====\nAlthough Delta is mostly known as the best spot to get to Louvain-la-Neuve then Namur and Luxembourg along the E411 (see below), it can very well be suited to get on the E19 (Nivelles, Charleroi or Mons, then Paris, or even Lille). Using a sign on this spot is mandatory as drivers are used to see hitchhikers going to Louvain-la-Neuve (E411 rather than E19). Unless your driver goes further, which is often the case, ask to be dropped at rest area of Nivelles 30 minutes from Brussels (the one with the Total petrol station and a restaurant that is built across the highway).\n\nThe spot has direct access from the exit no. 4 of metro station Delta on line 5 (15 minutes ride from the city center).\n\nVUB and ULB students or hitchhikers leaving from Ixelles have a reason to prefer this option as it will save them time compared to reaching Stalle stop (Drogenbos) by tram 4.\n\nAlternatively, you can ask drivers directly at the petrol station Lukoil (30 minutes on average). On the contrary, Texaco petrol station’s staff, on boulevard du Triomphe, has proven to be very unfriendly to hitchhikers once, threatening to call the cops.\n\n\n=== Southeast towards [[Louvain-la-Neuve]], [[Namur]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Lyon]], [[Strasbourg|Strasbourg]], [[Geneve]] {{E|411}} ===\nThe E411 to Luxembourg is a recommended direction to head further South. This option should probably also be considered to go the South if you want to avoid Paris.  Because petrol is a lot cheaper in Luxembourg you can easily find long rides at the petrol station in Luxembourg before the border.\n\n==== Option 1: Delta ====\n{{Coords|50.8175|4.4051}}\n\nOne of the historically well-known places by local hitchhikers, \'Delta is on the way towards Louvain-La-Neuve (student town) and is situated right at the exit no. 4 of metro station Delta (15 minutes from the centre), next to the Delta bus depot. To get there, take metro line 5 direction Herrmann-Debroux, or bus 71 to Delta. It is common to bump into one or two other (student) hitchhikers there. There\'s a petrol station (Lukoil) next to the metro station where you won\'t wait more than five minutes on a Sunday morning if you say you\'re a student.\n\nHistorical note: as [[Louvain-la-Neuve]] is a student town, and Delta is at the entrance of the motorway and next to the VUB/ULB (Brussels university), many students used to hitchhike that route.\n\n==== Option 2: Station Beaulieu in Ixelles ====\nTo get to metro station Beaulieu in Ixelles, take line 5 direction \'\'Herrmann-Debroux\'\'. You will notice many cars stopping at traffic lights just before the station. This road connects with the motorway towards the South. Some hitchhiker got a lift in less than 2 minutes. There is a big service station 10 minutes down the road if needed for further lifts.\n\n====Option 3: Demey====\nTake the metro to the station Demey and find a direct entrance to the highway right next to the station. There is a pavement, so you can hitchhike safely.\n\n=== South towards [[Waterloo]] N5 ===\nPublic transport to the site of Waterloo battlefield are deficient, so hitchhiking could be a solution for th ose who wish to do a day excursion to that historic site.  The best is to reach Ter Cameren Bos (Bois de la Cambre) at the border between Ixelles and Ukkel \'\'(Tram 94 - 23 - 24) and find a spot along the Chaussee de Waterloo\'\' {{Coords|50.811928|4.368154|1}} or by taking [http://maps.google.be/?ie=UTF8&ll=50.789497,4.374205&spn=0.000717,0.001725&t=h&z=19 Tram 92 till "Fort Jaco" terminus], and then walk to adjacent Chaussee de Waterloo to hh further south.\n\n=== Northeast or East, towards [[Leuven]], [[Antwerpen|Antwerp]], [[Liège|Liege]], [[Germany]], [[Netherlands]] {{E|40}} / {{E|314}} ===\n====Option 1====\nStart hitching at the entrance of the Tunnel located at the gate of the Jubelpark/Parc du Cinquentenaire on the Blijde-Inkomstlaan/Avenue de la Joyeuse-Entrée on the side of the \'Rond-Point Schuman\' (metro access 1A/1B direction Herrmann-Debroux/Stokkel). There is a street light and a side parking just at the entrance of the tunnel, you may simply stand by the light with a sign and the cars can immediately pull over to pick you. This hitching point is an easy start to go to Leuven or Liege or possibly reach the Heverlee services in Leuven on the E40 or on the E314.\n\n====Option 2==== \nAnother good option is to hitch at the red lights on the [http://maps.google.be/maps?f=q&hl=nl&geocode=&q=rue+du+belliard+10+,+bruxelles&sll=50.84508,4.369297&sspn=0.010351,0.026608&ie=UTF8&ll=50.844945,4.368825&spn=0.010704,0.026608&z=15&iwloc=addr Rue du Belliard]. It\'s a one way street with 4 lanes and most cars enter the tunnel at the end of the street that goes onto the motorway towards Leuven, Liege and Aachen. Make sure to ask your driver if they go onto the motorway and go towards Leuven. The first petrol station on the motorway is right after the exit to Leuven. If your driver goes to Leuven he can miss his turn and still go to the town through the petrol station. Nearby public transportation to this second hitching spot are Metro station "Trone/Troon" and also several bus lines.\n\n\n====Option 3==== \nGet to premetro Station "Diamant". You can get there by taking the metro to Schuman (Direction 1/5 Stockel/Hermann-Debroux) and change then to bus 79 (direction Kraainem) or take tram no. 25 from Rogier in direction of Boondaal Station/Gare Boondael. Cross "Bld. Auguste Reyers" in eastern direction. Then walk to the spot on the small street, just after the traffic lights, that leads to the A3-motorway. There is plenty of space for cars to pull over.\n\n====Option 4====\nThe best way to leave the city fast and in the right direction is going past the ring road. So, if you\'re ok to pay the public transport, take the [https://www.delijn.be/fr/lijnen/lijn/3/351/2 De Lijn bus 351] from the train station Brussels-North and stop at \'\'Nossegem - Centrum\'\' {{Coords|50.8744|4.4931|1}} (it takes 30 minutes and cost 3 euros). Walk a few metres in the direction of the bus and you reach a big crossroad where the highway is announced. Follow the sign and turn right to find a very comfortable point to hitchhike to Leuven or Liege\n\n====Option 5====\nStand by the roundabout next to the parking lot entrance to the Cora supermarket, in Woluwe. From the Roodebeek metro station, walk 15min or take bus 45 to Gulledelle.\n\n=== North towards [[Antwerpen|Antwerp]], [[Breda]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Utrecht]], [[Amsterdam]] A12 or {{E|19}} ===\n====Option 1==== \nTake tram 3, 19, or 23 and get off at \'\'De Wand\'\' or take tram 4 and get off at \'\'Esplanade\'\' (and then turn right). Walk along the Avenue de Meysse up to Antwerpselaan, crossing Romeinsesteenweg. By now you should see the signs for Antwerp. Keep following the signs for a couple more roads further on. This will increase your chances when you hitch on Antwerpselaan and try to catch a car that would get onto the motorway at junction 2 of the A12. De Lijn busstop "Strombeek-Bever Nieuwelaan" is good, cars are going slow and have place to stop. \n\n====Option 2==== \nTake metro 6 in the direction of \'\'Koning Boudewijn/Roi Baudoin\'\' and get off at \'\'Heysel\'\'. Take Keizerin Charlottelaan/Avenue Impératrice Charlotte to the right in the direction of Brussels Expo. Continue along Avenue de Miramar (so don\'t go to the atomium) and turn left at the end where you will see highway A12 in front of you. Take the next to the right and go under the bridge. Start hitchhiking just after the bridge at the street on your left (Antwerpselaan). \n\nIf you don\'t have any luck with finding a spot to stand you can try your chances at Brussels Airport. You can take bus 21 to the airport and then go to the "Départ" area. Go outside and you will see a lot of cars drive by and drop off people who are catching a plane. When you walk a bit into the direction where the cars are going to (it\'s one-way traffic) you will find a good spot where you can stand and where cars can stop for you. Use a sign, because probably most cars will move into Brussels and only a few will go to Antwerpen. This road will lead to the highway and also to the petrol station that is described at the section on Brussels Airport.\n\n\n====Option 3, NATO====\nThe [http://maps.google.com/?q=nato,+brussels&ie=UTF8&hq=nato,&hnear=Brussels,+Belgium&ll=50.877674,4.42263&spn=0.004008,0.009645&z=17&iwloc=lyrftr:m,0x47c3dcd1ea2536c7:0xe8a6c0992aa12ff7,50.877511,4.421042 bus stop in front of the NATO] is pretty good for hitchhiking further than Antwerp, although there is more traffic at the parallel traffic lights. For hitchhiking to Holland, make a sign for the Antwerp/E19 and get off at the petrol station just before Antwerp: lots of Dutch cars / people here to ask for a ride. If someone takes you to Mechelen though, make sure they drop you of at Mechelen Noord motorway exit. Buses 12, 21 and 65 go to the Nato stop. You can get the number 65 from the Madou metro stop.\n\n====Option 4, Airport====\nTake an overpriced train or for a more normal price bus 12 or 21 to Brussels International Airport. There are many exits at the airport. You can find one and start hitching from where cars pay their parking-ticket. A bit further down the road towards the motorway you\'ll find a Shell service station. Most cars here stay around the airport, but you may have luck. A final suggestion is to keep on walking along the side-road until it joins with the motorway. Cars go relatively slow here and there is plenty of room for a vehicle to pull over.\n\nIn order to get to the airport there are different options:<br>\nThe fast but expensive (8,5€) direct train to Brussels Airport from Bruxelles Midi, Central or Nord.<br>\nSTIB/MIVB bus #12 or #21 leaving from Place de Luxembourg (4€), be sure to check the timetable and keep the traffic jams during rush hour in mind<br>\nDe Lijn bus #272 or #471 leaving from Gare du Nord/Noordstation (normal ticket price around 2€)<br>\nTake a normal priced train to Zaventem Station and walk 2 km to the airport. When you leave the station, take the Vilvoordelaan straight till the second roundabout and follow the road to Brussels airport (there is a pedestrian road next to the highway).\n\n====Option 5, Notre Dame Cathedral / Laeken====\nA relatively good spot in the North-West of Brussels can be found around the corner of Parvis Notre Dame, the Cathedral of Laeken. You can reach this by metro L6 towards Koning Boudewijn and get off at Bockstael Metro station. Turn left when you exit and go through Rue Leopold I, or just follow the pedestrian street-signs for the Cathedral. Tram 94 also apparantly stops close to the cathedral (not confirmed). [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=bockstael&sll=50.879901,4.358912&sspn=0.006025,0.013797&ie=UTF8&ll=50.878632,4.356237&spn=0.000753,0.001725&t=h&z=19 map].\n\nIf your driver is not heading to your destination but goes to the ring, you can get out where the A12 starts. You will find some small spots around the roundabout that should work.

However, hitching from the ring road in some places can be very difficult, Especially in the north near Otopeni and motorway 1 where they are constructing a new road and it is a very bad area full of prostitutes, stray dogs, gypsies and really no good places for cars to stop. In such cases it is better to just hitch into town and avoid the ring road. Then take a metro or a bus to the side of Bucharest you need to exit from.\n\nSouthbound travelers headed for [[Bulgaria]] or [[Istanbul]] might want to stop at a truck rest stop [http://maps.google.com/?q=bucuresti&ie=UTF8&ll=44.435718,25.964658&spn=0.002896,0.006191&t=h&z=17&iwloc=addr close to where the E70 takes a right turn], where one can possibly find a lift straight there. Even if there are few drivers stopped in the parking lot that you can ask directly, you can thumb trucks driving by, preferably with a sign reading BG or TR. Traffic moves very slowly here so drivers have plenty of time to see you.\n\n\n== Hitchhiking out ==\n\n\n=== West towards [[Transylvania]], [[Serbia]] {{E|81}} ===\n\nGet the metro to \'\'Pacii\'\' (note the metro is a bit crazy - if you\'re not careful the trains change lines without warning and you can end up at \'\'Gare Du Nord\'\' again!). \nFrom \'\'Pacii\'\' you have to find the main road going west, and go to the first bus stop. Get the first bus that says \'\'Carrefour\'\' and go all the way to \'\'Carrefour\'\' shopping centre, this is the start of the motorway. Carrefour also provides free shuttle minibuses leaving from \'\'Pacii\'\' and even from further inside the city. There\'s a part where the fence is broken (it\'s not broken anymore, if you get to the mall, you have to walk back a little bit, and or a) walk by the side of the entrance of a tunnel (kind of dangerous) or b) get out before the carrefour and walk (and hitch) a kilometer or two) and you can access the motorway here - it\'s actually a very good spot to hitch, since traffic coming from the big shopping centre stops here.\n\nAnother easy option to get to the same hitchhiking spot is to go to the metro "Preciziei" and from there walk about 2.1 km or take bus 25 or 35 and then walk 1.2 km.\n\nThe Transylvanian road runs through [[Sibiu]] and [[Cluj-Napoca]]. This is the standard route for central  and western Transylvania, the other route through Brasov is a "scenic" journey that takes longer.\n\n\n=== South towards [[Giurgiu]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Turkey]] {{E|85}} ===\n\n[[File:Romania-erga on the way out of bucharest.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Erga hitchhiking to Bucharest]]\n\nTake the M2 metro in direction of \'\'Berceni\'\'. Get off at \'\'Eroi Revolutiei\'\' and look for the \'\'City Mall\'\', walk towards it and you will see that the road forks. Take the right fork, the road will be called \'\'Giurgiului\'\'. Just after the city mall, there\'s a tram ticket office. Get a ticket (1.3 Lei as of October 2009), and walk a bit more on the road to get to the tram stop. It\'s right in the middle of the road. Take tram #7 or #25 to the last stop. Then walk down the road for 5 minutes and you will reach a service station on the right hand. You can ask people here or stop cars passing on the main road.\n\n\n=== Northeast towards Urziceni, [[Buzau]], [[Braila]], [[Galaţi]] {{E|85}} ===\n\nTake the metro to Piaţa Obor, then from there take tram #21 north to the last stop. The tram will turn off the main road into its terminus station, but after getting out of the tram continue walking straight on the main road. You will come to a bridge after a large market called \'\'Europa\'\'. Hitchhiking here is possible, but you will have to compete with other people who are standing alongside the road to flag down minibuses. A better option is to continue walking north for about three kilometers until after the Bucharest ring road, where all cars going northeast are isolated. Note: Tram #21 also can be taken just in the historical centre \'\'near Piata Sf. Gheorghe\'\' {{Coords|44.4322716|26.102424|1}}\n\n\n=== East towards [[Constanţa]], [[Vama Veche]] {{Aro|2}} ===\n\nTake the red metro line to Anghel Saligny, the last stop in direction east. If you leave the station, you are right at the beginning of the motorway A2 in direction Constanţa.\n\n\n=== North towards [[Ploiesti]], [[Brasov]] ===\n\nTake bus nr. 783 towards Otopeni Airport (e.g. from Piata Unirii, Piata Romana or Piata Victoriei) and get off at the stop called \'Aleea Privighetorilor\'. You can hitchhike right at the busstop.  Note that this road is an old road towards Ploiesti and some kilometers to the east there is a (new) highway, but many people still use it to go to Ploiesti or further north. Plus this road goes through some villages and therefore cars are not driving very fast and have plenty of opportunities to stop.\n\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n\n\n\n{{Cities Romania}}\n\n[[Category:Romania]]\n[[Category:Route to Istanbul]]\n[[Category:E60]]\n[[Category:E68]]\n[[Category:E70]]\n[[Category:E81]]\n[[Category:E85]]'},

If you get from the highway onto the 5, walk or ask the driver to bring you 2km in direction of the city center (towards the M51). After you pass the M51 there will be a MOL petrol station. Behind the petrol station is the bus number 66. This one will go inside the city and will bring you to the next metro station, too.\n\n\n== Hitching out ==\n\nThese directions are for leaving the city centre. See [[Budapest Ferihegy international airport]] for hitching from there.\n\n\n=== Northwest towards [[Bratislava]], [[Vienna]] M1 {{E|60}} & Southwest towards [[Zagreb]] M7 {{E|71}}, Lake Balaton ===\n\n==== Option 1: Motorway service station M1/M7 (OMV) - \'\'\'Kelenföld\'\'\' ====\n\nThis petrol station is the most popular spot with hitchhikers in all of Budapest, many young people use it to go to Balaton.. It is at the very beginning of the motorway that splits after a few kms into motorways M1 and M7. Some cars stop here only for the McD, so positioning yourself somewhere at the exit and thumbing or holding a sign works well. Asking around at the gas station is even better, ignore the clerks telling you to thumb.\n\nThere is another petrol station around 200m down the road, but it gets so little traffic that it is not worth going there.\n\nWays to get there:\n\n# Take bus 8E from \'\'Keleti pályaudvar\'\' (Keleti train station) in the direction of Kelenföld vasútállomás M, (and change at BAH-csomópont for bus 139), or take bus 139 from \'\'Széll Kálmán tér\'\' in the direction of Gazdagréti tér, and get off at \'\'Nagyszeben út\'\' (not Nagyszeben tér!). Walk back 100m east in the direction the bus came from along Budaörsi út and you will see the OMV petrol station and McD on the right.\n\n# Take metro 4 from \'\'Keleti pályaudvar\'\' to the last stop \'\'Kelenföld vasútállomás\'\'. Walk through the underpass and up the steps in northwest direction. Continue along the footpath till you reach the main road Budaörsi út. Cross the main road and turn left and walk west for 250m along Budaörsi út till you reach the OMV petrol station / McD.\n\n\'\'\'Personal experiences\'\'\'\n\n\'\'A friend and I wanted to hitchhike to Vienna from here. Upon arriving, we encountered a couple of other hitchhikers going to Balaton. We found a single seat going to Vienna within 30 mins. Upon speaking to the other hitchhikers, I found them a ride within five minutes by asking at the gas station. Another hitchhiker arrived and together we found a ride to the Austrian border within an hour. - [[User:Rebew|Rebew]] (Aug. 2021)\'\'\n\n\'\'I was able to get a ride in under an hour going to directly to Vienna. It was early morning so there wasn\'t that much traffic (1 car every 2-3 minutes) but seems like a good spot. I think it\'s worth holding out for a ride across the border if you don\'t want to end up in Western Hungary somewhere. I had a sign saying "Wien" but the ride was from a Hungarian. - [[User:AloysiusDente|AloysiusDente]] (March 2024)\'\'\n\n==== Option 2: OMV petrol station BAH-csomópont ====\n\nTake bus 8E, 110, 112 from \'\'Keleti pályaudvar\'\', or 139, 140, 140A from \'\'Széll Kálmán tér\'\', in direction of Kelenföld vasútállomás M and get off at \'\'BAH-csomópont\'\'. Alternatively, trams 17 and 61 stop here. Also, you can walk ≈4.5km west from Keleti train station to the beginning of \'\'Budaörsi út\'\'.<br/ >\nThis place is relatively close to the center and there is a lot of traffic to the M1 and M7. It appears like this is the only option in the list that nobody has specifically spoken against. \n\n==== Option 3: Motorway service station M1/M7 (Agip) \'\'\'Budaörs\'\'\' ====\n\nTake metro 4 from \'\'Keleti pályaudvar\'\' to the last stop \'\'Kelenföld vasútállomás\'\'. Take bus 172 or 173 and get off at stop \'\'Budaörs, benzinkút\'\', which is right at the Agip service station. It has a lot of traffic to both motorways and can be a great place if you get a chance to talk to drivers, though the staff of the petrol station may not allow it. \n\n==== Option 4: Motorway service station M1 \'\'\'Biatorbagy\'\'\' ==== \n\nTake metro 4 from \'\'Keleti pályaudvar\'\' to the last stop \'\'Kelenföld vasútállomás\'\'. Then take a local train to \'\'Biatorbagy\'\' (it costs about EUR 1 (HUF 370)). From the station, turn right for 20m, and then right again at the roundabout under the railway tracks along Dózsa György út for ≈350m until you reach a main road. Turn left (northwest) and follow this national road 1 for 2km to a turning on the right. Walk north along this road for ≈750m under the motorway bridge to the service station on the north side of the motorway.If you are ready to invest some time to get to the first petrol station after the motorway splits, you should do so because it is a perfect spot as essentially all the cars there are going towards Vienna/Bratislava.\n\n==== Option 5: Various spots near the city centre ====\n\nStarting from inside the city (between Moszkva tér and Kelenföld) is a possibility worth trying, especially because there are some good spots that are quite popular among local hitchhikers. Pros are that you don\'t need to spend any money on transport; cons are that there is a lot of local traffic and so waiting times could be very long. (In real nobody will take you, go out to the edge of the city).\n\n=== South towards [[Szeged]], [[Serbia]], [[Arad]] ([[Romania]]) (M5) {{E|75}} ===\n\n==== Option 1: Gyáli út ====\n\nTake tram 4 or 6 to \'\'Boráros tér\'\', then take bus number 54 or 55 to the stop \'\'Gyáli út\'\'. Walk straight for 75 m and then turn left on the street \'\'Gyáli út\'\'. After about 150 m there is a curve in the road, turn right there and walk to the motorway (it\'s not yet a motorway officially, so you can hitchhike there). There is no road or pavement leading there, but it\'s easy to cross. You will see a half complete ramp on your right going on the motorway. It\'s basicaly a 100 meters long lane with no traffic on it, it\'s ideal for cars to stop, and you are also visible from a long distance. As of January 2017, there is some construction which leaves no space for stopping except on the exit lane of the petrol station nearby. The spot still worked quite well\n\n==== Option 2: Petrol Station OMV on Nagykőrösi út ====\n\nTake tram 4 or 6 to \'\'Boráros tér\'\', then take bus 54 or 55 to the stop \'\'Radnó utca\'\'. There is a petrol station on the other side of the noise barrier wall. You could also thumb at the bus stop on the bus-only lane. If you want to go any further, option 3 is about 800 meters down the road.\n\n\'\'I got a ride to a rest station near Kecskemét within 30 minutes. My driver told me that thumbing at the bus station would\'ve been a better idea. Kecskemét was good to hitchhike, but the tourists are annoying. This is also a perfect route to go to Kosovo, as 90% of drivers will be going there. - Rebew (30/07/2021)\'\'\n\n==== Option 3: Start of M5 motorway ====\n\nTake the metro to \'\'Határ út\'\'. Then take bus [http://www.bkv.hu/busz/84e.html #84E], [http://www.bkv.hu/busz/89e.html #89E] or [http://www.bkv.hu/busz/294e.html #294E] to the stop \'\'Naszód utca (Használtcikk piac)\'\'. Here you can start to hitch (you should see a Citroen car lot on the other side of the road. A sign "Szeged" is useful. If you take bus 84E, you can continue straight onto the motorway to a OMV petrol station that you can hitch from. (This information is unconfirmed; maybe this is the OMV in option 2.)\n\n==== Option 4: Motorway service station M5 Inárcs ====\n\nTake the metro 3 to \'\'Népliget\'\'. Take bus [http://www.volanbusz.hu/en/timetable/lines/line/?menetrend=2204 Volánbusz 608] to \'\'Inárcsi elág (M5-ös út)\'\'. After approximately 30km, it will leave the motorway and go to Inárcs. Remember the way and get off the bus at the first stop (shortly past where the town starts) and walk back to the OMV petrol station where the bus left the motorway. Take care, because there is no sidewalk and cars/trucks can be quite fast. It is the first big petrol station on M5 after Budapest [{{Coords|47.2750|19.3289}}] and there will be cars and trucks to all the southerly destinations - just ask around. You can look for foreign plates if you want to leave the country.\n\n=== South towards [[Érd]], [[Pécs]] (6, M6) {{European Route Number|73}} ===\n\nTake tram 61 from near train station \'\'Déli Pályaudvar\'\', or tram 6 from \'\'Blaha Lujza tér.\'\', or bus 7 from \'\'Ferenciek tere\'\', to \'\'Móricz Zsigmond körtér\'\'. From here, cross the street and walk on for about 20m. Take bus 33 or 33A and get off at \'\'Budatétényi Sorompó\'\' (the stop after the big shopping mall Campona on your left). From the bus stop, turn back and walk in the direction the bus just came from. Cross the street at the first crossing to your right (Növény ut.). That street has a railway overpass that crosses over it. Walk under the overpass and in a couple of minutes you\'ll arrive at a busy road. This is road #6 that goes south to Pécs. Turn left on that road and start hitching before the traffic light near the bus stop. There is enough room for cars to pull over there.\n\nIf you take bus 33, you can go until the last stop (\'\'Nagytétény, Chinoin\'\'). Walk forward (east) for 200 m and then turn left to the ramp which leads you to a roundabout. There is an entry to the M6 here where you can thumb.\n\nFor food, bathroom, and buses, get dropped of at the Tesco in Pécs. There\'s a bus station there where cars can stop.\n\n\n=== East towards [[Miskolc]], [[Košice]] ([[Slovakia]]), [[Ukraine]] (M3) {{European Route Number|71}} ===\n\n==== Option 1: Junction & Petrol station on M3 bevezető ====\n\nTake trolleybus [http://www.bkk.hu/en/timetables/#74 74] from \'\'Károly körút (Astoria M)\'\' near Astoria metro station. Get off at \'\'Sárrét park\'\'. Turn back in the direction from where the trolleybus came from and walk ≈50m along Ungvár ut. Turn right and walk 200m along Rákosszeg park to the end. Turn right on Kacsóh Pongrác út. and walk 100m to the entrance slip road, or turn left on Kacsóh Pongrác út. and walk 50m to the OMV petrol station.\n\n==== Option 2: M3 Junction ==== \n\nTake bus 7, 7E, 8E, 108E, or 133E from \'\'Blaha Lujza tér\'\' and get off at the last stop \'\'Újpalota, Nyírpalota út\'\'. Walk northwest 1km along Szentmihályi út. to the sliproad at the beginning of the M3 proper. It\'s not the best hitchhiking spot, but it works after a while. If you get stuck here, walk 2km along the motorway to the service station.\n\n==== Option 3: M3 Junction Mogyoród ====\n\nTake metro 2 to the last stop \'\'Örs Vezér tér\'\'. From the HÉV (regional train station), take train 8 in the direction \'Gödöllő\' and get off at \'\'Mogyoród\'\'. From the station, walk left 20m on Vasút ut. Turn right and walk ≈400m along Gödöllői ut. Then turn right and walk ≈500m along Szadai út. until you reach the entrance sliproad to the M3 motorway on the right. Alternatively, two kilometres further on, there is also a petrol station on the motorway.\n\n==== Option 4: Motorway service station M3 ====\nTake bus 5 from \'\'Blaha Lujza tér\'\' in the direction of Rákospalota, Kossuth utca and get off at \'\'Juhos utca\'\'. Walk ≈450m northeast along Régi Fóti út. You will see a Lidl supermarket on the right. Turn right on the small road and walk southeast for 1km crossing over the motorway bridge. (You can see the service station on the left from the bridge). Take the first road left after the bridge and walk ≈700m until you see the big Praktiker store. Turn left and walk through the car park to the end and jump over the small-ish fence and once past the road, you will be on the petrol station. There is a McDonalds and KFC here too.\n\n\'\'\'\'\'\'Option 5:\'\'\'\'\'\' Kacsóh Pongrác út bus station\'\'\'\'\'\' \n\nTake M1 to Mexikói út metro station and cross the railways in the underpass to the Róbert Károly körút where you will find Kacsóh Pongrác út bus station. It\'s a very safe place to stop and it is directly before the entrance to the M3 highway. (Waiting time as a woman 10-15 min, hichhiked many times here)\n\n\n=== East towards [[Szolnok]], [[Debrecen]], [[Oradea]] ([[Romania]]) {{European Route Number|60}}, (4) ===\n\n==== Option 1: Agip petrol station on national road 4 ====\n\nTake metro 3 to the end of the line at \'\'Kőbánya-Kispest\'\'. Walk to the bus station on the other side of the #4 road. Take the airport bus 200E and get off at the second to last stop before the airport: \'\'Vecsés-nyugat\'\'. Walk back along the road ≈600m and you will reach the Agip petrol station & McDonalds.<br/ >\n\n==== Option 2: Üllő roundabout & MOL petrol station ====\n\nTake a regional train from train station \'\'Nyugati Pályaudvar\'\' to \'\'Üllő\'\' (550 HUF and 30 min ride). Walk ≈700m southwest on Deák Ferenc ut. till you reach the main road through the town Pesti út. Turn left (southeast) here and walk 2km along Pesti út to the large roundabout and MOL petrol station at the end of town. You can also hitch 100m past the roundabout on national road 4; although there\'s no shoulder, there is some space for cars to pull over and stop. 20/09/17 Tried option 1 for 3 hours and then went to option 2, waited maybe 30min.\n\n=== Option 3:  M3 Highway for Debrecen ===\n\nTake a subway till station Mexicói út after walk 4 km ( it\'s pretty far and I saw a bus  25, but didn\'t check from where is it going ) till you cross Ozman utca( or around it) it will be a gas station OMV, the road is going among M3 highway, and here some cars are going to a gas station from Highway to this road and back to the highway, and also there is a bus stop after a gas station, where is very convenient to stop the car.\n\n\n=== North towards [[Slovakia]], [[Kraków]] ([[Poland]]) M2 {{European Route Number|77}} ===\n\n[[File:vacifoti.jpg|thumb|right|220 px| The bus stop at the Váci-Fóti intersection]]\n\n==== Option 1: Motorway Junction Sződliget ====\n\nTake a train from \'\'Nyugati Pályaudvar\'\' in the direction of Vac and and get off at \'\'Sződliget\'\' (HUF 550/EUR 2 and 30 min ride). Walk south along the platform to the road (Dunai fasor). Turn left (east) and walk ≈400m to the entrance sliiproad over the motorway bridge. Stand on the motorway hitchhiking instead of the sliproad as there\'s a lot of space to pull over and people don\'t really drive too fast at that stretch of the road. \n\n==== Option 2: Motorway service station (Shell) ====\n\nTake a train from \'\'Nyugati Pályaudvar\'\' to "Dunakeszi Gyártelep\u200e" (HUF 150/300) and walk 3.5 km to the petrol station on the E77 (Hungarians call it Road Number Two). The walk is 40+ minutes but its pretty straightforward - check this [http://goo.gl/maps/bCKPV map]. From Pipa st. you can see the sign of the petrol station in the distance, and it will help you to navigate.\n\nThe motorway only has two lanes and cars are going pretty slow, so it\'s not a problem to cross it. Once you get there its great spot to catch a long drive! You can be picky, so best wait for someone going straight to Poland because once you get to the Slovak border, the road is getting bad and this is your best shot. \n\nIf you\'re heading to [[Poland]], you\'d most likely be better off finding a direct lift to Poland from the Hungarian- Slovak border rather than getting short lifts through Slovakia. Trucks go until the Chyzne border crossing between Slovakia and Poland, where it\'s easy to get a lift to Krakow or further to Warsaw.\n\n\n== Public Transport ==\n\nBudapest has an extensive public transportation system consisting of a metro, buses and trams. A single ticket is about 1.15 (a set of 10 tickets is about EUR 9.90). After you buy your ticket, you have to validate it. There are red machines on buses and trams that punch a hole in a different place on your ticket each day, which is how they determine if you validated your ticket that day (or at least not the day before...). \n\nInspections on buses and trams are rare except for the most popular lines (e.g. buses 7, 7E, 173 and 173E and trams 2 (very frequent), 4 and 6). Rush hours are usually safe when the trams/buses are too crowded for the inspectors to walk through the vehicles. If you want to be safe, hang around the machine and if you see an inspector coming, punch your ticket immediately. You can usually also get off the carriage when you see inspectors getting on as usually at least some of them will wear uniforms. \n\nBe careful: the system has changed, and the controllers are often escorted with a public area inspector who has the right to stop you and demand for your ID cards.\'\n\nIn the metro there are inspectors posted at the entrance to the platforms during all operational hours who will demand to see your ticket. Most of the time they check those who are entering and don\'t bother with people who are leaving the platform (Keleti railway station is one notable exception), so if you see no conductors at the entrance then you are fine. Either you take your chance that there will be no checking at the exit, or take the bus/tram, you can get pretty much everywhere without the metro. Oftentimes you can also just walk past these inspectors at the entrance or flash them a used ticket without stopping. Be careful changing lines at Deák Ferenc tér, usually there are controllers on stations of Line 2 and 3. \n\nIf you get caught without a valid ticket, the official fine on the spot is HUF 8,000, which is about EUR 27. Do not let yourself be fooled with another amount, it is HUF 8,000, and the received paper is valid for travelling that day. But if you are cool enough you can get away without paying at all. On the trams and buses the inspectors legally aren\'t allowed to touch you. Avoid speaking English or German to the controllers. Instead, pick the most obscure language you know and keep them busy until the next stop. When the doors open, simply exit the tram and walk away. Never give the controllers your ID or passport. Maybe try searching for it or your ticket until the next stop, then get off the tram/bus then. Some of the controllers will try to take you to a cash machine if you say you have no money. Same system applies - simply walk away from the controller. I\'ve also heard of people stalling the controller for so long that the controller gets bored and walks away.\n\nAt around 20:30 or later, the ticket inspectors that stand at the entrance to the metro go home, meaning you can get on the metro for free. Be aware also that if they have controls while you exit the station, they announce it as you get off the train and again every 2 minutes or so ("Please have your tickets ready for inspection as you leave the station.") If this happens, simply get back on the next train and get off a stop before or after your chosen stop. Do not try and run past any inspectors if they have a control -- they are notoriously aggressive and will have no problem chasing you.\n\nOn the green line there are security guards stationed on the platforms, but don\'t worry, they won\'t check your tickets. They\'re just a security precaution. The same thing applies on tram 4 or 6 at night (they run 24 hours). They will stand at some entrances to the tram and check peoples\' tickets as they enter the tram (They\'ll be wearing either a yellow vest or a green armband.) Choose a different entrance and you\'ll be fine, because the controllers stand at one door and don\'t move through the tram.\n\nFor finding connections between two points in the city, there\'s a very good route planner available also in English: [http://www.bkk.hu/en/timetables/ http://www.bkk.hu/en ]\n\nThere is a [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0373981/ very good Hungarian movie] about the controllers on Budapest\'s public transportation. Finding English subtitles is easy, too.\n\n\n== Sleeping  ==\n\nIf you want to sleep outside in summer, you can do so anywhere in Buda hills. These places are abandoned after dark, far from people, and sometimes used by homeless people. \n\nIn case the weather outside is not very warm nor welcoming, the mall Duna Plaza, in the northern part of the city XIII district, metro stop Gyongyosi utza offer great opportunities to find a shelter and not being discovered by security guards. In a cold night of november I found a perfect spot to lay down on his mat and sleep, behind the high bar of a closed (but open..) pub on the 2nd floor, next to the restaurants, emergency exit stairs on the back, at the highest floors are also a good option. Toilets are closed at night and security go around to check when they close the building around 02:00.\n\nAnother safe option for the winter time would be the \'\'\'airport\'\'\' - unfortunately you can’t blackride the bus that goes there since the driver checks everyone, but the combined ticket for the Metro and the bus is 530 HUF (~1,15€). If you buy the ticket from the driver instad of the vending machine, it’s 600 HUF. The staff doesn’t care about the people sleeping there and no one checks if you have a flight ticket. Might also be a good option if you’re planning on hitchhiking from there in the morning.\n\n== Food ==\n\nAt Allee shopping centre (metro stop Újbuda Központ, green line. Tram 4 and 6 too) on the top floor there is a large food court where it\'s possible to table dive. Also at Kőbánya Kispest (last stop on the M3 blue line) there is a large shopping centre beside the train station. There\'s a large food court on the top floor also where you can table dive. \nAlso in the Corvin Plaza there\'s a food court on the top floor to table dive.\n\nTry the market at Újbuda Központ (Vásárlócsarnok) and you can maybe get some free vegetables from the sellers there.\n\nAt Örs vezér tere, there\'s an IKEA with a great food court. Just take a left after you come up the stairs to avoid all the showrooms unless you enjoy playing there to raise your appetite :-) \n\nOn the top floor of the central market at Fovam ter, there are many food stalls, popular among tourists, most of whom are ignorant fuckers who order what they want but not what they need, i.e. A LOT of leftovers on the table. There are public tables where these fuckers eat and they are not frequently cleaned by workers, thus easy opportunity for table diving. Please do this, even just once or twice. I have seen big sandwiches and baked potatoes and such being left after a single bite. We should make wasting food a crime.\n\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n\n\n\n{{Excellent}}\n{{IsIn|Hungary}}\n\n[[Category:Hungary]]\n[[Category:E60]]\n[[Category:E75]]\n[[Category:E71]]\n[[Category:E77]]\n\n[[de:Budapest]]\n[[fr:Budapest]]\n[[ru:Будапешт]]'},

 'Cochabamba': {'text': '\'\'\'{{FULLPAGENAME}}\'\'\' is a city and municipality in central [[Bolivia]], in a valley in the Andes mountain range. It is the capital of the Cochabamba Department and is the fourth largest city in Bolivia.\n\n== Hitchhiking out ==\n\n=== West towards [[La Paz]], Southwest towards [[Oruro]], [[Chile]] ===\nTo get out of Cochabamba and the nearby town of  Quillacollo first take any trufi (minibus) - 204, 205, 206, 208, 209, 250, 260, 261, 270 amongst others - from Cochabamba to Plaza Bolívar en Quillacollo (2,50BS/0,31€). From here find trufi 261 going towards Suticollo (2,50BS/0,31€) (You can find it on the far corner of the square in the needed direction - this is its first stop, because there also goes the city trufi 261, which does not suit you). Usually there is a sign "Tranca Suticollo" on the right trufi. Tell the driver that would like to get off at the toll booth (tranca) ({{Coords|-17.47149|-66.33888}}) on the main road (F4). You can start hitching right after the toll booth and also talk to plenty of trucks.\n\n=== South East towards [[Sucre]] ===\nFrom this place approximately {{Coords|-17.406345|-66.153442}}, get a minibus going to Uspha Uspha for 1.5 Bs (now 2Bs in 2023). The name is not written on the buses but you can ask and they will tell you.\nYou can then walk until the toll station or just stay next to the road and get a lift (usually just walking along the road while sticking out your thumb should work). Leave early, the truck drivers do.\nStudy your names on the map before as you may accept a car ride going to the south road (to Tarata or Cliza) and may lose some time there until Punata (although it\'s manageable and not unpleasant).\n\n=== South East towards [[Toro Toro]] ===\nProceeding the same way, you can hitch a ride until Tarata and from there try to go to Toro Toro to visit the national park, cave, canyon...\nThe road is much less used and it can be hard to find someone but if you\'re lucky and patient you will. Or you can take a minibus from Cochabamba for 35 Bs. and try to hitchhike on the way back.\nThe national park is expensive (100 Bs., you would have to go by yourself at the office in the village to pay) and they won\'t let you enter in any place during the day without guides (which are also expensive).\n\n=== East towards [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]] ===\n\nRuta 4 runs east-west across the length of Cochabamba Valley and is the primary route eastward and descending to the lowlands of the department of Santa Cruz.\xa0 Continuing east from the city of Cochabamba it remains heavily urbanised for a further dozen kilometres, first passing through the city of Sacaba, the second largest in Cochabamba Department.\n\nThere is a tollbooth before Sacaba (search Peaje Huayllani) but it is still so deep in the urban fabric, on the busiest highway in the department between its two largest cities, that it really doesn’t make much sense to hitch there.\xa0\n\nSimilarly, while there are gas stations along the route through this area your chances of getting a ride at any of them are no better than in any such urban setting. There are three gas stations past Sacaba where it would be better to try your luck: ES Villa Obrajes, ES Trans Sacaba, and Surtidor Chiñata. All are on Ruta 4 and it’s around two kilometres walking from first to third. All three get traffic from truckers, assuming there is gasoline to pump, and if there’s no gasoline they line up and wait, making asking even easier.\n\nTo get there from central Cochabamba you can grab a Trufi, of course. According to Trufi App, the 212 runs from La Cancha central market along Aroma, up Oquendo, and then turns northeast on Aniceto Arce to pass the narrow beneath the Cristo de la Concordia toward Sacaba and out to the above gas stations. \n\nOJO: There are MANY different routes that operate under the number 212, and not all go as far as these gas stations. The town nearest just beyond them is Catachilla, which can be used as a further reference point when asking if they make it that far. The Trufi App lists many of the different routes when searching by the route number 212, but not all trufis use standardised names and descriptions. [[User:Movethathoof|Movethathoof]] did not realize this and ended up at the end of a road parallel to Ruta 4 but way up the slope of the northern foothills. He ended up taking another Trufi to the entrance of Sacaba, and from there found another, with a different number, that got him the rest of the way.\n\nJust beyond the third gas station, Surtidor Chiñata, there is a traffic light where you can also hitch (also a good alternative if the gas stations have run dry). That\'s where [[User:Movethathoof|Movethathoof]] ended up getting his ride, almost as soon as he stuck out his thumb, right to Santa Cruz. The first tollbooth of any real use (appearing as \'Puesto de Control y Peaje - Aguirre\' in Google Maps) is still another 25 kilometres ahead, by which point you\'ve probably got a ride already, though it could be useful to trade up to a longer one.\n\n== Trufis ==\nThe \'\'combi\'\' public transport vans that are ever present are known as trufis, and generally there\'s one going wherever you could possibly need. On the highway it\'s easy enough to flag one down and ask, but their endless flow in the city makes that more complicated. Luckily, there is an [https://trufi.app/| app] (available on both Android and iOS) with lots of information on routes and potential schedules of the trufis serving the Cochabamba area. Click the preceding link or search "Trufi" in the appropriate app store and it should show up, the icon self-evident, the images confirming it\'s for Cochabamba.\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n{{IsIn|Bolivia}}\n{{Category|Bolivia}}\n{{Category|City\'s}}'},

But I digress.\'\'\n\n====Option 2====\nAnother option to catch an even longer distance ride is to take the Fox Street (AKA Park Ave west/23rd St.) entrance ramp to {{US-I|25}} north. There is a hotel and large gas station before this ramp which assures a solid amount of long distance traffic. \'\'In April 2016 I was at this spot, the entrance ramp did not work out after 45 minutes. At the gas station I found a ride in 20 minutes by asking people. One guy even bought me a coffee. The shopowner did not like me hanging around there and asked me to leave within 30 minutes.\'\'\n\n====Option 3====\nArriving at Union Stion in Downtown Denver a very good option going north is to walk to 20th street and stand on the side of the bridge over South Plate River to stop cars getting on {{US-I|25}} North. \'\'September 2019 I got a ride after 30 minutes in the sun all the way to Downtown Boulder from there. There is another on-ramp accessible by foot from Denver Uniton Station: Walk to Speer Blvd and try your luck. September 2019 I stood there for 20 minutes and then gave up as cars have no good place to stop there. I then walked to the other in my opinion way better spot near 20th street.\'\'\n\n=== West Into the Mountains ===\nThere is a gas station off of the Morrison exit on {{StateHighway|Colorado|470}} if you seek to go to Evergreen or Conifer. Great little towns. \nThere are park and ride spots near most of the {{US-I|70}} exits near the foothills that are in frequent use. Try hitching from there. Or take {{US-R|6}} West from the {{US-R|6}}/{{StateHighway|Colorado|93}} intersection in Golden.\n\n=== East Towards [[Kansas]] ===\nThese directions will get you to an EBD ramp, however I had no luck here, and after about 2 hours of shiny SUV\'s passing me, I gave up, but for informational puroposes: Take the bus  "airport blvd park-n-ride" - #43.  I think a few others go out there as well.  You can ride it to the end of the line, which is the Walmart shopping center, or the park-n-ride. Both stops are walking distance to {{US-I|70}}.  The ramp is nice and big, might just take you a while to get a lift though considering the demographics of the area, but it\'ll get you on your way.\n\n\' \' bailamoooos started at a truck stop on Rt 70 West just outside Denver and got a ride with a trucker straight to Salina, Kansas after a 30 minute wait. I was also offered a ride to Dallas by a trucker. Salina has a truckstop, a motel, and a campground within 50 yards of the highway.\' \'\n\n=== South Towards [[Colorado Springs]] ===\nTraveling South out of Denver can be difficult at best. RidgeGate Parkway (where Cabella\'s is located) is the last accessible onramp heading South (by bus) and not hitchhiker-friendly. 1 exit to the North is Lincoln, which has a decent pullover area. However, the entire area is brand-new and the expensive SUV\'s are far more likely to give you cash than a ride. Consider Greyhound to Colorado Springs if you\'re in a hurry. If you don\'t mind waiting a day or two for a ride, food & money can be easily gotten in the area and there are still plenty of fields to camp in. The library does have an upstairs family bathroom to get cleaned up in and the hotel has free breakfast.\n\nIf possible, a ride to the truck stop on Baptist Road in Monument (just North of Colorado Springs) is an excellent hitch spot, making it easy to get a ride to Albuquerque and beyond. Otherwise, expect long waits and short rides into New Mexico.\n\nNOTE: This is my second time hitching from this spot (Lincoln Ave. in Denver). The last time I waited 3 days before a sympathetic pastor finally stopped and bought me a bus ticket to Houston after seeing me there for so long. - jsplts\n\n\n[[Image:32390723 1774434692602485 6689973486976237568 n.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Kspar dutifully flagging down rides along i25 in Castle Rock, CO]]\n\nmay 2018: denver to austin, tx was our plan. friends dropped us off at an on-ramp(esque) just near W Plum Creek Pkwy {{Coords|39.364478|-104.866916}} in castle rock; 40 minute wait led us to hop over i25 to S Wilcox St (39.364620, -104.863877) which leads to i25. not ideal, but a bee keeper from CO springs snatched us up maybe 10 minutes later. from there, short rides got us to Monument, CO Springs, Fountain, Pueblo, CO City, Walsenburg, Trinidad and Raton, NM. probably my slowest hitching experience! not much through traffic in that area, but wait til you get further south of the larger cities. made up for it when we caught a lucky 10 hour ride to our doorstep in austin with three very texan men heading home from a christian conference in the rockies. praise the lord! [two_string_sally]\n\n== Public Transport ==\nLight rail has various stops from the city center going south. Market St and 16th St has a major bus hub. Good to get you anywhere in the greater Denver area\n\n== Places to Avoid ==\n\nParts of downtown Denver, including the section of East Colfax between Broadway and Colorado Boulevard, and also the Five Points neighborhood northeast of the capital, are often considered by residents to be the most dangerous areas of the city. Opinions differ as to whether or not the reputation is deserved. Although at one point in the not so recent past areas such as Five Points had a high rate of poverty and crime, during the past decade getrification has generally reduced concerns for personal safety when visiting that area or almost any part of the city of Denver, at least for those familiar with seedier areas in large cities.\n\n"Yeah I got dropped off in this truck stop past midnight. The trucker gave me his shower token and I washed off, then asked the workers which way to downtown - and both of them, this young girl and young guy, freaked and were like "Do nooot go walkin in this neighborhood at night!" and I was like "Cmon guys can\'t be that bad." They were tellin me about all the shady people, and me being dumb, thinkin I was all tough after homelessing around South Central LA and stuff, go walkin. The people are shady sure but, in those bad no-cop neighborhoods, people let their dogs wander around like in small-towns, but these are city dogs. Anyway, anywhere downtown is fine. Anywho I love, love, love Denver, it\'s my soul\'s home, I stop by Denver every time I travel"\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n{{IsIn|Colorado}}\n[[Category:City\'s]]\n[[Category:Colorado]]'},

Westbound lane is north of the viaduct, eastbound lane starts south of the viaduct. The on-ramps are not so great, so as an alternative you can try the BP gas station just before (you pass it with the bus).\n\n=== East towards [[Enschede]], [[Osnabrück]], [[Berlin]] ===\n{{Coords|52.2345|6.2146}}<br>\nYou can either follow the above advice and go to the eastbound on-ramp, or get to a much better on-ramp with a bit longer bus ride and a bit more walking. Get bus '''6''' to Colmschate-Zuid and get off at stop ''Hondsroos''. Walk south along the road, eastbound lane is south of the viaduct and has a nice hard shoulder.\n\n=== North towards [[Zwolle]] {{Nnl|337}} ===\n{{Coords|52.2743|6.1369}}<br>\nTake bus '''2''' or '''3''' and ride it all the way till the end, busstop ''Platvoet''. Walk around 100m in western direction to the roundabout and turn right. The place to stand is where the parallel road and main road connect, just after the roundabout and literally opposite restaurant ''De Zomertuin''. \n\n=== South towards [[Zutphen]] ===\n\n====Option 1====\n{{Coords|52.2262|6.1923}}<br>\nTake bus '''56''' (Zutphen) or '''81''' (Borculo) and get off at ''De Pessink''. Hitch from the bus stop on the {{Nnl|348}}. Traffic can be quite fast here, not a very good spot.\n\n====Option 2====\n{{Coords|52.2460|6.1429}}<br>\nThe alternative, more fun route. From the city center, walk across the ''Wilhelminabrug'', the big bridge over the river. Continue walking untill the crossing of the {{Nnl|344}} and {{Nnl|790}}. Hitch right from the beginning of the {{Nnl|790}}. The whole walk is around 2,5km.\n\n====Option 3====\n{{Coords|52.2518|6.1641}}<br>\nIf you hate walking try the spot at the roundabout called ''Emmaplein'', next to the ''Boreel'' shopping centre. Most traffic from here goes in the direction of [[Twello]] and [[Apeldoorn]], so you'll probably have to get out at the intersection of the {{Nnl|344}} and {{Nnl|790}} (see option 2), but then you've saved yourself the walk!\n\nEvery village you'll pass on the way will have good spots to hitchhike from, where traffic is slow.

There is a carpool parking where you can try to ask people for a ride. \n\n==== Option 2a ==== \n{{Coords|51.950|6.274}}<br>\nTake bus 24 to ''Woonboulevard''. Walk 300meter and cross the ''Europaweg''. Now turn right to the TinQ petrol station. There is no paved sidewalk, but a grassy path along the ditch. The entrance to the petrol station is an easy place for passing drivers to pull over.\n\n==== Option 2b ====\n{{Coords|51.9620|6.2795}}<br>\n This location is untested by the author.\nAnother gas station on ''Europaweg''. Easier to reach on foot from the centre, but probably less people going on the highway. There is a pedestrian entrance at the back leading to a foot path, so no offroading necessary. \n\n=== East towards [[Varsseveld]], [[Enschede]]  ===\n{{Coords|51.967|6.325}}<br>\n500m outside the city on the Varsseveldseweg is an old windmill, ''Benninkmolen''. There is a small parking bay where drivers can stop. Although it's a local road many people use it to get on the {{Nnl|18}} near Varsseveld. Almost every driver can take you to Varsseveld and many go as far as [[Enschede]] or [[Hengelo]]. \n\n=== South towards [[Emmerich am Rhein|Emmerich]] {{Ade|3}} by {{Nnl|316}} ===\n==== Option 1 ====\n{{Coords|51.950|6.274}}<br>\nSame as before, the petrol station on ''Europaweg''. People will asume you want to go on the highway so use a sign ''Emmerich'' or ''DLD''.\n\n==== Option 2 ====\n{{Coords|51.8622|6.2430}}<br>\nAlternatively, take bus 24 all the way to [['s Heerenberg]], and from the bus station walk 25 minutes to the onramp of the {{Ade|3}}. \nThere also is a petrol station 500meter further up the road, but this is mainly used by Dutch drivers pumping cheaper German fuel, who don't enter the highway.  \n\nWhen traffic is busy drivers might not stop at the onramp because there isn't a lot of space. Therefore it might be best to take the first ride that can take you 15km further, to the onramp at [[Isselburg]]. There is a wider onramp here. \n\n===West towards [[Doesburg]] and {{Anl|348}}, North towards [[Zutphen]]===\n{{Coords|51.972|6.277}}<br>\nEither use the bus stop on ''Keppelseweg'', or walk 300 meters further past the traffic lights and stand at the exit of ''Prins Alexanderstraat''. When trying to go to Doesburg, but your driver goes to Zutphen ask them to take a small detour to drop you in [[Laag Keppel]]. The bus stop there is very good.\n\n=== North towards [[Zelhem]], [[Ruurlo]] {{Nnl|315}}===\n{{Coords|51.964|6.315}}<br>\n''Fieten Olie'' petrol station on ''Oostelijke Randweg''. It's not really accessible for pedestrians but you can cross the street from the bicycle path on the other side.

 'Dresden': {'text': '\n{{Hitchhiking Zine nomination}}\n{{Infobox German Location\n|country = Germany\n|map = <map lat=\'51.049\' lng=\'13.74\' zoom=\'11\'/>\n|pop = 508,351 <small>(31/12/2007)</small>\n|state = Saxony\n|plate = DD\n|motorways = {{Autobahn|4}},  {{Autobahn|13}},  {{Autobahn|14}},  {{Autobahn|17}}\n}}\n\n\'\'\'Dresden\'\'\' is a city in the Eastern part of [[Germany]]. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden_Elbe_Valley \'\'Dresden Elbe Valley\'\'], a former World Heritage Site, is located on its outskirts.\n\n== General remarks ==\nDue to the specific positioning of motorway [[petrol station hitchhiking|petrol stations]] around Dresden, passing this city from the North to the South (and vice versa) could be (but not necessarily) rather difficult.\n\n== Hitchhiking out ==\n\n=== North towards [[Berlin]], [[Cottbus]] ({{Autobahn|13}}) and East towards [[Poland]] ===\n\n\n==== Option 1 - Hansastraße ====\n{{Coords|51.0797458759402|13.7395338714123}}\n{{Coords|51.08410914850553|13.739014863967897}}\n\nA great place for direction north and east is \'\'Hansastraße\'\'. You can either take tram line 13 and get off at \'\'Friedensstraße\'\' or if you are in \'\'Neustadt\'\', you can also walk from Alaunpark along \'\'Bischofsweg\'\' and \'\'Fritz-Reuter-Straße\'\' in direction west and you will pass the \'\'Friedensstraße\'\' tram stop as well.\nWalk down \'\'Hansastraße\'\' and you will pass 2 petrol stations. Both are good for asking people or to wave a sign. The first is generally better and you may meet some other hitchers. Hitching with thumb only is not recommended as cars are going in all directions.\n* If you are going to Berlin, just make a sign saying \'\'Berlin\'\', you will probably get a straight lift from here or at least to Freienhufener where it\'s very easy to hitch to Berlin from the petrol station/truck stop there. \n* If you are going to Poland, make a sign saying \'\'Bautzen\'\'. That\'s only a short ride, but just before Bautzen there\'s a great service area on the motorway where it\'s easy to find a lift to Poland.\n\nThe gas stations may not be the best place to hitchhike. There is a good sized entry lane for the shell gas station but the exit has no feeder lane which means you kind of have to choose between the street traffic or just the people at the gas station. The same goes for the, second gas station.\n\n==== Option 2 - Hellerberge ====\n{{Coords|51.0999934090384|13.7359946966171}}\n{{Coords|51.08746224093905|13.737961292266242}}\n\nAnother, good hitchhiking spot is very close to the motorway ramp. From Bahnhof Neustadt take the bus 81 towards \'\'Wilschdorf\'\' and get off at \'\'Hellerberge\'\'. If you stand besides the bus stop with a sign \'\'Berlin\'\', you probably won\'t wait for long.  It also helps that there is a traffic light just before this so often cars have to come to a complete stop and stare at you for a minute.\n\nThere is also a similar and possibly slightly, better bus stop after a traffic light 500 meters up the road from the second gas station in Option 1.  It seemed liked this one has more time with the light being red meaning more drivers had to come to a complete stop before passing the bus stop.\n\n==== Option 3 ====\n\nIf you don’t have any luck with the above options, one can also simply head to the motorway ramp itself.  There is enough space there for cars to stop and maybe even a truck if you are lucky.\n\n\n==== Option 4 - Bahnhof Dresden-Neustadt ====\n{{Coords|51.06631985028925|13.7393045425415}}\n\nVery often there are hitchhikers, right behind the railway station \'\'Dresden-Neustadt\'\'. Be aware that this is a common meeting point for car-pools, so if you stop a car there you might be asked to contribute to the cost of fuel, although generally it is very unlikely as anywhere else in Germany.\n\n=== East towards [[Görlitz]], [[Wrocław|Wroclaw]] ({{Autobahn|4}}) ===\n\n\n==== Option 1 - On-ramp Hellerberge ====\n\nFrom Dresden-Neustadt DB station; take bus number 81 (WILSCHDORF) to the stop \'Hellerberge\'. This should not take longer than fifteen minutes. Here you are right at \'Dresden Hellerau\' interchange of B170 and A4 / A13 direction Bautzen as well as Görlitz.\n\n==== Option 2 - Service station Dresdner Tor ====\n\nFrom Dresden take bus 424 or 333 from main station to station Wilsdruff Markt (about 45min ride), go north to junction Nossener/Meißner/Dresdner Straße and turn east into Dresdner Straße. Follow this road for 500m eastwards. You will see a hotel on the right. After this take the left option of the Y-junction, cross the street Umgehungsstraße  (S36) and follow the road K9034 (direction Hühndorf, north-east) for 1km. Right before you hit the freeway turn right and walk along the road parallel to the freeway. After another 500m you reach the service station\n\n=== West towards [[Chemnitz]], [[Leipzig]] ({{Autobahn|4}}), ({{Autobahn|14}}) ===\n\n\n====Option 1====\n\nGo to the tram stop \'\'Cossebauder Straße\'\' and walk up the big street (\'\'Meißner Landstraße\'\'). You can either ask people at the petrol station, stand next to the road with a sign or walk about 1,5km to the A4 ramp (see below).\n\n====Option 2====\n\nAnother good spot is directly at the motorway A4 ramp. There is quite a good place for the cars to stop; in addition, drivers can notice you in advance when waiting at the traffic lights. To get to this spot, take a bus 94 towards either \'\'Cossebaude\'\' or \'\'Niederwartha\'\' and get off at the \'\'Zschonergrundstraße\'\' stop; you can also get there by local trains RB/RE going to \'\'Elsterwerda-Biela\'\' or \'\'Hoyerswerda\'\' (get off at \'\'Dresden-Kemnitz\'\'). Both for the train and/or the bus you can use one-fare-zone ticket, so it is relatively cheap.\n\nComment by Johannes: It is possible to get a ride from here, but the spot is not as ideal as it may sound. Lots of traffic from two sides, but narrow. Drivers from the left side have literally no time to notice you, and those from the right won\'t be comfortable because they are in a curve and have cars behind them. Still possible (got a ride from here twice) but be patient and I\'d recommend going without a sign, and when someone stops who is not going your direction have them drop you off at \'Dresdner Tor\' service area (6km from that spot)\n\n\n====Option 3====\n{{Coords|51.10861743987|13.733332824457}}\n\nFrom Dresden-Neustadt DB station; take bus number 81 (WILSCHDORF) to the stop \'Am Olter\'. This should not take longer than fifteen minutes. Here you are right at, \'\'Dresden Hellerau\'\' interchange of B170 and A4 / A13  direction Leipzig as well as Chemnitz. You can try to directly hitchhike there or to use \'Rastanlage Dresdner Tor\' (10 minutes/12 kilometers from here) as a relais.\n\n\n====Option 4====\n\nFor a good service station to ask drivers directly, go to \'\'Dresden Hauptbahnhopf\'\', buy a ticket to Warthenau (2€ as of July 2013). From Warthenau, take the exit and walk right, descending a semi-gravel road. Turn right under the viaduct, and then turn right again. Here you will see an old German inn called Gasthof Warthenau. Walk to the Gasthof, then cross the street facing the Elbe river: here you will see several bus stops. From the bus stop without a shelter, take bus 331 to \'\'Huhndorf\'\', only two stops. \'\'\'Note\'\'\': this bus only runs three or four times a day, so figure out what train you should take in order to avoid an hour wait; you can figure this out to go to the information desk at the \'\'Hauptbahnhof\'\' in Dresden. When you arrive in Huhndorf, walk in the direction the bus just came for approx.\xa010 metres, then turn right to \'\'Am Rasthof\'\' (which means "at the service station") – yes, that really is the name of the street. Walk down the road to the service station (approx. a 10-minute walk), take the second left, turn right at the house (a cheap hotel) you will find yourself on an excellent service station with restaurants, a giant truck resting area and westbound drivers stopping for petrol. If you want to head to Holland, first try to hitch to Leipzig and then Magdeburg-Hannover, this way you avoid hitching through the [[Ruhr]] area, which is a pain. \n\n\n=== South towards [[Prague]] ({{Autobahn|17}}) ===\n\n\n\n====Option 1 - Parkplatz Am Nöthnitzgrund====\n\nTry to get to the Parkplatz Am Nöthnitzgrund its first  parking lot right after getting on the A17. Nearly everyone leaving Dresden in this direction is going to Pirna and will pass this park place. There is not very much traffic at this stop, but surely everybody is going across the border to the first petrol station in Czech Republic. \n\n\nTo get there use bus 351,252, 360 to stop Bannewitz Nöthnitz and walk Gostritzer street until autoban and than turn right (see Google maps). Walking from centre is 8 km to get there\n\n====Option 2====\n\nThere are a few places near bus stop \'\'Südhöhe\'\' (Bus lines 72, 76 & 360) at the overpass intersection of Bergstraße, Südhöhe, Kohlenstaße. <br>\nA. the onramp to Bergstraße (Highway 170) going south towards A17 and Prag. You can get a driver while they are stopped at the light waiting to take a right onto the highway. See other options for next steps as you are unlikely to get a long distance ride from here. <br> {I tried this option for 1h and didn\'t work at all. Cars haven\'t place to stop and usually they have other cars behind so it\'s really hard to find one that would wait at the green traffic light until you get in the car... march 2017}\n\nB. There is a petrol station ("Aral") but it is located on the opposite side of the road. It\'s the last petrol station before the motorway though. {found a car after 1h, really luckily, almost all cars go in the opposite direction... march 2017} <br>\n\n\n====Option 3====\n\nTry to stop cars on various bus stops or near traffic lights on \'\'Bergstraße\'\' between city center and \'\'Südhöhe\'\'. However, it is difficult for the drivers to stop on this road and taking a bus to \'\'Südhöhe\'\' is recommended. Haltestelle \'\'Mommsenstraße\'\' is probably the best as you can easily stand close to the bridge and ask people at the traffic light. It is not advisable to walk along highway 170 past Südhöhe.\n\n\n====Option 4====\n{{Coords|51.0070042924658|13.7294983863831}}\n\nB170, A17 / E55 autobahn interchange. There is a traffic light at entry ramp to A17 east towards Prag with a blue sign, a wide shoulder, and just after the corner to the entry ramp is a small slab of asphalt were drivers can stop. Try to get a ride to the next rest stop, about 5 minutes away driving. <br>\nTo get here: <br>\n* Get a ride to the A17 west onramp from one of the other options. They will be dropping you off on the side of the highway so be careful.\n* Take bus 360 from Dresden main station towards A17 (direction \'\'Dippoldiswalde\'\'). Press the stop button directly after you pass the onramp to A17 towards Prague. The bus will stop 200m later so walk back to the onramp. (bus stop "Nöthnitz, Bannewitz") <br>\n\n\n====Option 5====\n\nHaving tried a few of the above options, we headed to the Technical University (\'Technische Universtät\') and got a ride in about 20 minutes. It\'s along the highway to Prague and I figured it might have a younger population driving past (being based around a uni).  \n\nFrom Haubtbahnhof, take the 66 bus (heading south) to stop \'Technische Universtät.\' This will place you along the 170 highway that passes North-South through Dresden and later connects with the A17 highway towards Prague. Try hitching a ride from the bus stop. It allows plenty of space for cars to stop, and the buses come every 20 mins - so they shouldn\'t be too much of an issue for stopping cars. Make yourself a clear and legible sign so passing drivers can see where you want to go.\n\nWe (two hitchhikers) waited at the universitat (option 5) for more than 2 hours without getting any ride. The spot is good but people were not driving outside of the city so not so good. Then we walked (20 min) to the petrol station (option 1B) and there we get a ride with the first car to the first rest area when you are on the highway. It was a small rest area and not many car were stopping there and more than the half were driving to Pirna or Dresden. We waited there 2 more hours before getting a ride.\n\n\n=== South by train, hitchhiking in Czech Republic ([[Děčín]], [[Ústí nad Labem]]) ===\n\nIf you got some time and money, and prefer seeing some landscape of the Elbe/Labe valley as well as of the Saxonian and Bohemian "Switzerland" mountains, you can take the train \'\'\'S1\'\'\' from Dresden (from main station, Dresden-Neustadt and others; direction \'\'\'Schöna\'\'\') to the Czech border. The ticket is 17 Euro (as of 2015 october) - get it at the ticket machines and validate it before entering the train!\n\nYou can either leave the train at \'\'\'Schmilka-Hirschmühle\'\'\' (the ferry there is included in the ticket price) or at \'\'\'Schöna\'\'\' (and pay the ferry extra). After crossing the river by ferry, walk over the border and through \'\'\'Hřensko\'\'\'. There is a bus stop at the end of the town and a large space behind it. If there are too many cars parked, hitch at the bus stop directly.\n\nThere is not much traffic, so prepare to wait a while. Everybody goes to [[Děčín]] from here. If you\'re lucky, you will find a direct hike to [[Ústí nad Labem]].\n\nAs well the train ride as the road from Hřensko have really nice nature which is best experienced in good weather.\n\n== Hitchhiking in ==\nIf you driver is passing Dresden in east-west direction, it\'s a good idea to have him drop you at the exit \'\'Dresden-Neustadt\'\'. It\'s very easy for then  driver to get back onto the motorway and there\'s a tram station from where you can get into the city centre easily.\n\n== Passing through Dresden (North->South or South->North) ==\nIf you are coming from the North (e.g. Berlin, A13 or A4 from the East) and you want to continue to the South (e.g. Prague) you might have some troubles regarding the location of where you can be dropped off for further successful hitchhiking in case when your driver is not going further your way.\n\nThe problem is that the motorway splits just before the motorway petrol station called Dresdner Tor (Aral), so if you are dropped at the petrol station, you will get only those drivers who go the other way (to the West).\n\nThen, you have several ways to get further (in any of these ways you will have similar problems and solutions):\n* you might want to get dropped off way before Dresden, at the gasstation Freienhufener Eck West, approximately 60 kilometers before getting into the city;\n* get a ride going west onto A4 at Dresden, so that you can be dropped off at Dresdner-Tor Nord. Then walk west for about 800 meters to a local road, walk through the tunnel and walk back east at the other side of the motorway for 800 meters to get back on Dresdner-Tor Sud.\n* you find a nice driver willing to do a loop for you meaning that he must drive off the motorway after that "Aral" petrol station, make a U-turn, take the motorway in the opposite direction and drop you off at the petrol station, and only then he can either enter Dresden or make another U-turn if he is heading West;\n\n== Public transport ==\nThe public transport in Dresden consists of buses, trams and regional S-Bahn trains. All of them can be used with the same ticket given it is valid for your zone. \n\n* You can validate your ticket in both trams and buses. The machines "beeps" when you do so. Tickets can not be validated in the S-Bahn, you have to do that on the platform or your ticket might be considered invalid.\n* Ticket machines on tram stops give you unstamped (unvalidated) tickets which you validate inside the tram at any time later. Bus drivers sell stamped (validated) tickets.\n* Inside most of dresden DVB AG trams there is a ticket machine that gives you an already stamped (validated) ticket. You cannot  rely on the phrase: "I am already hanging around the machine to buy a ticket the very next moment" when inspectors are showing up around you within seconds. The given argument will definitely not be helpful! You do not hold a valid DVB AG transportation document in yours hands!\n* People carrying an adult monthly, yearly or job ticket can take somebody along on Saturday, Sunday and public holidays for free. This is possible from the day before (e.g. Friday for weekends) 18:00 until the day after (e.g. Monday for weekends) 06:00. Just ask around at the stops. Unfortunately students cannot take you.\n\n=== Blackriding (Freeloading, Freeriding) ===\n\n[\'\'The information below does not apply to the S-Bahn city train. See [[Deutsche Bahn]] instead\'\']\n\n* If you fail to show your ticket to an inspector you will most likely get a fine of 40 EUR which needs to be paid by bank transfer within about 10 days. Rumors are that even if you are a foreigner but living within the European Union an announcement to pay will be send even to your country.\n* Ticket inspectors in Dresden (DVB AG) are dressed in civil clothes.\n* They are usually neither very friendly to foreigners nor able to speak English very well. Make sure to have a valid(!) ticket.\n* Ticket inspectors are difficult but possible to spot: They do \'\'\'not\'\'\' look like students which mostly carry a laptop case and/or wear a white or light blue shirt with a collar. They do \'\'\'not\'\'\' look like businessmen which would wear suit and tie. The are mostly \'\'\'not\'\'\' older than 50 to 55 years. They are mostly \'\'\'not\'\'\' younger than 20 years. They do \'\'\'not\'\'\' carry any (large) case, (heavy or completely filled) backpack or plastic (shopping) bag with them. They do \'\'\'not\'\'\' use mp3 player or walkmen with any sort of earphones. They mostly appear in smaller groups of two or three men in an average dress (sloppy T-shirt or pullover, jeans, a fisherman vest, cheaper non-brand shoes). They are mostly standing (or sitting) together but are \'\'\'not\'\'\' talking (or arguing) to/at each other in public.\n* Ticket inspectors mostly carry a very small waist backpack or normal (but almost empty) backpack underneath a vest/shirt where their DVB AG computer devices or official papers are in.  \n* Ticket inspections are \'\'\'not\'\'\' conducted (as in some other European cities) \'\'\'on\'\'\' bus or tram platforms or \'\'\'on\'\'\' open bus or tram doors but \'\'\'only\'\'\' when vehicles are moving between two stops.\n* After 20:00 you need to get into the bus through the first door where the driver sits. Drivers are supposed to check tickets but usually do not give them a closer look. You might be lucky when you quickly show an older (and now invalid) DVB AG ticket.\n* At night, ticket inspectors in trams are accompanied by security personnel.\n* Most DVB AG ticket inspections are conducted from around 09:00 to around 13:00.\n\n== Sleeping ==\n\nIn summer you can sleep at the river. The police are never looking for sleeping people or anything. A good place is \'\'this\'\' {{Coords|51.06293|13.783811|1}}. Sometimes people camp with tents at the river \'\'here\'\' {{Coords|51.068408|13.728617|1}}.\n\nDo not put your tent in the parks, especially Großer Garten and Alaunpark. It is strictly forbidden and Großer Garten is patroulled by its own security personnel while Alaunpark could be checked by the police multiple times during the night.\n\n== Souvenirs ==\n\nYou can buy expensive stuff at the touristic shops but every Saturday there is a second hand market until 14:00 @ \'\'here\'\' {{Coords|51.057502|13.757617|1}} where people sell ancient things - e.g. from the time of the socialism - very cheap.\nMoreover you can bring or get clothes for free at the free shop [http://www.openstreetmap.org/index.html?mlat=51.068065&mlon=13.75335&zoom=16# here]. Check the [http://umsonstladen.fueralle.org/ opening hours].\n\n== Eat and drink ==\n\nNearly every day there is warm food for a low price in a different alternative house.

It\'s located in the west of Germany.\n\n\n== Hitchhiking in ==\nHitchhicking in is not that easy caused by a ring of highways going around Düsseldorf without many service stations and the ones that exist are not that frequented. However it is possible, of course. \n\n===From North===\nBest possibility is at the end of  {{Ade|52}} at the big "ARAG" building. Several options for public transport. Minus is that this is only for drivers going directly to Düsseldorf.\nIf your driver just wants to pass Düsseldorf by the  {{Ade|44}} in direction to [[Mönchengladbach]], [[Krefeld]] or the Netherlands tell him to drop you off at the Düsseldorf Iternational Airport. There is a lot of public transport like Busses, S-Bahn an RegionalExpress towards the city. Beside that you could try to hitchhike from the parking spots at the "Departure". Lots of slow cars with empty trunks and backseats. \n\n===From East===\nIf you are on the {{Ade|46}} coming from Wuppertal the best opportunity is the Exit "Düsseldorf -Wersten". There is public transport and within minutes you are at the main station or in the city centre. Plus your driver can get back on the highway pretty easy and fast. \n\n===From South===\nBest opportunities on the {{Ade|3}}. Last option is the service station called "Ohligser Heide". You have to get a lift to {{Ade|46}} eastwards and then same as above: Exit "Düsseldorf-Wersten". \n\n===From West===\nIf your driver wants to Neuss you could take it and take the public transport to Düsseldorf. Just make sure he will drop you off near the main station. \n\nIf your driver want to pass in direction to [[Wuppertal]], [[Dortmund]], or even [[Frankfurt am Main]] they might take the {{Ade|46}} and than is is the exit "Düsseldorf-Wersten", again. \nIf they want to go towards north-east to [[Essen]] or [[Bochum]] they will take the {{Ade|44}} an is possible to get out at the airport as mentioned above. \n\n== Hitchhiking out ==\n=== West towards [[Aachen]], [[Belgium]], [[Paris]] ===\n====Option 1====\n{{Coords|51.2009|6.7631}}<br>\nYou can start from the Aral petrol station at Südring 115. Take tram U72 to "Südring". From there walk about 500m the "Südring" towards the west. On Saturday evening there\'s always a "muscle car" meeting.\n\n====Option 2====\n{{Coords|51.1245|6.6002}}<br>\nTake public transportations to the bus stop \'\'Grevenbroich, Daimlerstraße\'\' in order to get to the \'\'Vierwinden\'\' petrol station] on the {{Ade|46}} in [[Grevenbroich]]. You can find a schedule at [http://www.vrr.de/de/index.html www.vrr.de]. It\'s easy to find. The bus ride will take you less than an hour.\n\n=== North, East towards [[Hamburg]], [[Osnabrück]], [[Münster]], [[Hannover]], [[Berlin]] ===\n{{Coords|51.2538|6.7993}}<br>\nThe best way to head this direction is probably to take the public transportations to \'\'Heinrichstraße\'\'. There are several Busses, Tram and Undergrounds towards it.\nWhen you arrive just walk the street \'\'Münsterstraße\'\' northwards til  \'\'Shell\'\'-gas station. Turn left and walk until you arrive in front of "Carglas". There is the best spot for hitchhiking in Düsseldorf. Much traffic at every time of the day with license plates from all over Germany and drivers going for long distances. Even in the dark hours the visibility is very good, thanks to the lights above the street. The minimum you should get is a lift to your destination if it is within the direction of Duisburg, Essen, Bochum and Dortmund or the petrol station along the {{Ade|2}}, called \'\'Bottrop-Süd\'\' if you want to go further. Waiting takes an average under fifteen minutes.\n\n=== North-West towards [[Arnhem]], [[Netherlands]] ===\n====Option 1====\nSimilar like to Hamburg.\n\n====Option 2====\n{{Coords|51.5199|6.8592}}<br>\nTake the train to \'\'Oberhausen-Sterkrade\'\'. Take the 979 Bus, but get out at \'\'Turmstraße\'\'. There is an on-ramp for the {{Ade|516}} to Arnhem there, and cars have to wait at traffic lights before going on to the motorway. The next service station is \'\'Hünxe\'\' on the {{Ade|3}}, which is strongly frequented by Dutch drivers, so if someone offers to take you there, you\'re probably in luck.\n\n=== South towards [[Cologne]], [[Bonn]], [[Frankfurt am Main]] ===\n====Option 1====\n{{Coords|51.1573|6.9641}}<rb>\nTake the public transportations to the petrol station in [[Hilden]], \'\'Ohligser Heide\'\' at the {{Ade|3}}. There are several ways to get there. If you are in \'\'\'Düsseldorf\'\'\'-\'\'Bilk\'\', type in the busstation next to you at [http://www.vrr.de vrr.de], because there are buses going there. That would be very quick. You can also just ask at the service point of \'\'\'Düsseldorf\'\'\' central station how to get \nto [[Hilden]] - Südfriedhof or Hilden S, or go to \'\'\'[http://www.vrr.de vrr.de]\'\'\' and type in the connection.\nIf you go to [[Hilden]] S-train station, you will have to walk a bit (see map). It will take you \'\'\'ca. 40 Minutes\'\'\' to get there. \n\n====Option 2====\n{{Coords|51.2025|6.7858}}<br>\nAn other option is to start hitchhiking at the \'\'Esso\'\' gas station that\'s close to the public transport station \'\'Auf\'m Hennekamp\'\'. A lot of people stop there, before they go directly to \'\'\'Frankfurt am Main Airport\'\'\'. This spot is not so far away from the city centre, so you could walk there from the centre (takes about 40 minutes to walk there from Heinrich Heine Allee, by tram you need only 7 minutes).\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n\n\n\n\n[[Category:North Rhine-Westphalia]]\n[[Category:Germany]]\n[[Category:City\'s]]\n[[de:Düsseldorf]]'},
 'Ede': {'text': "'''Ede''' is a city in the [[Netherlands]]. \n\n== Hitching out ==\nThe [[A12 (Netherlands)|A12]] motorway (to [[Utrecht]] and [[Arnhem]]) lies just south of Ede. From the A12 on the west side of town, the [[A30 (Netherlands)|A30]] branches off North (toward [[Amersfoort]]). For [[Amsterdam]] you can use either route.\n\n==={{Anl|12}} east and west===\n{{Coords|52.0209|5.6486}}<br>\nThere is a BP gas station near the onramps of the A12, on the southern edge of town. The street is called ''Willem Dreeslaan''. Everybody here goes to the motorway. You can ask people here where they are going. There is also room for standing with a sign. \n\nTo get to the BP station, you can take bus 88 from the trainstation to the hospital (''Ziekenhuis Gelderse Vallei''). Continue walking in the direction of the bus, and turn left after the barriers. You´ll see the petrol station at your left at the next intersection.\n\nIf you're headed east, there is a gas station ''Buunderkamp'' on the A12 motorway, right before [[Arnhem]].

There is a bus stop where people can easily stop just by this petrol station. This is a well known spot for hitchhiking, which was very popular in the times when Dutch students still had to pay for public transport. You can get here by taking the bus from the Central Train Station. You have two choices - bus 173 to \'\'Floraplein\'\' or bus 7 to \'\'Korianderstraat\'\'.\n\n=== South towards [[Maastricht]], [[Aachen]], south-west towards [[Antwerpen|Antwerp]], east to [[Venlo]] ===\n====Option 1====\n{{Coords|51.4054|5.4806}}<br>\nAn alternative for \'\'Floraplein\'\' is walking 2 km in south west direction. There are two entrances (towards Antwerpen, and Venlo) to the {{Anl|2}} {{Junction}} {{Anl|67}} next to the \'\'Van der Valk Hotel Eindhoven\'\', at the \'\'Aalsterweg\'\'. Due to traffic lights, people clearly see you, and can stop easily.\n\n====Option 2, Service station Meelakkers====\n{{Coords|51.4046|5.5404}}<br>\nAnother option for heading east/Venlo is taking the train to [[Geldrop]] (just about 5min, single-way ticket is 2,30€) and walk about 2km from Geldrop train-station to an Esso petrol station directly on the motorway {{Anl|67}} (only eastwards) south of Geldrop: Leave the train-station towards southwest, cross the whole park and hold left (towards south) until you cross a bigger car-road (Gijezenrooiseweg), still heading south (Laan van Tolkien), pass the supermarket on the left and go straight on through the park in the borough with streets called after Lord of the Rings-characters. You\'ll find \'\'Dwalin\'\'-path on the right, it becomes \'\'Fili\'\'-street. At the end of \'\'Fili\'\' turn right in \'\'Durin\'\'-street, follow until the end of the road, turn left in \'\'Genoenhuis\'\'-road and next oportunity turn right. Follow the road for 200 meters. You\'ll find yourself on a bridge over the A67, on the right you can see the petrol station very close. Take the steep path on the right at the end of the bridge between the highway-ramp and a fence. After a very few meters is a truck-park and the petrol station, where you can ask people for a ride.\n\n=== North towards [[Den Bosch]], [[Amsterdam]] {{Anl|2}} ===\n{{Coords|51.4832|5.4333}}<br>\nThis is a good option if you\'re in the northern part of the city. At the crossing of \'\'Boschdijk\'\' and \'\'Spaaihoefweg\'\' there\'s a small lay-by with space for cars to stop. Very easy to catch a ride to at least petrol station \'\'Ooiendonk\'\' on the A2.\n\n===North, West, South===\n{{Coords|51.4378|5.4286}}<br>\nA2 access lane 31 \'\'Veldhoven\'\' (A2 x Noord-Brabantlaan). Do not confuse with A2 access lane 32 \'\'Veldhoven-Zuid\'\', this one is quite unsuitable in both directions. Take bus 401/402 from Eindhoven Central Station. Get out at the bus stop just before the motorway (\'\'Hurksestraat\'\'), should take about 10 minutes. There are traffic lights to stand beside nearby. You can also ask around at the McD.\n\n\'\'"When I hitched to A\'dam I stood in the Noord Brabantlaan at the ramp on the A2 towards north. (bus 401/402, bus-stop "Hurksestraat") There\'s plenty space to stop for the cars, but it\'s better to thumb as to use a sign! If you want to go towards north on the A2 and cannot find a long-distance-ride, try to catch a ride to the Texaco petrol station on the A2, which is before the towns of Broxtel and Liempde (just about 8km north of Eindhoven)."\'\'\n\n=== North towards [[Nijmegen]] {{Anl|50}} ===\n{{Coords|51.4793|5.4893}}<br>\nThere is a Shell petrol station on the \'\'J.F. Kennedylaan\'\'. Go there to find a lift to the {{Anl|50}}. Hitchhiking on the road itself is not allowed because of the status of the road, although you might get away. The road has an emergency lane with traffic limited to 70 km/h. You may as well stand on the merging lane of the petrol station.\n\nThis gas station is really small, but it still could be possible to find a ride here. Myself, I did not like the place too much so I walked direction A50 to Nijmegen. If you decide to leave the gas station, you can walk for about 30+ minutes. At a certain point just before the actual ramp is a very tiny triangelish place of tarmac where a car can stop. However, this is far from an ideal spot. The flow of traffic is very dense. Go stand about 10-15 meters in front of the little spot so the car can stop on the tarmac. If you don\'t find a ride at the gasstation, this is an option to consider. This place might work better out of rush hour so there is more space and time between each car.Be carefull!--[[User:Robbel|Robbel]] ([[User talk:Robbel|talk]]) 13:39, 15 November 2013 (CET)\n\nThe employees at this petrol station might send you away, or tell you that standing on the emergency lane is too dangerous. Another option is to stand at  the acceslane from "Tempellaan", there\'s an emergency lane here where cars can easily stop.\n\n=== From the [[airport]] ===\nWhen you arrive at the airport, just follow the signs to the motorway, you\'ll reach it in 15 Minutes. The airport traffic merges here with the traffic from the city, so it\'s easy to get a ride, but you will need a sign. According to Fverhart due to the motorway works this A2 access lane 30 \'\'Eindhoven Airport\'\' is not suitable any more to the north, to the south unknown. Alternative, walk further on the Anthony Fokkerweg until a small side-road and hitchhike there, or walk further to the second road crossing after the motorway. There is a bus stop, use sign. Or in stead walk towards the south-east for three kilometres to A2 access lane 31 \'\'Veldhoven\'\'. Or try to find a ride on the parking area of the airport.\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n{{nomadwiki}}\n\n<!--Infoboxes and categorys.

It disappeared somehow in 2006.\n\n== Hitchhiking out ==\n=== North towards [[Hengelo]], [[Oldenzaal]], [[A1 (Netherlands)|A1]] service station ===\nIf you want to go towards the service station \'\'[[Het Lonnekermeer]]\'\' for long hitches into [[Germany]], get yourself towards the Deurningerstraat until end of town. Some 50m behind the last traffic light you\'ll have some space for cars to stop, pretty awesome spot for hitches towards Oldenzaal. For the service station, hitchhike for around 5-6 km and get out just behind the railway crossing. Walk up the bridge and at its left you can walk down towards the motorway and the petrol station.\n\n=== East towards [[Germany]] ===\n====Option 1, motorway towards [[Osnabrück]]====\n{{Coords|52.2869|6.9294}}<br>\nThere is an {{Anl|1}} on-ramp in [[Oldenzaal]]-Zuid. This is around 6 km north of Enschede. You can get there by taking the bus, line #60 or #62 towards Oldenzaal/Denekamp from the central bus station in Enschede. Get out at bus stop \'\'Hanzepoort\'\'. Price is 5.50 Euro (Nov 2011), another option is to go only until bus stop Kotkampweg (1,50 Euro) (or walk there) and hitch at the bus stop or traffic light towards Oldenzaal-Hanzepoort.\n\nAt bus stop \'\'Hanzepoort\'\', cross the street and walk 50m to the right. There you can stand along the [[shoulder|hard shoulder]] at the [[on-ramp]] up to the Dutch motorway [[A1 (Netherlands)|A1]] (German  [[A30 (Germany)|A30]]) towards [[Bad Bentheim]] / [[Osnabrück]]. Average waiting time is 7 minutes, most people go to Germany, mostly to [[Nordhorn]] or [[Bad Bentheim]] near the border. This ramp is the 2nd last before the German border, try to get to the parking area at the border, there you can find trucks that might go up to [[Poland]] and further beyond. If you like going faster, check out the article for the A30, it\'s practically better to catch a car towards the on-ramp Nordhorn/Bentheim and from there getting rides eastwards much faster. This is recommended for experienced on-ramp hitchhikers.\n\n====Option 2, via [[Gronau]] and towards [[Münster]]====\n{{Coords|52.1993|6.8904}}<br>\nFor hitchhiking towards Münster take bus #1 (EUR 2,20) towards \'\'Wesselerbrink\'\', #2 to \'\'Helmerhoek\'\', #73 to \'\'Winterswijk\'\', or #74 to \'\' Doetinchem\'\' and get out at \'\'P+R Zuiderval\'\'. There you can already see the motorway in front of you, just walk the 150 meters up to the ramp. At this spot the motorway [[A35 (Netherlands)|A35]] begins. For hitchhiking towards Gronau use the space in front of the traffic lights or walk a bit down the ramp.\n\n====Option 3====\nSee section above, the petrol station north of Enschede works well to go towards Germany.\n\n=== West towards [[Hengelo]], [[Apeldoorn]], [[Utrecht]], [[Amsterdam]] ===\n====Option 1====\n{{Coords|52.2012|6.8901}}<br>\nTo get on the [[A35 (Netherlands)|A35]] you just have to go to the Zuiderval. Take bus #2 towards \'\'Helmerhoek\'\' and get out at the \'\'P+R Zuiderval\'\' and walk to the higway (150 meters). You can also take line #1; for this see the spot for direction Münster. Also lines #73 and #74 take you there as written above. There are traffic lights and enough space for cars to stop. Use a sign with \'\'Deventer\'\' and try to get a lift to the petrol station before Deventer.\n\n====Option 2====\nTake bus #1 towards \'\'Universiteit\'\' and get out at \'\'Jupiterstraat\'\'. Walk 200m up towards the intersection and walk left. 20m behind the roundabout you\'ll find an information bay which is perfect for hitchhiking rides towards [[Germany]] or all into the [[Netherlands]] (Haaksbergen, Deventer, Utrecht, etc.). It might be that rides bring you only about 3 km further to the beginning of the bypass that leads to the A35. From there, it\'s a 5 minute walk along the bypass towards the on-ramp of the highway either going deeper into the Netherlands (Hengelo, Deventer) or towards Münster in Germany. The on-ramp is close to the Grolsch beer brewery, though it is not allowed to walk or hitchhike near the ramp to the highway.\n\nThough both these options will work when you\'re patient enough,  it might be wiser to take the bus to Hengelo and try there near the Gas station located just 400 metres before the ramp to the highway. For more on this option: see [[Hengelo]]\n\n[[File:Oldenzaal_ramp.jpg|thumb|250px|left|On-ramp [[Oldenzaal]]-Zuid towards [[Germany]].]]\n\n=== All other directions ===\n Info seems outdated. Please update!\nIf you are at the University of Twente, try this: Go to the entry of the University, walk the "Auke Vleerstraat" to the second intersection with traffic lights and hitchhike just behind it at the information bay. Great spot for rides into the Netherlands, towards Germany (Münster), within Enschede or Haaksbergen, though waiting times can differ during the day. This is actually the same spot as #Option 2 above here.\n\n== Sleeping ==\nIt\'s possible to camp somewhere on the University campus, if you ask the security guys at the campus entry kindly to put your tent on a hidden spot somewhere between the trees. There\'s much green on the campus, only thing will be geese that are hanging around there. ;) There\'s also a campsite between [[Hengelo]] and \'\'\'{{FULLPAGENAME}}\'\'\', not far from the University.

Generally the people who pick you up are Turkish either from the area or people on holidays. You will find that quite a few people do speak some English or German and are generally very eager to help.\n\n== Hitchhiking out ==\nDuring summer time or high tourist season there is a lot of traffic all along the south coast between [[Antalya]] and [[Izmir]]. There is no problem to get in and out of Fethiye in any direction since there is a lot of traffic. You should aim to get to the national main-road [[D400 (Turkey)|D400]] either on Dolmuş or hitchhiking away from the center of the city following the signs for [[Muğla]] or [[Antalya]]. If you wish to get a Dolmuş, then your best bet is to take one heading towards Yanniklar, then get off once you hit the [[D400 (Turkey)|D400]].\n\nIf hitching on the small road towards Oludeniz, be aware that the last bit of town near the Lycean graves is a bit dodgy. [[User:Zenit|Zenit]] and three friends met some fairly aggressive young guys and things might have turned nasty if the perfect ride hadn't showed up right in that moment.\n\n==Food==\nThe big swiss supermarket centered in this map ({{Coords|36.62437|29.12521}}) has fruitful dumpsters just behind the building. Some days there is nothing, some days you will find 3 cakes. There are really good dumpsters next to Orasta Mall, too, and good table diving inside.<br>\nThere are markets in several places in town, go there after they clear up and before the garbage collection arrives, or before clearout if you speak turkish ;)\n\n[[Category:D400 (Turkey)]]"},

Pratignone is N-W from Florence, where A1 crosses A11, it\'s a big commercial area so there are lot of trucks during the working days.\nThere\'s also a bus that goes out here from around the train station (no. 2?) and still operates after the trains have stopped. Can be blackrode easily.\n\n\nAnother great spot in this area is a big petrol station (also see [http://hitchwiki.org/maps/?zoom=17&lat=43.83541310864503&lon=11.16073346691428 map]). Directions: from Pratignone station walk southward on Via di Pratignone. Turn left on Via degli Olmi, cross the bridge over the highway and turn right on Via di Limite. You will walk through a little tunnel and see a few houses on your right; after you´ve passed the last house, walk on the dirt to your right and step over a little fence to reach the highway. There´s a gap in the sound-wall through which you can get behind it (you can see it on Google street view \'\'here\'\' {{Coords|43.8352289|11.1608223|1}}. Now you´re on the highway exit-road (watch out, cars drive fast here!) and there´s a fence between you and the petrol station. Turn left and just walk left for 200 m (towards the highway) to pass the fence where it ends (again, Street View is your friend, see \'\'here\'\' {{Coords|43.8342474|11.1589935|1}}).\n\n\nYet another option: take a bus from the train station (Santa Maria Novella) to the airport, where the A11 highway starts. (The best option is to take the bus that goes to the airport, as there are many busy intersecting highways in the area that are difficult to cross if you don\'t get dropped off in the right place.) There is a petrol station on Viale Giovanni Luder, near where the highway starts (see [http://hitchwiki.org/maps/?zoom=16&lat=43.80161482462383&lon=11.205408340266223 map]).\n\n=== South towards [[Rome]], [[Napoli]] {{European Route Number|35}}, towards [[Siena]] ===\n__TOC__\nThere is a good highway entrace South of Firenze, it was called Firenze Certosa but has recently been renamed as \'\'\'Firenze Impruneta\'\'\'. You can get here with bus number 36, or 37, get off at the stop \'Le Rose\'. \nYou can stand underneath a bridge, way before the usual big sign saying "No autostop".\nHere you can either get on the A1, the main highway running north-south, towards Rome, or get the Firenze-Siena highway.\n\nThere is a great autogrill on the A1 south-east of the city near the town of Antella, lots of cars and trucks going south.  Take bus 31 or 32 from \'Piazza San Marco\' to the last stop in Antella.  From here you can walk about a kilometre or take bus 24 to \'Peruzzi 04.\'  You can see the autogrill from the \'Peruzzi 04\' stop.  There is a fence, but the gate was unlocked.  If you choose to walk then just stay on the main road that goes through the north part of town along the A1 until you get to the autogrill (just follow the 24 route).  The road doesn\'t have a side walk, but there isn\'t much traffic.  You\'ll go up a hill as you exit the town, the autogrill is at the top of the hill.  If you want to go north there is also an autogrill on the other side of the A1 here.  There is a road that takes you under the A1 to the other side.  [[User:Trewge|Trewge]] found a ride to Rome almost instantly.\n\nAnother option: see "going North" paragraph to reach the A1 (hitchhiking for the lanes in the opposite direction of course).\n\n=== West towards [[Pisa]] [[Livorno]] [[Genova]] [[France]] ===\n\nWhen hitchhiking to Pisa, try to go by motorway Firenze-Mare, which you can reach by going to the airport. \nDon\'t go by the federal road, there are no petrol stations and lots of "No autostop" signs.\n\nFrom the train station Santa Maria Novela, get on the tram line T1 in the direction of "Villa Costanza" (you can\'t go in the wrong direction anyway, the train station is the beginning/end of the line). Get out at "Talenti" stop (just before the tram goes underground). Go on your left (when going out of the tram) and reach the roundabout. There starts the highway to Pisa-Livorno called "Viale Etruria" at this point (becoming SGC Firenze-Pisa-Livorno a few hundreds meters away). You can try to hitch hike from the roundabout or try at the petrol station further on the road, about 15 minutes by foot from the roundabout where you will catch more traffic.\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n\n\n{{IsIn|Italy}}\n[[Category:Italy]]'},

It is very close to the [[France|French]] border, and not far away from [[Switzerland]] as well.\n\nFreiburg might be a good stopover for a longer trip in [[Europe]] because it\'s quite central and easy to exit and to leave. Another advantage is that it\'s easy to find free accommodation via [[finding accommodation|hospitality exchange networks]] in Freiburg.\n\nFreiburg is a nice student town with around 220.000 inhabitants – 40.000 of them are students. So you definitely gonna find someone to drink a beer with.\n\n== Hitchhiking out ==\n===To {{Ade|5}} from the city===\nStand on the \'\'Dreisamstraße\'\' and stick out the thumb. \n\nA good spot to hitchhike from the city center is near the \'\'Studierendenwerk\'\'. There are a lot of cars on the street \'\'Dreisamstraße\'\' that goes to the highway {{Ade|5}}. A good space for them to stop is the entrance to the \'\'Café Extrablatt\'\' {{Coords|47.9906|7.8471}} on the left of the street. Just hold up a sign saying "A5" or your destination and it shouldn\'t take too long (last time tried out in March 2017).\n\n=== Direction South (Germany) {{Ade|5}} [[Lörrach]], [[Mulhouse]], [[Switzerland]], [[Italy]], [[France]], {{Ade|36}} [[Spain]] ===\n{{Coords|48.0497|7.8108}}<br>\nA perfect option to hitch out direction south. Get to the service station \'\'Schauinsland\'\' is to take Bus No.36 towards \'\'Hochdorf\'\', exit Bus station \'\'Högestraße\'\'. Be careful, not every bus No.36 takes you to \'\'Högestraße\'\', some take another route. Ask the driver, to be sure about the destination. From there it\'s just a few minutes walk to the service station along the dirt road diectly next to the motorway. The bus ticket costs 2.30€. Make sure your driver stays on your preferred highway since it splits before the next.\n\n=== Direction East [[Donaueschingen]], [[Engen]], [[Konstanz]], [[Singen]], [[Ravensburg]], [[Lindau]] ===\n====Option 1====\n{{Coords|47.9884|7.8626}}<br>\nGet to the south east of the city where the \'\'Leo-Wohleben-Straße\'\' and \'\'Schwarzwaldstraße\'\' meet {{Bde|31}}. Somewhere there is a strip of grass right in front of a side road. As this is a busy road leading out of the town, waiting times are not very long.\nYou should walk until the point where the road leads into a tunnel. There are some nice spots about 50 metres before the entrance where you can get rides easily. \n\n====Option 2====\n{{Coords|47.8883|8.3478}}<br>\nYou can take a train to [[Löffingen]] (switch trains in Neustadt, trains depart every hour), for free if you have a \'\'Semsterticket/Regio Karte\'\' and from there you can walk through the town to the {{Bde|31}}. In [[Löffingen]] is a petrol station where it s quite easy to get rides to the {{Ade|81}} to ([[Singen]] and [[Stuttgart]]).\n\n\n\n=== North {{Ade|5}} [[Karlsruhe]], [[Offenburg]], [[Frankfurt]], {{Ade|8}}, {{Ade|6}}  ===\n====Option 1, HEM gas station====\n{{Coords|48.0169|7.8562}}<br>\nThe HEM-petrol-station in the \'\'Zähringer Straße\'\'. This station is easy to reach by foot (100m) from the tram-station \'\'Hornusstraße\'\', in the north of Freiburg. There you can either stick out the thumb or ask. Approx. waiting time for the A5: 10 min.\n\n====Option 2, raststätte Breisgau, {{Ade|5}}====\n{{Coords|47.9705|7.7204}}<br>\nTo get to the "Breisgau" petrol station where you can ask for rides on the A5:\ntake tram number 3 direction Haid until the end of the line. From there take bus number 35 and get off at the station called \'\'Im Maierbruhl\'\'. When you get off the bus go back down the street in the direction the bus came from and turn right onto \'\'Freiburger landstrasse\'\'. Walk until you get to the traffic light (there\'s a bakery on the way where you can get coffee and food for the road) then turn left onto \'\'Mengener Strasse\'\'. Follow the road (about 1km) until you get to a bridge, then go left up a path--you will see the petrol station there. Two cars stopped to offer me a ride on this road as I walked, so it\'s possible to hitch rides here if you\'re feeling cold or lazy.\n\nFor heading north the next petrol station is \'\'Mahlberg\'\' right before [[Offenburg]]. For heading south there is no petrol station before the motorway leads to [[France]] ([[Mulhouse]], [[Besançon]], [[Lyon]]) but there is one before [[Basel]] ([[Switzerland]]).\n\nIf you want to go to France it might be better to get to the ramp \'\'Freiburg Nord\'\'. You can get there with tram line 2 towards \'\'Zähringen\'\', get out at the last station. From there it\'s a 400 meters walking to the spot. Try to get a ride from there to the [[A5 (Germany)|A5]] direction south. This way you pass by the service station \'\'Schauinsland\'\' which is the last one before France.\n\nI recommend hitching from the Aral petrol station on Leo-Wohleb-Straße 2. Freiburg is relatively small, so if you are in the city anyway you can very easily walk to this spot. This road goes along the Dreisam river and leads onto the A5 autobahn. In fact you will pass the hitching spot recommended in the first paragraph. I don\'t recommend that spot because its a 4-lane traffic and difficult for cars to pull over, although many people hitch from there. Waiting times at that Aral petrol station vary but it is recommended to start early so you catch workers commuting to other cities. You\'ll get drivers going north and south, you just need to ask around.\n\nI also recommend the areal petrol station.\n To get there by public transport you may take tram number 1 direction \'\'Littenweiler\'\' and get  off at \'\'Brauerei Ganter\'\'. You can see the blue Aral station on the other side of the street. \n You should get a ride within minutes.\n\n== Hitching In ==\nOne option is to get off at \'\'Schauninsland\'\' petrol station if you are coming from the north where you can walk to the next village (Hochdorf) and take the bus 25 or 36 to Freiburg. It will take about 40 minutes to the centre. It\'s better to find someone in [[Mahlberg]], [[Baden-Baden|Baden Baden]] or [[Bruchsal]] who is going straight into town. The motorway doesn\'t go directly through the city so drivers are unlikely to go 15 km extra just to drop you off in the city if they want to continue their trip. \n\nIf you are coming from the south you can get off at the \'\'Breisgau\'\' service station. There shouldn\'t be a problem with finding someone who is going into town.\n\nAnother solution, though not the best one, is to get off at exit 61 \'\'Freiburg Nord\'\' on the A5. The driver can make U-Turn and get back on the motorway (well, if it\'s not a truck). There\'s not really much space to stop, so you\'ll have to ask people stopping on the red light, most of them will be going to the city. Better don\'t go there if you\'re not alone, as you\'ll have to hop in very quickly.\n\n== Public transport ==\nPeople who have the transferable monthly ticket \'\'RegioKarte Übertragbar\'\' can take along another adult on Sundays and holidays. Students of Freiburg University don\'t pay after 19h30 on buses trams and trains within a certain region, and on Friday and Saturday, there are trams running all night. It does not include night buses. Not so many controllers, but they appear out of the blue undercover.\n\n== abgefahren e.V. ==\nThe german autostop club [[abgefahren e.V.]] is very active in Freiburg. In September 2007, [[abgefahren e.V.]] held its first gathering near Freiburg and also published the first (un)official German hitchhiking-spot in Freiburg. In 2011 abgefahren started their 4th race in Freiburg the [[abgefahren hitchhiking race 2011]].\n\n== Sleeping ==\nJust take the map of Freiburg ( there will you see the "camping place" ). You can sleep there for free ( like me ) and after the night you can take the shower.

From Hakata Station, you will need to take Sasaguri Line and transfer at Chojabaru to access Kashii Line, It should cost you 280 yen. From Suecho station, it is a 500m walk.\n\nExperience from user Savvyhitcher: I went there in June 2018 to go to Hiroshima starting from Fukuoka. The lady working at the Sue PA helped me make a sign in Japanese. The PA is rather small and has little traffic, but within 10 minutes I had a lift with a driver offering to bring me to the next Service Area. The driver was laughing and joking as he was surprised to see a westerner hitchhiking at such as small PA. I think it is a great spot to start a journey from Fukuoka. I got to Hiroshima within the same day.\n\nEdit 2019. I've used Sue service area more than 10 times and it always works, it is worth taking the bus to get there, or the train. Most people will take you to a bigger service station (Kiyama PA south is big and Koga SA north). Hitchhiking from the center of town is a really bad idea and doesn't really work as many people are just going to another part of town.\n\nExperience from user MatsumotoJoe: in September 2023, two of us found a ride here within 10 minutes (to Kagoshima!).\n\nIf you want to go to SOUTH (Kagoshima) or NORTH (Hiroshima, Kitakyushu) you should go to SUE PA.\nKARATSU / IMARI / ARITA it is easier to take the subway to Kyudaigakkentoshi and walk to IMAJUKU road and hitch at the highway entrance.\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n{{IsIn|Japan}}\n{{Category|Japan}}\n{{Category|City's}}"},

Pass a large road intersection where signs point to \'\'Szczecin\'\' and \'\'Łódź\'\' and get to your spot. Large hitchhiking sign is recommended. If your driver isn\'t going to Hel but continues on the national road, ask to be dropped off near the intersection - there is a bus stop right before the intersection and another one right after. Go on the road 216 and find a bus stop after few minutes of walking, which is a nice place to hitchhike (coordinates above - this is the spot nr 1)\n\n\'\'\'Note\'\'\': It\'s not illegal in Poland to hitchhike on a bus stop, but it is for a driver to stop there. Police most often tolerates it, but may ask you to move somewhere else. If you decide to hitchhike on a bus stop anyway, keep your backpack handy to get into the car immediately and thank your driver for taking the risk!\n\n\n===South to Gdańsk \'\'\'468\'\'\'===\n{{Coords|54.5203|18.5284}}<br>\nDuring the day travelling Gdańsk is easy as trains depart every 10-15 minutes. However, during the night, when trains don\'t depart often (there is 2hr break from 2am to 4am), hitchhiking works suprisingly well. Have reflective elements on your clothing and an enormous sign. Hitchhike at the bus stops on road nr \'\'\'468\'\'\', which is the main road connecting centres of Gdynia and Gdańsk. Bus stop \'\'Gdynia Dworzec Gł. PKP - Morska 01\'\' (coordinates: 54°31\'13.4"N 18°31\'42.1"E) right next to the main railway station is perfect. \n\n\'\'\'Note\'\'\': It\'s not illegal in Poland to hitchhike on a bus stop, but it is for a driver to stop there. Police most often tolerates it, but may ask you to move somewhere else. If you decide to hitchhike on a bus stop anyway, keep your backpack handy to get into the car immediately and thank your driver for taking the risk!\n\n\n== Hitchhiking in ==\n=== Drivers bypassing Gdynia by \'\'\'Tricity Bypass\'\'\' (\'\'Obwodnica Trójmiasta\'\')  {{National Road Number Poland|S6}} ===\nSection of national road nr 6 running along Tricity is commonly called \'\'\'Tricity Bypass\'\'\' (Polish: \'\'Obwodnica Trójmiasta\'\'). It allows drivers to avoid Gdynia centre. If this is the case and the centre is your destination, ask your driver to drop you off at the intersection of national road nr 6 and \'\'Morska\'\' street (Polish: \'\'Skrzyżowanie drogi krajowej nr 6 z Morską\'\'). Walk down \'\'Morska\'\' street towards the centre - you can hitchhike at the bus stop, take a bus, a train or just walk - would take more less one hour.\n\n\n== Useful info ==\n=== Trains ===\n==== Overview ====\nRailway transport is a primary means of transport for people travelling from Gdynia to Gdańsk and neighbouring towns of Reda or Rumia. There are several types of trains: \'\'\'SKM\'\'\', \'\'\'PKM\'\'\', \'\'\'Regio\'\'\' and \'\'\'PKP\'\'\'.\nNo matter the type of train, if you want to board without a valid ticket you are required to get in by the first door and ask/wait for the manager to buy one.\nOnline schedules: https://rozklad-pkp.pl/en . Works for entire Poland and all types of trains.\n==== SKM ====\nSKM (\'\'\'Szybka Kolej Miejska\'\'\') connect Gdańsk, Gdynia and neighbouring towns: Rumia, Reda and others. SKM trains run on a separate railway track, have separate ticket offices and separate timetables - not those blue with white inscriptions, but these yellow/brown ones. SKM trains stops at every station, including these ones described above in \'\'Hitchhiking out\'\' section: \'\'Gdynia Chylonia, Rumia Janowo, Reda\'\'. \n\nBuy the ticket either in a ticket machine or at the ticket office. If you buy a ticket at the office you need to \'\'\'validate\'\'\' it before you board a train. Validate in a little yellow machine situated most often \'\'\'in a tunnel\'\'\' or on a platform, but \'\'\'not\'\'\' in the train. After validating / purchasing ticket from a machine you need to board the first SKM train that goes where you want to go or you will need to buy another ticket. Controls are frequent.\n==== PKM ==== \nPKM (\'\'\'Pomorska Kolej Metropolitalna\'\'\') trains go from Gdynia to Gdańsk Airport. Use this one if you are going to \'\'Gdańsk Osowa\'\' - buy the ticket at the office or in a machine at the main railway station, you don\'t need to validate this one. PKM\'s final station is most often \'\'Gdańsk Wrzeszcz\'\' and that\'s what will be displayed.\n====Regio and PKP====\nRegio (regional trains) and PKP (long distance trains) can be used to travel from Gdynia to Gdańsk or Reda, but they stop only at the main stations (so, for example, you won\'t get to Rumia Janowo). Route Gdynia-Gdańsk takes ~20min (Regio) or ~30min (PKP), while for SKM it\'s more than 40min. Tickets can be purchased in a machine or at the office. For Regio, tickets are most often valid for 6 hours and during this period you can board any Regio train going to the station specified on your ticket. In case of PKP, you buy a ticket for an exact train.\n\n\n===Wild camping ===\nGdynia is surrounded by hills covered with forests. Most of them are protected as \'\'\'Tricity Landscape Park\'\'\' (\'\'Trójmiejski Park Krajobrazowy\'\'). It\'s illegal to camp in most of these forests, but this law is most often not enforced and if you don\'t make a campfire, it\'s going to be fine. From the very centre it takes no more than half an hour walking to find yourself in a forest.\n\nIf you prefer to camp on a beach, this is perfectly possible as well. Just don\'t go to the city beach, choose the one at the foot of \'\'Kępa Redłowska\'\', somewhere here: 54°29\'30.6"N 18°33\'54.7"E. Local youth refer to this place as \'\'\'wild beach\'\'\', as opposed to the city beach which is usually crowded. Once you reach the wild beach, have some fun on one of the \'swings\' hanging on the trees and in the morning climb the \'\'Kępa Redłowska\'\' to spot a beautiful sunrise.\n\n\n== About Gdynia ==\n===History===\nIt is no exaggeration to say that founding of Gdynia was a world phenomenon. Back in time, after IIWW borders changed and the Second Polish Republic found itself lacking a proper seaport. It took the authorities less than five years to transform little fishing village into a 10,000+ port city. That\'s why today Gdynia is sometimes referred to as \'\'city of sea and dreams\'\'. \n\n===What to see===\n\'\'\'South Pier\'\'\' (\'\'\'Molo Południowe\'\'\'). A berth for ships, including largest Polish sailing ships and foreign flagged vessels visiting the city.\n\n\'\'\'Kępa Redłowska\'\'\' and \'\'\'Klif Orłowski\'\'\', a nature reserve close to the city centre. Upland with a stunning view of the Gdańsk Bay and Hel Peninsula.\n\nThough it\'s not the city itself, Gdynia makes a great starting point for a visit to \'\'\'Hel Peninsula\'\'\'. With its beautiful beaches, forests and charming resort towns such as \'\'Jastarnia\'\' Hel is a popular tourist destination.\n{{IsIn|Poland}}\n{{Category|Poland}}\n{{Category|City\'s}}'},

It's located west of the ferry port in Sampierdarena quarter. There are many busses going to that area but we found the bus system rather confusing and thus walked. This should be the perfect spot for anybody heading North or West.\n\n====Option 2====\nYou can catch public transport no. 1, 7, 9, 18 or 20 (depends from which part of the city you will start) , get out at Cantore 4 / S.B. del Fossato (Fermata a richiesta) stop , walk straight up the street ~800m and turn left before the gas station because if you'll take another left up the hill you will find a perfect spot to hitchhike behind the other gas station under the bridge (turn right at the exit) : plenty of space for the cars to stop, a roof above the head if it rains.\n\n====Option 3====\n{{Coords|44.4110|8.9025}}<br>\nClose to the Q8 gas station from option 1, you can stand directly at the on-ramp towards the Autostrada. Google Maps shows a warehouse called ANAS Autoparco. Standing a few meters behind the pedestrian crossing is ideal, cars will often have to stop for other pedestrians and have plenty of time to contemplate whether they want to give you a ride or not. The entrance of the warehouse is big and barely used, so plenty of space for the cars to stop as well.\n\n=== East towards [[La Spezia]] {{European Route Number|80}} ===\n\nThere is a petrol station near the motorway in the community Nervi. Take the bus 17 from the centre of Genova and get off at the stop ''Autostrada''. The road goes up the bridge and, technically, it's not the highway yet so you can can stand there with your thumb up without fearing the police.  Most the traffic is not going far at all so you'll likely only get to the first service station.\n\n=== [[Hitchhiking a boat|Ferrys]] ===\n\nGenova has a big ferry terminal.

There is ''Biedronka'' supermarket in the centre to get a piece of cardboard.\n\nFrom the town centre - ''Plac Grunwaldzki'' (Grunwaldzki square) - go down ''Olsztyńska'' street westward. In case the swing bridge is open to let yachts pass, turn left and find a footpath on the railway bridge in order to cross ''Łuczański (Giżycki)'' Canal. Continue walking along the street - behind the canal it's named ''Moniuszki''. After few minutes the street turns right and then splits. Go left and get to the national road 59. Spot a petrol station at your left side. It is either abandoned or under construction (11.2020), thus the slip lane is a perfect place to hitch - there is a lot of space to stop safely.\n\nYou can easily get a direct ride to [[Olsztyn]]. Keep in mind some segments of the road are of expressway standard, so you are not allowed to hitchhike there (except petrol stations of course, but there are not many). If your destination is Olsztyn (or further) it's better to be patient and wait for a direct ride.\n\n=== Southeast towards [[Warszawa]], [[Bialystok]], [[Lithuania]] by {{National Road Number Poland|63}} ===\n{{Coords|54.026200|21.800947}} \n\nFrom the railway station walk eastward down ''Jeziorna'' street all the way to national road 62.

Showing a sign to cars stopped by the red light should work.\n\nThe highway M8 does run through the city of Glasgow and if one follows the way out of the Buchanan Bus Station , and then left on red light, past the university there one can see the road converging into the highway and could have been a good spot for hitch hiking but needs to be tried and tested.\n\n=== Direction [[Stirling]] ===\nGet a train to Stepps. Walk out of the station over the bridge and turn right (north west) along the A80, continue to the roundabout with the big grassy "pyramids" where the [[M80 (GB)|M80]] joins the \'\'\'A80\'\'\'. Carefully cross the roundabout and stand on the \'\'\'A80\'\'\' Stirling exit, a little way forward from the [[lay-by]] by the golf cub where cars (but not trucks) can pull in. It\'s not perfect, cars don\'t have much time to see you and stop, but it usually works for me.\n\nIf you are going further than Stirling, don\'t write Stirling on your sign. \nHitching north from Stirling to Perth, Dundee, Aberdeen etc. is very difficult.\n\n=== Direction Loch Lomond, West Scotland ===\nWalk down the Great Western Road for about a mile, heading west from the motorway. About 10 minutes after passing the Glasgow Botanical Gardens, there\'s a BP petrol station on your left hand side. A lot of traffic from here will be heading out of the city and up the west of Scotland. Don\'t get here too late, though, because a lot of the traffic is constituted by tourists. You can also use the petrol station as a lay-by and stand at the junction with traffic lights about 30 meters down the road.\n\nOr you can get a train from Glasgow Queen Street to Balloch (about 4 quid; it\'s easy to get there for free if you show willingness to pay, but only have a quid or two). Come out of the station and turn right up the \'\'\'A811\'\'\' Lomond Road. You\'ll come to a roundabout that joins with the \'\'\'A82\'\'\' - the main road heading north from here. Take a right at the roundabout and there\'s a lay-by a little way up on the the left hand side.\n\n=== Direction South ([[England]], [[Liverpool]], [[London]],[[Peebles / Galashiels]]) ===\n==== Option 1 ====\nGet the bus 255 from the Buchanan bus station, and step off on Uddinston Road junction with Fallside Road just before Bothwell (next to a church).  Walk down Fallside Rd. until you get to the motorway and Uddingston services, quite busy with traffic heading South. The bus takes about an hour, and the walk 20 minutes, so it might be better to take the train to Uddingston (15min) and then do the 35min walk from there to the services. It\'s best to hold a sign with the motorway number (AKA [[M74 (GB)|M74]], [[M6 (GB)|M6]]) or to approach drivers and ask. \nThough being a very good option to get sure, fast and long distance lifts, be aware that the bus is very expensive! 4.75£, and difficult to blackride.\n\n==== Option 2 ====\nIt is also, according to local hitchhikers, quite possible to hitch south by walking down N. Hannover St from Buchanan Bus Station, turn left at Cahedral St and then left again at Stirling St and walk until you get to the lights just before the motorway onramp, bear in mind that people go all different directions from here, west , east, south etc, so a sign and taking any lift going to Uddingston/Hamilton (where there are service areas) but being aware of shorter lifts might be a good idea, also if you try this option do come back and update this article.\n\nWill & Reed tried Option 2 in Oct. 2015 and had little luck. The bus lane is quite congested before the lights making it difficult to even see the cars as they make the turn.\n\n==== Option 3 ====\nSo this option requires some back-tracking, but it seems like your best bet! Take the Megabus/900 Bus to Edinburgh (very easy to Blackride {see below] or just a couple of pounds) and ask the driver to let you out at the Harthill Services (the bus will pull off regardless but may not stop if you don\'t tell the driver). From there, cross over the A1 on the bridge and wait at the service station. \n\n==== Option 4 ====\nThe fourth option, which I tried and which may work for you, although I had no luck after waiting for 2,5 hours is the parking lane and the parking facility directly in front of the sliproad to the M74 [{{Coords|55.8524509|-4.2694017}}]. The place could be called ideal, as every traffic on your side of the road goes to the M74 in the right direction and there are often a lot of free spaces on the parking lane. If you walk down to the traffic lights, drivers can see you truning from both directions on to the M74.\nOne of the most ideal places for hitchhiking I`ve ever tried. \n\n==== For going to Galashiels or Peebles ====\nOne option proposed is to go to Edinburgh using the 900 Bus ( use megabus uk website for 5 pounds or lesser tickets to Edinburgh or see above) then in Ediburgh walk down to North Bridge take bus number 29 / Bus 49 to Eskbank, Tesco ( in Dalkeith ) { 1.5 pounds only } . Here go on A7 and hitch hike to Galashiels . On this route there are cars which also head to Peebles. Though it may seem a little longer, but its a faster and sure way to reach Galashiels or Peebles, which otherwise you may just be stuck on some country side road where people are just trying to reach to the next village and not going anywhere near your destination.\n\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\n[[trash:Glasgow]] [[nomad:Glasgow]]\n\n{{IsIn|Scotland}}\n\n[[Category:Scotland]]\n[[Category:E5]]\n[[Category:E16]]'},

Just behind the stop is a bridge/overpass, with a ramp leading up. Carefully walk in the grass up to a traffic circle, where you\'ll see signs for any direction you want to go. There is a small shoulder right before the exit towards Slovenia, you can stand at the front of this area with your sign and get all the traffic heading towards Slovenia from this area. \u200e\n\n==== Spot 1B: Webling roundabout - emergency lane (illegal place) ====\n\n\n1) First, get to the spot 1A as described previously. Then, walk another 100m and exit the traffic circle towards Slovenia. There\'s a pretty wide emergency lane round the corner.\n\nor follow an alternative path that bypasses multi-lane, busy traffic circle:\n\n2) Take a train to Graz Webling ([https://wegfinder.at/ wegfinder] Android app worked great to find a connection), follow railroad south and turn left (east) onto Schwarzer Weg. Follow Schwarzer Weg for another ~500m, taking the left when the road forks, passing a neighbourhood, until you get to multiple overpasses. You need to \'\'\'jump over the left (north) fence\'\'\' between the first and second overpass and climb onto a hill. It may be a bit of a challenge but it\'s doable (note: the closer to the concrete overpass the more stable the fence is. I\'d recommend the right edge where the fence meets the concrete overpass). Once you get to the top, you\'ll have a big long shoulder to hitch a ride.\n\n\nThis is highway so if police catches you there and put a fine pretend that you dont have money\n\n\nFollow maps below and \'\'Google Maps satellite images of a region\'\' {{Coords|47.0315018|15.4122756|1}} to better understand instructions.\n\n[[File:Graz_to_Slovenia1.png|thumb|Getting to an emergency lane by the highway towards Slovenia, part 1|center]]\n\n[[File:Graz_to_Slovenia2.png|thumb|Getting to an emergency lane by the highway towards Slovenia, part 2|center]]\n\n[[File:Emergency_lane_Graz_SLO.jpeg|thumb|Photo of the emergency lane, part 3|center]]\n\n==== Spot 2: Roundabout behind Murpark shopping centre ====\n\nA small roundabout behind the Murpark shopping centre (and the P+R). Just stand at the corner with the car dealership. There will be a gas station behind you with plenty of room to stop. All the cars going onto the ramp must pass you and can see you clearly since they have to slow down at the roundabout\n\n=== North towards [[Salzburg]] and [[Germany]] ===\nTake bus #52 heading north from \'\'Hauptbahnhof\'\', the main train station. After 10 to 15 minues get off at the \'\'Shopping Nord\'\' on \'\'Wiener Strasse\'\'. This road leads into the E57 (= A9). There are many cars and places for drivers to pull over. At the traffic light, it is really hard for people to stop, so it is better to walk down the road until you find somewhere for people to pull in, though it is hard because people drive quickly.\n\nAlternatively there is a Shell garage where Grabenstrasse meets Bergmangasse, road number 67a. It is about a 15 minute walk north from the city park. It is easy to get a ride from there heading north and onto the A9. It\'s an easy option that doesn\'t require any public transport.\n\nOr if you want it very simple, you just walk a few hundred metres from the main train station to this [http://hitchwiki.org/maps/?place=22495 bus stop] and hitch a ride from there north to the A9 (going to [[Linz]]).\n\nYou should try getting a ride at least until "Raststätte Deutschfeistritz", an OMW gas station. Although the gas station is located on the other side of the highway and most cars will be going in the direction of Graz, it is the first and best option to catch a ride on to Upper Austria and te A1/A8/A9 highway junction "Voralpenkreuz". If you are considering this option, make sure your driver is going by the taxed part of the A9 highway and does not drive around the part where the gas station is on by taking the S35.\n\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\n\n[[nomad:Graz]] [[trash:Graz]]\n\n\n[[Category:Austria]]\n[[Category:E57]]\n[[Category:E59]]\n[[Category:E66]]\n\n[[de:Graz]]'},

An especially good spot in the early morning, hitchhiking with commuters southwards towards Assen or Zwolle. [[User:ArjanT98|Arjan]] stood here for about 30 minutes before being given a ride to Assen.\n[[User:Fverhart|Fverhart]] hitched at this bus stop when it was still active with a sign: "A7 -->" (direction Germany). However, not much traffic here goes east. This access lane is a 2.5 km walk from the central station or the city center, but can be approached on bus line 10 every half hour as well [November 2022].\n\n=== West towards [[Leeuwarden]], [[Heerenveen]] ===\n{{Coords|53.212|6.5614}}<br>\nThe [[liftershalte]] is also fine if you are going West.\nGoing at the traffic light at the entrance of the highway at the end of Emmaviaduct is another option.\n\n=== East towards [[Germany]] ===\nHitching east towards Germany is harder since there is no obvious place to start hitching.\n\n==== Option 1: Europaweg x Damsterdiep ====\n{{Coords|53.2181|6.5786}}<br>>\nSome people prefer to start hitching already on the other side of the bridge, just after the crossing \'\'Europaweg\'\'/\'\'Damsterdiep\'\'. Immediately after the crossing is an unused busstop with a Liftershalte sign. Cars can see you while they wait, though the cars in the back maybe less so. People at Spots 1 & 2 can, however, still drive towards the West or South.\n[[File:Liftplaats damsterdiep.jpg|thumb|Spot 2: Liftershalte at the crossing of Europaweg and Damsterdiep]]\n==== Option 2: Europaweg x Bergenweg====\n{{Coords|53.2115|6.5900}}<br>\n\'\'[[User:Koendev|Koen]] decided to stand at the on-ramp of the N7 at the crossing of the \'\'\'Europaweg\'\'\' and \'\'\'Bergenweg\'\'\']. Cars have some place to stop there and most go towards the east too. He got a ride in 15min.\'\' I also got a ride in this location, within 30 minutes. Make sure to stand on the east side of Europaweg. There is a small gravel turnout right off of Europaweg on Bergenweg where it is easy for people to stop.\n\nLinde also stood on the onramp on the crossing of Europaweg and Bergenweg, but was sent away by the police. They treathened with a fine of 140 euros. To reach this spot, you have to walk next to the road, there is no pedestrian/ bike path, which makes it illegal to stand there.\n\nRuss also stood on the onramp of Europaweg and bergenweg. I do not suggest this spot on Sundays. I waited for almost two hours and maybe 30 cars were going on the highway. The police passed me twice but just smiled. Probably a great spot during the week. \n\nMarch 2022:[[User:Tzuiop9c|Tzuiop]] could not find the described place, there are building sites at the crossing.\n\nJuly 2022: Traffic heading east may be directed south via Europaweg to meet the N7, due to the construction. Clicks walked around the building site to the bus stop Lubeckweg on the Europaweg. (It seems like it’s no longer operating, which is good.) They managed to catch a ride east in under 30 minutes, using a sign. Signs may be useful since not all traffic here is heading east.\n\n==== Option 3: Esso Kolham, in Scharmer ====\n{{Coords|53.1938|6.7014}}<br>\nThere is a petrol station on the highway about 10km out of town which is easily accessible by bus (cost EUR 3,50). Take e.g. Line 5 until the final station, Goldbergweg. From there walk in the direction in which the bus is going and take the first road on the right to cross the highway. You can see the petrol station from the bridge. After the bridge turn right again and walk until you are almost past the petrol station. There is a small bridge consisting of roofing material made for the employees of the petrol station to cross the water.\n\n[[User:Tzuiop9c|Tzuiop]]: On a Wednesday I stood there from 11-12.00 and 16-18.00. There were very very few cars going to Germany. I suspect this will be different on the weekends. I could not find a ride further than the border or Leer.\n\n==== By train to Nieuweschans (2h.) ====\n{{Coords|53.1777|7.2176}}<br>>\nAlternatively you can take the train (EUR 10,25) to [[Nieuweschans]] and start hitchhiking on the border service station, a walk of 2.0 kms.\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n<!--Infoboxes and categories.

 'Guangzhou': {'text': '\'\'\'{{FULLPAGENAME}}\'\'\' is the third largest city in [[China]].\n\n== Hitching out ==\n=== West towards [[Nanning]] ===\n\nThere is a toll gate at {{Coords|22.7474|108.2714}} which is easy enough to get to and is good for getting a ride. Use Google Maps to find the metro and bus routes to take. Once there, a sign is useful because the spot is also an unofficial long distance bus stop and people will presume you\'re flagging a bus if just thumbing. We\'d recommend only trying to get to Yunfu from this spot which will get you to the first petrol station on the toll way and from there, you can petrol station hop all the way to Nanning. Once we got a sign to Yunfu sorted, we got picked up within 10 minutes.\n\nWe camped right next to the toll gate in a little triangle shaped park. It has comfortable grass, and no one much cares. Just be careful of "landmines."\n\n=== North towards [[Changsha]], [[Beijing]] ===\n\'\'\'东湖收费站：\'\'\'\nTake the subway to 马鞍山公园 (Maanshan Gongyuan), and exit thru Exit C. Find the bus stop just a bit south east of the exit, and wait for bus 29. The bus leaves as early as 7:00, and probably late into the evening, but the times I know that are listed are: 9:00, 10:00, 11:00, 12:30, and 14:00. However, the bus did not leave on time, and I ended up taking a taxi for 15 RMB. The bus will take you to a strange on-ramp where all cars going onto the highway have to do a U-turn before going onto the ramp, making the base of the ramp a perfect spot for hitching. Interestingly, a few cars pulled over offering rides to Shenzhen before one took me all the way to 茶陵, a few hours Southeast of Changsha. There are a few good service stations on the highway along the way though, so if you get a ride only going part of the way and are in a hurry, you could almost certainly get a ride straight to Changsha (or farther) from one of the service stations. The 炎帝 service station is particularly touristy, so there may be more long distance rides passing through there. I noted that my “湘” sign caught more fish than my "长沙“ sign, 湘 being the character representing Hunan, and thus not scaring off the traffic that was not headed exactly to Changsha.\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n[[Category:China]]\n{{IsIn|China}}\n{{Category|City\'s}}'},

You\'ll see the main road from the bus stop, just follow the sign to "Gwangju IC". The road to the toll gate is straight.\n\nexperience summer 2018: I went there and failed to catch a ride after waiting for over 1 hour there with a sign in Hangeul. I looked good, \'\'\'it may have been sheer bad luck\'\'\'. I ended up asking drivers at the petrol station across the street to bring me to a service area/tollgate. Eventually after half an hour of talking with my phone\'s translator to them one man drove me to the tollgate towards Daegu. I then found a trucker who took me all the way. Beautiful scenery. The issue with this spot is that there was little space for drivers to pull over safely.\n\n====Option 2====\nUse a Korean navigation app (Naver Maps is very good and available in English) to find a bus to take and get off at a stop in the Northeast of the city nearby the petrol station at these {{Coords|35.2111|126.9459}}. Cross the road onto the side where the petrol station is, and follow the pedestrian walkway back to a small intersection, where the bisecting road to the right has the highway going across it by means of a bridge. Squeezed between the main road you\'ve come from with the bus and the elevated highway you\'ll see another road almost in front of you: Take this one and simply follow it. It\'s an emergency/service highway off-ramp directly behind the toll gate for traffic going East, and you can simply access the highway by walking it up. It\'s got road blocks on top of it so don\'t worry about traffic. Due to the toll gate there\'s plenty of space to stop, and indeed some trucks take their rest break here. In June 2019, [[User:Raureif|Raureif]] and his girlfriend hardly waited five minutes with a sign saying "Suncheon" in Korean when a truck driver waived them over and took them all the way to Yeosu.\n\n=== North towards [[Jeonju]], [[Daejeon]]===\n{{Coords|35.1817|126.9309}},<br>\nThere is a really good spot on the northeast of the city, quite far from the city center but the cars go really slow and there is a big space for stopping.

You can stand at the entrance of the gas station on the grass spot which forms like a little "hill" so people who were not supposed to go to the station will see you and will be able to get in the gas station to pick you up safely. You NEED a sign here as this is the entrance to the highway to go to the South towards Busan and Ulsan AND towards the West to Daegu then Jeonju, Seoul...\n\n====Option 2====\nYou can also keep walking and probably reach the tollgate to hitch from there.\nExperience summer 2018 from savvyhitcher: I reached the tollgate on foot from the center of the city. It is a good 45 minutes walk depending on how fast you walk, so be prepared. I did my sign at the gas station but after 10 minutes no one picked me up so I left. I also tried the hilly spot for 5 minutes and no one stopped. It probably would have worked but my intuition told me to walk towards the tollgate. On the way there are apricot trees which make for a delicious snack. The staff let me hitch at the tollgate without any problem and seemed not to care at all to see me (a relief after the bad experience in Daegu), as if he had seen many other hitchhikers before. \'\'\'It took me roughly 10 minutes to get a ride from the tollgate.\'\'\'    \n\n\n[[Category:South Korea]]\n{{IsIn|South Korea}}\n{{Category|City\'s}}'},

As you approach Hamburg, traffic slows significantly due to urban congestion and ongoing roadworks. Getting dropped closer to the city might result in longer travel times and fewer convenient connections to onward destinations. Many drivers tend to switch to the A1 or even avoid Hamburg at all before reaching Hamburg due to frequent traffic jams and construction in the Elbe Tunnel area on the A7. Here are some additional details based on common scenarios:\n\n=== Recommended Drop-off Points: ===\n- \'\'\'Stillhorn Service Station (A1\'\'\'): If you’re dropped here, you can (cross to the other side), walk to the bus stop Kirchdorf (Süd) and take a bus to S-Bahn Wilhelmsburg, which connects directly to the city.  \n- Another option when coming from the A1 is to leave at Highway Exit 38 (HH-Harburg). From there it\'s about 2.5 km to S-Bahn Harburg, though a bus connection is available as well (or you could ask you driver to drop you at S-Bahn Harburg). It is a bigger train station and there are urban railway connections (S-Bahn), local and regional trains aswell as express trains. \n- \'\'\'Harburger Berge Service Station (A7)\'\'\': From here, walk to the nearby bus stop **Haithabusweg**. Take a bus to **S-Bahn Harburg**.\n\n\n== Hitchhiking out ==\n\n=== East towards [[berlin]] {{Autobahn|24}}===\nThe fastest way to go to Berlin (2024) is on highway 24, to get on it you can take the bus to the bus stop called BAB-Auffahrt Horn which is right next to the roundabout which takes you onto the highway. You can either stand by the bus stop before the roundabout or you can go onto the highway right by the roundabout. It might be a bit risky because police might tell you to move, but can be worth it. User @baltaback got a ride straight to Berlin here after police told him to move. Otherwise the bus stop is a good option. Highway 24 seems to be the best and fastest way to go to Berlin 2024.\n\n=== Northeast towards [[Lübeck]], [[Puttgarden]] {{Autobahn|1}} (& East towards [[Berlin]] {{Autobahn|24}}) ===\n==== Option 1: Serways Raststätte Stillhorn Ost ====\nTake S-bahn S3 or S31 to \'\'Wilhelmsburg\'\' and then bus 13 to the last stop at \'\'Kirchdorf-Süd\'\'. Walk east along Karl-Arnold-Ring for 200 m. Keep walking straight and cross over the small bridge. Turn \'\'\'right\'\'\' after the bridge on Altenfelder Weg and walk for ≈500 m to the junction with Stillhorner Weg. If you look around here you will see an underpass, go under the autobahn and walk for 400 m until a small road to your left (Jakobsberg) just after the on-ramp. Walk 300 m north along this path and you will reach the back of the Raststätte.\n\nEven though technically possible, it is not advisable to try and go East from here. It is however possible to catch a ride downtown towards Horner Kreisel from here.\n\n==== Option 2: Horner Kreisel ====\nFollow the directions as for Berlin below. Use a sign.\n\n=== South towards [[Hannover]] {{Autobahn|7}} & Southwest towards [[Bremen]] {{Autobahn|1}} ===\nTake S-bahn S3 or S31 to \'\'Wilhelmsburg\'\' and then bus 13 to the last stop at \'\'Kirchdorf-Süd\'\' (max. ten minute trip). Walk east along Karl-Arnold-Ring for 200 m. Keep walking straight and cross over the small bridge. Turn \'\'\'left\'\'\' and walk 100 m to the parking lot of Raststätte Stillhorn. \n\nIf you are going towards the [[Netherlands]], get a ride south to \'\'Dammer Berge\'\' on the A1 (just before [[Osnabrück]]), where the [[A1 (Germany)|A1]] joins the [[A30 (Germany)|A30]] in the direction of [[Rheine]] and [[Amsterdam]].\n\n=== South towards [[Lüneburg]] {{Autobahn|39}} ===\nTowards Lunenburg the service station described above (Raststätte Stillhorn) is not recommended. Instead, take the metro or the S-Bahn to "Berliner Tor", take exit B and walk along the national road B75 to the crossing Heidenkampsweg-Nordkanalstr/Ankelmannsplatz. You can start thumbing at the traffic light (the cars towards Lunenburg go straight). You can find a safer option below. \n\n=== Another Option towards the A1: East towards [[Berlin]] {{Autobahn|24}} & (Northeast towards [[Lübeck]], {{Autobahn|1}}), South towards [[Lüneburg]] {{Autobahn|39}}, [[Hannover]] {{Autobahn|7}} & Southwest towards [[Bremen]] {{Autobahn|1}} ===\nThere\'s a lot of traffic passing through Harburg (in the south of Hamburg). It is pretty well reachable via S3/S5 or regional trains from the central station. Leave at "Harburg" and take a bus (349 "Bhf Harburg" or 152 "Breslauer Straße") to the bus stop "Neuländer Weg". On week days both bus lines operate every 20 minutes and the ride will take 7-9 mins. From the bus stop, you follow the "Neuländer Straße" for 1,0 km in the direction the bus is driving. There is an onramp on the A1 with a nice and safe roundabout (which makes it my favorite spot in Hamburg whenever I want to get on the A1), where you can start thumbing. Even though it might take you longer to get to the spot, depending on where in Hamburg you\'re starting, in my experience it is way faster and more reliable than "Raststätte Stillhorn", that is described above. \n\n\n=== North towards [[Flensburg]], [[Kiel]], [[Denmark]] {{Autobahn|7}} ===\n==== Option 1: Autobahn Junction HH-Schnelsen ====\nTake U-bahn \'\'U2\'\' towards \'\'Niendorf-Markt\'\'. From there get out and ask people for the bus station (\'\'Busbahnhof\'\'). Take bus 5 or bus 191 and get off at \'\'Freizeitbad Bondenwald\'\'. This is a bus stop with a bus bay and here all the traffic to the motorway passes by.\n\n==== Option 2: Raststätte Holmoor ====\n\nTake S-Bahn S3 or S21 to \'\'Eidelstadt\'\', and then A1 to \'\'Quickborn\'\'. It is possible to blackride. Then take bus 594 in direction of \'\'U A Norderstedt Mitte\'\' and get off after the bus goes over the motorway (\'\'Hasloher Weg\'\' stop). After getting off the bus, walk in the direction back towards the bridge (west) and you will immediately see a small road going left (Hasloher Weg). You will feel you are lost in the country side because after 200 m, this way doesn\'t look like a street anymore. Never mind, keep going straight for another 400 m and on your right you will see the petrol station. We needed less than five minues to find a driver to Denmark\n\n[[File:Leaving Hamburg direction Puttgarden.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Hitching on Horner Kreisel - illegal version!]]\n\n[[File:Hamburg-Berlin.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Hitching on busstop "Caspar-Voght-Straße" - legal version!]]\n\n[[File:Hornerbus.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Hitching spot busstop "BAB Auffahrt Horn"]]\n\nIf you\'re planning to hitchhike towards [[Berlin]] on the [[A24 (Germany)|A24]], there\'s a bus stop near a big [[roundabout]] in the southeast of the city where it\'s possible to catch a ride directly to Berlin or at least part of the way. This spot is called the \'\'Horner Kreisel\'\' and is a popular hitchhiking spot for many hitchhikers in [[Germany]]. Here you can stand and wait for a ride. This works fine. For hitchhiking to Berlin prepare a cardboard sign with a huge B written on it, which is the number plate sign for cars from Berlin and understood widely. It\'s a good spot.\n\nThe easiest way to get there is from the Station \'\'Hasselbrook\'\' (S1, S11). You leave the train in the direction of Steindamm, upstairs turn right and the after a few meters left into the Caspar-Voght-Straße. Follow this street 500 meters until the big crossing with Sievekingsallee. On the opposite side of the Sievekingsallee you\'ll see the bus-stop \'\'Caspar-Voght-Straße\'\'. Ask for the road to Berlin if you are lost. Go further up the road and look for a bus stop with a large blue metal pole in front with lots of hitch-hiker traces :). It\'s just in front of the "Horner Kreisel" and is called "BAB Auffahrt Horn". You can also reach there by taking the U2 or U4 to "Rauhes Haus". This spot is actually great, because owners of Turkish shop at the station noticed strange amounts of hitchhikers in front of their business. I think they are quite enjoying it. Just when I was about to start, they invited me in for a free Turkish coffee and cigarette (I usually don\'t smoke, but this was kind of nice). They got some carton boxes and marker just for assisting hitchhikers, so they made one for me. Highly recommended (although it was two years ago, so I just hope they are still there).\n\nPlease note, some years ago they reconstructed the Horner Kreisel. Earlier it was possible to stand in the middle of it on an bus stop, but now the bus stop is located \'\'\'before\'\'\' the roundabout where the cars are driving pretty fast, and on the Kreisel the cars have no opportunity to stop.\n\nSome hitchhikers claim that hitching on the roundabout turn-off direction Berlin is easier, as here you have much more traffic going your way. It\'s recommended to stand immediately after the roundabout, in the grass before the blue motorway sign. Cars can stop right after the motorway sign. This place is used by many hitchhikers. It\'s not uncommon to find a direct lift to Berlin in 5 minutes. But it has to be pointed out that doing so is against the law, for the Autobahn starts there − and you must not walk or stop on it. Hitchhikers and drivers, who stop there, can be fined. Apart form the legal aspect, bear in mind that this may be dangerous for you! \n\n\nIf you want to go to Puttgarden for going into [[Scandinavia]], you can hitch to the ferry at [[Puttgarden]], and get a ride straight to [[Copenhagen]].\n\n=== Northeast towards [[Lübeck]], [[Puttgarden]] {{Autobahn|1}} ===\n\n== Sleeping out & Tips ==\nEventhough theres a lot of parks and hidden spots in town where you can camp or simply sleep the night off in the ground, I would recommend to go to Hauptbanhof (central train station) and catch the regional train that goes towards \'\'Maschen Train Station\'\' {{Coords|53.4034|10.0663|1}} (not to be confused with the nearby village as you would be directed to take buses on a more complex route). The deal with Maschen is that its the second largest Freight Train Yard in the world (and only by a few tracks not the first one), its quite a sight and a great place to hang out specially if you appreciate freight trains and large infrastructures. Theres a ton of spots to camp right by the yard but I would suggest to find your way to one of the 4 lakes that you can find right next to it.  [https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?whereami=1&query=53.3942%2C10.0635#map=16/53.3942/10.0635 See im Mascher Moor] should be your best bet but beware that its the most popular one so you might wake up with a lot of people walking by (but camping is ok as people do it all the time, specially on fishing trips). Take a moment to walk up the bridge crossing the yard and take that marvelous sight. Notice that the Bridge is under constraction (as of May 2021) so you cant walk easily from one side to the other (but you can if you can crawl under that fence or jump thru the sides). My second recommendation is [https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?whereami=1&query=53.4191%2C10.0478#map=16/53.4191/10.0478 See im Grossen Moor] which I found more peaceful in terms of people but a bit noisy due to proximity to a highway. There are portable toilets on the way to the sandy beach and you should find enough spots right by the water to camp. To go there its a better idea to jump out from the train at Meckenfeld train station as its a much shorter walk than from Maschen Passenger Station.\nIf you happen to be caught on a storm or something, theres the [https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?whereami=1&query=53.41199%2C10.05329#map=18/53.41199/10.05329 creepy tunnel] that goes all the way under the freight yard where you would be safe from rain and winds but maybe not from dracula. If for whatever reason you dont wanna take this route or the bridge in order to cross the yard and you take on the stupid idea of walk thru the tracks, beware that this is a freight yard where trains are assembled and dissasembled, which means that theres a lot of silent killer-wagons being released into the tracks, no lights and no sounds. Just silently ghosting their way thru the yard and if one of those heavy tons of steel should hit you that would be it for you. Then theres the tracks where the fast trains show up in a split second. So my advice, no walking thru the tracks unless you have eyes and ears all around your head and know how to use them.\n\n== Public transport== \nNotice how there seem to be no ticket inspectors at all in Hamburg, Ive been on and off in that town in the years 2018,2019,2020 and 2021 and taken countless rides on buses, sbahns, ubahns and regional trains going in and out of the city and never been asked for a ticket.\nSometimes there are large-scale ticket inspection operations.

All of the major roads here seem to have no hard shoulders, and subsequently, '''hitching out''' is sketchy at best... Luckily, this isn't the case for the direction Zwolle/Ommen/Almelo.\n\n== Hitchhiking out ==\n=== South towards [[Almelo]] and [[Tubbergen]] / [[Oldenzaal]] ===\n====Option 1====\nGo down to the roundabout at the {{Nnl|343}} ''Twenteweg'' and try there. There is no hard shoulder for vehicles to pull over, actually, the entire N343 up here is very hitchhiker-unfriendly as a matter of fact, but at least here you get all the traffic out of town, and it's going slow enough to be able to stop. Another possibility is to catch bus 80 down to [[Kloosterhaar]], 10 kilometres south of Hardenberg, where the road to Tubbergen / Oldenzaal and Almelo split. At least the N343 down to Oldenzaal has better shoulders here, and most traffic goes at least to Tubbergen.\n\n====Option 2, Untested alternative====\n{{Coords|52.5726|6.6052}}<br>\nThere seems to be a small parking bay with a city map.\n\n=== North towards [[Coevorden]] and [[Emmen]] ===\n{{Coords|52.5748|6.6018}} Onramp.<br>\n{{Coords|52.5797|6.6132}} Parking bay<br>\nWalk down the ''Haardijk'' to the ramp of the {{Nnl|34}}. Again, no hard shoulder, but you're very visible and most traffic will go at least up to [[Coevorden]]. You can also walk along the shoulder to a parking place about a kilometre down if you wish to catch all traffic on the road, but I would advise against it, because the parking place is small, and the traffic goes by fast. It will not necessarily lead to better pick-up times.\n\n=== West towards [[Zwolle]] and [[Ommen]] / South towards [[Almelo]] ===\n{{Coords|52.5743|6.5964}}<br>\nFollow the ''Haardijk'' past the on-ramp in the direction of Emmen and the viaduct over the {{Nnl|34}}. Take the first left at the traffic lights and cross the road once on the ''Koningsspil''. You'll find yourself at an amazing hitchhiking spot: very long emergency/parking lane, long enough for trucks to stop, right on the road heading to the on-ramp. (Almost) all drivers heading from Hardenberg to Ommen / Zwolle will be able to see you and will have enough time to decide whether they want to pick you up. Note: this spot should also work for Almelo, but some (most?) drivers take the {{Nnl|343}} and only get on the {{Nnl|36}} at [[Mariënberg]]. Since the reconstruction of the N34, it makes very little sense to accept a ride to ''De Witte Paal'' (the roundabout connecting the N34 and the N36), because of an absolute lack of suitable hitchhiking spots between Hardenberg and the intersection. Try to avoid taking any rides not getting on the N36 if heading to the south.\n\n<!--Infoboxes and categories.

It's only some 5 km.\n\n=== East towards [[Germany]] {{Ade|30}}, West towards [[Apeldoorn]], [[Utrecht]], [[Amsterdam]] ===\n====Option 1====\nTake the bus #11 and get out at ''Kleine Driene''. It's situated directly near the ramp ''Hengelo-Noord'' onto the [[A1 (Netherlands)|A1]]. Just walk the street some 500 meter up. Then you can decide, going towards [[Germany]] or direction [[Amsterdam]]. Be prepared: Hitchhiking on this spot might be hard, because the traffic lights that lead cars to the ramps on the highway in either direction are as good as allways green. This and the fact that there is no real spot for cars to stop to pick you up, will make it hard to take off. \n\n====Option 2, Service station Lonnekermeer {{Anl|1}}====\n{{Coords|52.2814|6.8526}}<br>\nFrom the train station Hengelo take bus 14 to ''Bruninkshoek''. You now find yourself on the street ''Oostelijke Esweg''. Walk in the direction the bus just came from towards the street ''Hasselerbaan'', then turn left. Walk down until you cross ''Oldenzaalsestraat''. Turn left and you will see a footbridge overlooking the {{Anl|1}}. When you have crossed the bridge, don't turn right but walk through the grass and descend down. Turn left before the ditch and walk with the ditch on your right (The same direction the cars go on this side of the highway) Continue until you see a little forest; here you have to jump over a small ditch.

From this gas station you can decide whether you ask the drivers who stop there for gas for a ride or whether you'll make a sign and try your luck with oldschool hitchiking; the cars can stop at the gas station very easily. \n\n\n== Overall Rating ==\nThis city is quite a bad place to hitchhike, because in the city, even at the roads to the motorway, there is not enough space where cars can stop.

It was snowing heavily and this was my first experience of actually asking drivers to take me, which was very nerve racking. The traffic was not very heavy which I believe was due to the cold weather, but nevertheless a driver eventually offered me a ride to Fukuyama PA. Lots of people driving trucks long distances though due to the location of the PA itself many people will actually be exiting the IC towards Hiroshima.

In \'\'\'religious neighborhoods\'\'\', it can be perceived as offensive not to dress modestly, and can attract unwelcomed attention. However, in the city center and old city (not inside the religious sites themselves, obviously) there is no such problem.\nYou can hitch hike in the nighbourhods, just find deserted stations and try. most of the city are walkable and the buses are cheap. Make plastic card "Rav Kav\', otherwise you can\'t pay. It\'s free and possible to make in the CBS and another spots\n\n== Hitching out ==\n__TOC__\n[[File:CraigIsraelKfarAdomim.jpg|thumb|220px|right|[[User:Halt, Stop! Reudnitz kommt.|Craig]] at Maale Adumim Junction en route to Dead Sea (5 mins).]]\n[Moriya:] Jerusalem has at least 6-7 roads to get out,to different directions. It\'s changes often by the massive constractions but in general, choose your next destination and ask local where the best spot to hitch out. the following is list of spots based on the direction:\n\n\n== MAIN Junction to get out: ==\n"Hayeziaa Me\'A\'ir"- The enternace of the city, called as well Ginot Sacharov. (\'\'Google street view\'\' {{Coords|31.7913627|35.1966262|1}}) 1 road, the huge Trempiyada that close to the CBS. it\'s the road to Tel Aviv, Haifa and all Gush Dan, and the way to the states highways- 2, 6.. If you come from city center, you walk through tram lines to the ugly bridge, and down the bridge you continue straight.you will see 2 crossroads and on your right will be to petrols stations- yellow one and one call Sonol. Keep staright. you will see huge place to stand, bus statins and often tons of people that hitch hike too. find your spot and stand. Most likely you will see other hitchhikers standing there too. If you get bored or want to burn some time, just behind you there is an old Palestinian village ([[wikipedia:Lifta|Lifta]]), whose population expelled by Zionist paramilitary forces during the Nakba. Go down the stairs and find your way to the local spring. Although basicly from this spot people go to all the country, not many people stop, and you may stuck inside all the traffic jams. So if you want easyer, beautyer and often shorter way to south or north, use another way. \n\nHitchhiking to Tel Aviv on Road 443 can be a bit tricky, but here are some tips to improve your experience:\n\n* You can stand at French Hill, just on the other side of the tram station in Givat Hamivtar. While this spot is not ideal for hitchhiking towards Tel Aviv, it can be used if you’ve already hitched from the Dead Sea, northern Israel, or the West Bank and wish to continue to Tel Aviv.\n*  Alternative spot: On the other side of the large intersection, there is a smaller bus stop. Cars passing this stop may be heading into Jerusalem or towards Tel Aviv via Highway 1 or Highway 443. Having a sign indicating your destination can significantly increase your chances of getting a ride.\n* Highway 1 Considerations: There are limited good spots to stop on Highway 1, with the Hemed station and Latrun intersection being the most notable. It’s advisable to wait for a direct ride rather than relying on this route.\n* Highway 443 Advantage*: If you can get a ride partway on Highway 443, such as to Modiin, it’s much better. This road has bus stops at almost every intersection, making it easier to continue your journey.\n\n\'\'\'Important Note\'\'\': Please be aware that Palestinians are not permitted to use Road 443, which is designated as a restricted road. This restriction is part of the broader context of movement limitations in the region. For more information, you can refer to [https://www.btselem.org/publications/summaries/200408_forbidden_roads B\'Tselem\'s report on forbidden roads]. Always consider safety and local regulations when hitchhiking.\n\n== To the north, south and Dead sea: ==\n\nJerusalem locate, geographicly in the excat center of Israel, which explaines why to hitch hike to nirth and south is the same spot. for years, the best way was through the Trempiyada in French hill, but roads changed and people barely stop there nowdays .(2018) Currently spot is the station to Maa\'le Adumim that close to the Hebrew Uni. From city center- take the tram to Ammunition Hill, \'\'or\'\' you hitchhike from in front the Damascus gate (sounds strange, but worked numerous times: 10 mins, 5 mins). Get down, cross the road to the right, you can see huge white stutue on your left. Keep it on your left.  and start walk, You will walk like 15 minutes. Than you will see station that have many buses that stop. Check if it\'s written that there is a bus that go to Kfar Adumim. if the answer iis yes- than you are in the right staation. Take a lift to Kfar Adumim (or further) you will pass Maale Adumim, and Mishor Adumim. when you get down, you will see that you are in road 1#. all the lifts good for you, try to get to Bet Haarava junction, where road 1 meets highway 90, which can take you north towards Beit She\'an, Tiberias and generally northern Israel (serving also Allenby border crossing and Sheikh Hussein border crossing to Amman) and south towards the Dead Sea and Eilat.\nSo if you need to get to the Dead Sea and your ride goes to northern Israel (Beit She\'an, Tiberias etc.) or vice versa, get off at the last junction before Beit HaArava - at Almog junction. Almog junction functions as a refreshment stop, so kiosks, mini-market and (free) toilets are available here, so that\'s the best way to hitch another ride. Beware! this is a desert area, so being near a refreshment stop helps.\n\n== To the west bank- north area: Binyamin and Samaria sttelments, Nablus and cet: ==\n\nCheck the section of [[west bank]] for more detalis, but anyways, from Jerusalem: French Hill used to be the best spots, but it\'s changed (2018). Nowdays the Trempiyada is in Hizma Junction. take the tram to Sayert Duchifat (almost last station), get down and take the crossroad to your right. there is a station, not so good spot but for lazy people you can hitch hike there insted of walk 20 minutes down in the road to Hizma junction. every lift is good to Hizma Junction, and sometime you will get lift straight to your destination. Hizma Junction is a soldiers checkpoint, you will see many people standing there. Sign can help and watch the que.The people that stop will be 90% of the time religius setllers, so if you want to go to Rammalla cheeck where excatly you need to get down to coninue, and be aware that people will not like the idea you go there, and can\'t give you ride straight to there, due the politics issues. You can hitch from the same place towards Ramallah (and from there you can reach Nablus and other Palestinian cities). Be advised that if you’re standing in this stop with a sign that says “Ramallah” on it, it\'s quite possible people are going to look at you like you’re crazy, and might try to convince you not to go there, that it’s dangerous, etc. \nIt\'s almost secret but you can even hitch hike to Netania, Tel Aviv, Haifa from this stop if you heading to Samaria (through 60 road, 5, 6) but it longer and you will need many lifts. Rides from here are available to the Ramallah area ([[Ramallah]], [[Ofra]], etc.) As well as further in, towards [[Nablus]], via "Tapuach Junction" ([[Ariel]], [[Salfit]], [[Buddya]] etc.)\nThe buses to this area are really cheap (sometime 3 shekels!) so check where you need exactly to go and your time- maybe bus is better..\n\n== To the west bank- south- Gush Ezyon, Hebron, Beer Sheva ==\n\nSame rules about the [[west bank]] section. \n\nTake bus to Gilo (71, 31, 30..) get down in Afarsemon street. cross to the left, you will see huge road, on the left there is Trempiyada. If you need to Go to Hebron, ask people where exactly to stand. If you not sure where to get down ask the driver, where is the Gush Ezyon\'s Trempiyada.\n\n \nTo Tekoa (Gush Ezyon) : take the bus to Har Homa (Homat Shmuel) 74, 75. Get down in Shmuel Meir-Kvish 378. It\'s the same way to Bet Lechem, but Israelies car not aloud to go there, and arabs not aloud to do the way around.A bus ride to Bethlehem only costs 8 NIS, consider using the bus. Bus #231 or #234 can be taken from the bus terminal in front of Damscus gate of the Old City of Jerusalem. You can hitch a ride to  [[Gush Etzion Junction]] and continue from there to most of the villages in Gush Etzion or on to Hebron and Kiryat Arba.\n\n\nThough, to get to the Hebron or Kiryat Arba, there is a bus #381 which costs just 8.1 NIS. \n\n\nYou can consider to walk instead of HH. Jerusalem to Bethlem is just 8 km. I\'ve done it in less than 2 hours walking slow and take my time. The view is not the best but if you arrive walking you will able to see the big wall which it separetes Israel to the West Bank. You have to take the entrance for tourists,very fast, few people pass there. The palestinian pass by another gate. Above all you will see the wall and read the different stories of the palestinian during the occupation and you will see many grafitti on the wall, some of them were made by Bansky. Bansky\'s graffitti are spread around Jerusalem but if you go to the center the (annoyng) taxies will take you to a tour to see Bansky\'s graffiti.\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n[[Category:\n\n[[Category:Palestinian Territory]]'},

From there you can start hitching along national road 79.\n\n====Option 2====\nAnother option is an unused bus stop on Tadeusza Śliwaka street, right before the road junction leading to {{National Road Number Poland|4}} {{E|40}} going east, the GPS coordinates are: 50°02\'15.0"N 20°03\'34.0"E. Use https://krakow.jakdojade.pl/ to check the buses going near that spot, preferably use a connection that will end up at bus stop \'\'\'Przewóz\'\'\' (Bus 158), as it\'s the nearest one to the spot. This bus stop is right behind the traffic lights, with a lot of space for even a big truck to stop and You will be easily visible. It is not the most popular road leading out of Cracow to the east however, so waiting times may vary. \n\n\nIf You are going to Ukraine, bear in mind that recently finished {{National Road Number Poland|4}} {{E|40}} highway leads to [[Korczowa-Krakovets border crossing]], where You \'\'\'cannot\'\'\' cross the border on foot. it is permitted only at [[Medyka-Shehyni border crossing]]. Also there are very, very few cars stopping at the gas stations and rest areas on highway east of [[Rzeszów]], so before You pass it, either enter a car going straight to Korczowa border crossing (and wait a long time in the car queue), or go straight to Przemyśl, where You can easily access Medyka-Shehyni crossing, avoid rides to towns like Łańcut or Przeworsk, as most likely You will get stuck there.\n\n=== South and southwest towards [[Rabka-Zdrój]], [[Ružomberok]] ([[Slovakia|SK]]) {{National Road Number Poland|7}} {{E|77}}, [[Zakopane]] {{National Road Number Poland|47}} and [[Bielsko-Biała]] {{National Road Number Poland|52}} ===\n\nTake tram no. 8, 19, 22, 23, 40 (operating only on Sundays and day offs) from the centre to the last stop \'\'Borek Fałęcki\'\'. There is a small bus station here. You can either walk south for a couple of kilometres until you go under the highway overpass, or take bus 175, 235, 245, 255, 275, 285 and get out at the stop \'\'Opatkowice\'\' immediately after the highway overpass. You can hitch from the \'\'Opatkowice\'\' bus stop.\n\n\nAlternatively if you start out early in the morning, you can take the above mentioned bus \'\'\'285\'\'\' much farther away from the city to a much better spot. Get off at Mogilany Ośrodek Zdrowia. This is a bus stop on the highway, hitch from here. Excellent spot! (In case nobody speaks English and you don\'t know where to get off, if you are in the front of the bus near the driver, you will see a red bridge from the distance, this one: \'\'Mogilany Wiadukt\'\' {{Coords|49.939466|19.894601|1}} As soon as you see the bridge in the distance, get off immediately. In case you miss it, no worries, you can get off after the bridge and walk back maybe one kilometer) \n\'\'\'WARNING\'\'\': the bus operates very rarely (and \'\'\'doesn\'t\'\'\' go on Sundays!), so you should check the timetable here:\n[http://rozklady.mpk.krakow.pl/aktualne/0285/0285t001.htm 285 bus timetable]\n\n\nIf you are going towards [[Bielsko-Biała]], tell your driver immediately so that he knows to leave you at the fork in the road a few kilometres south of Krakow.\n\n\nIf your are heading to Slovakia, the road splits towards SK in [[Rabka-Zdrój]]. At the fork in the road itself there is a good spot to hitchhike, though there is mainly local traffic and it may require a couple of lifts to reach the Slovak border. Alternatively, if you don\'t want to hitchhike in Krakow or save some time, you can take a bus to this spot for 9 PLN, which is not that pricier from what would you pay for public transport in Krakow. Bus stop is called \'\'Skomielna Biała, skrzyżowanie\'\'. You can use [http://www.busy-krk.pl/en/rabka-zdroj-krakow.php this site] to check timetables. You can also take a similar mini-bus to Jabłonka (which is right at the border) for about 20 PLN.\n\n== Public Transport ==\n\nThere is a very useful and simple to use [http://krakow.jakdojade.pl/?locale=en website] showing you how to get from one point to another by public transport in major Polish cities (in Polish and English).\n\n== Sleeping == \n\nThe central station (Dworzec Główny) is open during the night, but guards patrol the station constantly and wake up anyone who tries to sleep (even people waiting for trains). Better to find a host from a hospitality exchange service or camp outside the city.\n\nYou can sleep in "student academic" which is on Czarnowiejska/Reymonta street and there are sleeping students from AGH ( Academy of Science and Technology ).

You can also take a bus #25, #45,  #81 or #745 to the area east of the airport. The closest bus stop is \'\'Qta do Morgado\'\'.\n\nThis petrol station is in \'\'Segunda Circular\'\' (the ring), right before the motorway [[A1 (Portugal)|A1]] direction north towards [[Porto]], [[Coimbra]] & [[Aveiro]]. It can be difficult to get a ride because people might only come to fill up their car and go the suburbs or back to the city centre. Keep asking for a lift to the A1, at least to "área de serviço de Aveiras", the first petrol station on the highway, from where you\'ll have no trouble going further. You can check out all petrol stations along the [[A1 (Portugal)|A1]] motorway.[http://www.brisa.pt/PresentationLayer/areasservico.aspx?menuid=10 here]\n\nNote: If you\'re going to Spain and France, reach the \'\'área de serviço de Santarém\'\', the second petrol station on the A1, and find someone who goes to the A23. \'\'Vilar Formoso\'\', near Guarda, is the busiest border Pt-Es, and this is the best (and shortest) way to cross Spain, through Autovía de Castilla. \n\n==== Option 2, Motorway Toll ====\nIn case you\'re going north, consider taking the [http://www.cp.pt/cp/displayPage.do?vgnextoid=87cbd5abe2a74010VgnVCM1000007b01a8c0RCRD train] from  Lisbon to [[Vila Franca de Xira]] (30min by train), you have both the national road and the toll for the A1 motorway in a walking distance. \n\nThe walk to the Motorway Toll is not exactly close but you come out of the station turn right, just ask anyone the way towards the A1 Tollway. Ask a road to McDonald\'s Vila Franca de Xira keep walking you will see \'\'Aldi\'\' super market on right and a \'\'Galp\'\' petrol station on left, keep walking and then you will reach a roundabout where the second exit on the right is the Toll Road going to Lisbon as well as Porto.\n\nSearch rides on tolls or on the entry road to tolls\n\n[[File:Hitchhiking_Lisbon.png|right|thumb|334px|[[User:EliasExplores|EliasExplores]] at this spot with a sign provided by a worker of the petrol station.

From there walk 5 minutes to the \'\'Galp\'\' petrol station in the bottom of the road \'\'Calçada de Carriche\'\'. You\'ll have to cross this multi-lane road to be on the right side (direction out of Lisbon), be patient and careful... This is the last petrol station before the highway, but drivers can still go to many other different directions, you just have to keep asking (feedback so far varies from hopeless to great spot!). The first service station in the A8 will be \'\'Loures\'\', some 20 km away, and the second \'\'Torres Vedras\'\'.\n\n=== South or East: [[Beja]], [[Évora]], [[Faro]], [[Madrid]], [[Spain]] ===\n====Option 1====\n{{Coords|38.7095|-9.178}}<br>\nGo to \'\'Alcântara\'\' (Alcântara-Terra train station or bus e.g. #720, #52, #24, #773) and walk to the access of the motorway that leads you directly to the bridge over the river direction south via the [[A2 (Portugal)|A2]] motorway. Walk up the on-ramp and immediately before the motorway there\'ll be a little parking space where cars can stop. Traffic on the bridge is huge so the cars aren\'t going that fast.\nBe aware that it\'s forbidden to hitch-hike there because the parking plot is considered as part of the highway. You may be spotted by the camera and they may come specially to bid you to leave the place.\nIf you don\'t want to risk the police, you can hitch legally at the entrance of the ramp, there is plenty of space to stop and cars drive slow enough.\n\n====Option 2====\n{{Coords|38.6224|-9.1338}}<br>\nTake the \'\'Fertagus\'\' train, at \'\'Roma Areeiro\'\', \'\'Entrecampos\'\' or \'\'Sete Rios\'\' train stations, cross the river and get off at \'\'Foros de Amora\'\'. From there just walk under the [[A2 (Portugal)|A2]] motorway and get to the petrol station right next to it. Both the petrol station and motorway are surrounded by a fence, so you need to go around and ring the doorbell in the back, so that they\'ll open the door.<br>\nOther option: right after crossing under the highway, go up and get around the highway fence and then walk right next to the highway for 100m until the petrol station.\nThis will be the first petrol station on this motorway and from there you can ask people which way they headed and take off towards south or east. But as a lot of drivers in this station are going in different directions or very short distances, it is good to take a first ride to Palmela service station, where it is easier to get longer ride. Cars will go either through the A2 towards the south (Algarve), or the A6 towards east (Évora and Spain).\n\nCheck out all the petrol station on [[A2 (Portugal)|A2]] motorway and [[A6 (Portugal)|A6]] (towards [[Spain]]).\n\n====Option 3====\nCatch the \'\'Feragus\'\' train to \'\'Fogueteiro\'\' station. This station is adjacent to the [[A2 (Portugal)|A2]] highway. Exit on the south side and follow the footpath around the nearby buildings (you should be able to follow other passengers). Turn right and cross the bridge. From here you can hitch near the on-ramp or illegally on the highway itself a there is plenty of space for cars to stop in the emergency lane. This is a good spot to catch a lift south to the [[Algarve]] or east towards [[Spain]]. However keep in mind highway patrol near metropolitan areas such as Lisbon are far less patient with hitchhikers than their rural counterparts.\n\n=== West to [[Sintra]], [[Cabo da Roca]] ===\n{{Coords|38.7366|-9.1719}}<br>\nGo to the train station \'\'Sete Rios\'\' (by train or by metro to \'\'Jardim Zoologico\'\'). Leave the train station in direction of [[Campolide]] (South) and when you take the southern exit go straight (follow the street over some kind of bridge), turn right at the crossing and you will see the motorway in front of you. Go behind the bridge to the roundabout, you\'ll see the directions towards Sintra. Plenty of space and cars go not to fast. You will get on the IC19 going all the way to Sintra.

Brnčičeva) or 11 (dir. Ježica) and get off at the stop "Smelt", close to the WTC tower. Walk a bit further on towards the motorway and turn right at the crossroads. Right after the fountain you will see the road forking, the left lane going down to the motorway, the right lane going higher up. Stand with your sign in the middle between the two lanes, or on the pavement next to the parking place entrance. Even though the first option might look a bit strange, this is the most common spot and it\'s easy for drivers to see you and there\'s enough space for one car to safely stop there.\n\n\'\'\'Option 2: Letališka\'\'\'\n\nTake bus no 27 towards "Letaliska" and get out at "Jarše". Continue following "Šmartinska cesta" about 400 meters and turn right from the traffic lights. There is a bus stop right after. Most of the cars passing now are going towards the highway. You can also take bus no 2 to "Nove Jarše" from Southern part of Slovenska cesta. The last stop is the mentioned hitchhiking spot.\n\n\n=== Northwest towards [[Kranj]], [[Bled]], [[Villach]], [[Salzburg]] ([[Austria]]), [[Munich]] ([[Germany]]) {{E|61}} ===\n\n[[File:Hhfromljubljana.jpeg|right|thumb|334px|Hitchhiking spot for direction: Kranj]]\n\nDirection north-west there is the motorway E61/A2 towards Kranj through the Karawanken Tunnel (Slovenian: \'\'Predor Karavanke\'\') or over the pass over the border to Villach (slov.: \'\'Beljak\'\') in Austria and further on on the Tauern-motorway to Salzburg and over to Germany. It is the way that is used by most of those numerous Germans that go to the Croatian coast for hollidays.\n\nThis motorway E61/A2 starts from the Ljubljana bypass. The best way to join this motorway is from the street Celovška cesta, at the bus stop Šentvid (stand in the corner before the bus stop!!). Get there by bus number 1 (direction Vižmarje), 25 (dir. Medvode), or 8 (dir. Gameljne) from the city centre. If people who pick you up don\'t go as far as you like, you can get a lift as far as the first "Petrol" gas station on the highway (17km away) or the former toll station Torovo and keep hitchhiking there. There is also a petrol station at the Radovljica-exit (right before Bled) which is useful for getting into Austria. Another option is to get dropped  at ~25km from Šentvid, there\'s a great hitchhiking spot \'\'here\'\' {{Coords|46.2670938|14.3397483|1}} on a ramp where there\'s enough room for a car to stop (GPS 46.267470, 14.339623).\n\n=== Southwest towards [[Koper]], [[Nova Gorica]], [[Rijeka]], [[Pula]] ([[Croatia]]), ([[Italy]]) {{E|61}} ===\n\n\'\'\'Option 1: Rest stop Barje - North (Avtocestno počivališče Barje - Sever)\'\'\'\n\nCatch bus 1 to bus stop "Tbilisijska", continue walking in the same direction and turn left at the roundabout. Follow the road for a few more minutes and cross the meadow to reach the rest stop. Alot of cars and trucks are going to Italy from here, easy to get a ride west. Just ask people at the gas station.\nThere is a shower in fuel station for 3 eur and places for wild camping around.\n\nIf your destination is Venice or further, the easiest way is via Nova Gorica (town on the walkable distance from Gorizia, Italy): use sign GO and ask to be dropped at the service area on the border. For Trieste it doesn\'t work well with TS sign - best option might be to use Koper sign and then ask the driver to drop you off at Kozina exit (go right in the crossroads after toll booths). It\'s only 3 km from the border and on the main Rijeka-Trieste road.\n\nIf your destination is Rijeka, take also rides going to Postojna or further west. Get out at Postojna exit and walk across the highway from there (use the bridge). There is a good spot to hitchhike southwards just few hundred meters after the bridge.\n\n\'\'\'Option 2: Highway entrance Dolgi Most\'\'\'\n\n[[File:DSCI0054.JPG|right|thumb|334px|Hitchhiking spot \'\'Dolgi most\'\']]\n\nFrom the city centre (Dunajska cesta, Slovenska cesta) take the bus number 6, 1, 1D (direction Dolgi most) or 6B (dir. Notranje gorice), to bus stop "Dolgi Most". You will be dropped off on a large parking lot right next to a motorway bridge. There is also a Bicike(lj) (bike rental) station nearby, if you prefer it to taking the bus. On the opposite side of the road, there is a busy motorway entrance with a great hitchhiking spot where cars can easily see you and stop safely.\n\nApril 2024: After the reconstruction the entrance is not as good for hichhiking as before, since drivers need to turn into a "locals only" street. Nevertheless it is still a safe spot with a lot of passing traffic.\n\nSeptember 2024: I was able to get a ride to Postonja from here within 5 minutes in a rainstorm. It looked like a not very ideal spot but it worked. The above mentioned spot in Postonja worked very well for getting towards Rijeka. If you do not feel comfortable crossing the bridge in a sidewalk or shoulder (which I didn\'t want to do in a rainstorm) it\'s possible with a roughly 40 minute diversion to find a pedestrian underpass to the west and then looping down to the above-mentioned spot.\n\n\'\'\'Option 3: Fuel station on the road to highway\'\'\'\n\nNear the crossing of streets: "Pot Na Rakovo Jelšo" and "Barjanska Cesta" there is a fuel station with a lot of cars heading towards Koper.\n\n=== Southeast towards [[Novo mesto]], [[Zagreb]] ([[Croatia]]) {{Aat|2}} ===\n\n[[File:Hhspottowardszagreb.jpg|right|thumb|334px|Hitchhiking spot for direction: Zagreb]]\n\n\'\'\'Option 1: Rest stop Barje - South (Jug)\'\'\'\n\nThis service area is on the Ring around Ljubljana and is very well-served by a lot of long-distance drivers. To get there take a bus number 1 or 1B in direction of "Dolgi most" from the center. Get off the bus on the stop "Mestni Log" and walk back in the direction of the highway. When you reach the overpass look for a very small and steep pathway on your right, starting next to the overpass. Descend down to the fence, turn right and walk a few metres untill you reach an unlocked door. When you\'re on the other side of the fence, you should already be able to see the rest stop. Follow the pathway for another 100 m or so and there you are. There is a shower for 3€, food and places for wildcamping around.\n\n* [[User:MartinJ888|MartinJ888]] August 2022: Works very well. The door is still unlocked! Took us about 1 hour to get a ride, asking people.\n\n*[[User:JackMcJackJack|JackMcJackJack]] August 2023: This gas station and has been demolished and people rarely stop here, avoid this place. The on ramp beside the Lidl on Pot Rdečega križa is a 20min walk away from Mestni Log bus station. Most people here are heading south, but we found a ride to Šmarje - Sap gas station after an hour.\n\nNovember 2024: Reconstruction is finished and the rest stop is open again.\n\n\n\n\'\'\'Option 2: Highway entrance Barjanska cesta\'\'\'\n\nCatch bus 9 in direction of "Barje" from the center or the train station and exit on the final stop "Barje". You can hitchhike next to the parking lot or walk down the "barjanska" street and try to find a better place. That\'s the entrance people from Ljubljana would use to enter the highway going south, so this spot might be less suitable for long distance picks, but perfect to get you to Novo Mesto.\n\n\'\'\'Option 3: Highway entrance Rudnik\'\'\'\n\nNot many cars go in this direction, and the ones that do usually do not enter the motorway here - this on-ramp mostly serves inter-urban traffic, so you might have to wait a bit longer. From the city centre take a bus line 3 in direction of "Rudnik", and get off at the final stop. In front of you there will be the motorway entrance. Cross the street and on the side of the on-ramp road, on your left, you will see a small asphalt surface where all the cars pass, and there you can stand and hitchhike easily. Pay attention that you\'re hitchhiking on the highway entrance (the left turn) and not on the old road (Dolenjska cesta), which is continuing straight ahead. Drivers going to Kočevje and Ribnica use this entrance.\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nLjubljana is a very walkable and cyclable city, so those two are best options to move around. I highly recommend the bike share system \'\'\'Bicike(lj)\'\'\', used daily by many locals. It costs only 1€ for a weekly subscription (and 3€ for the whole year). You can use the bikes unlimitedly 24/7, the 1st hour of every use is free. Definitely the cheapest and most comfortable option, download the BicikeLJ app for use.\nAnother option is taking the busses, payment is possible on the bus with a credit card - one 90 min ride costs 1.3€. In case of credit card payment changing the busses is not possible (every change will cost another 1.3€). Another option is to use the app Urbana or buying the city card.\n\n== Sleeping ==\n\nThe best option in a walkable distance from the city centre would be park Tivoli. It is huge so you can easily find a good place to hide and set up your tent somewhere. People often drink there in the evening so it might be a good idea to sleep in or at least close to the forest, so nobody will bother you.\n\nEdit: if you go to the forest behind Tivoli, be prepared for it is steep. Go there during daylight and plan in enough time to find a suitable spot. If you go until the bag side of the park (just before the forest starts) and go west you\'ll reach a little staircase out of stone.

Get off at the [[Capellen]] stop and walk less than 1 km west to some of the biggest petrol stations in Europe! Walk towards the motorway which you can see from the train station and take the first road right alongside the fields. After 5 minutes you will come to the petrol station fence. You can climb over the locked fence, but the top is spiked. It\'s better to turn right, and walk along the fence for about 250 metres, and climb over it at the first section with a stone-wall. Many truck drivers use this service station.\n\n====Motorway exit for Brussels====\n{{Coords|49.6184|6.0844}}<br>\nFollow the \'\'Route d\'Arlon\'\' to the entry onto the A6/{{E|25}}. This is a walk of about 4km from the town centre. You can also just take the Bus 28 and hop off at \'\'Hondseck\'\', or the Bus 22 and walk from \'\'Maternité\'\' (no need for a ticket ). Cars can pull over just before the traffic lights, or at the sliproad. You can get a ride straight to Brussels, or to the above mentioned [[Capellen]] gas station (\'\'aire de Capellen\'\'), which is just about 10km down the road, and from there you can get rides to about anywhere in Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\n====Service station for Liege and the Netherlands====\nYou have the option of going to the town of [[Martelange]] . This small town is famous for plenty of drivers due to the cheap fuel provided by dozens of service stations for drivers going to the Belgian Limburg, Dutch Limburg, and Aachen, etc. Get train from Luxembourg city station to Arlon. Walk left out of station, keep following the Bastogne road signs towards a roundabout which is a 20 minute walk. Here you can hitchhikin at the junction after the bridge and across from the Fiat car garage. This road goes to Martelange and the North.\n\n=== East ([[Trier]], [[Germany]]) ===\n====The better option====\nJust walk out of the centre to the \'\'Avenue John Fitzgerald Kennedy\'\' in direction \'\'Kirchberg\'\'. You will find many banks, institutes and the Luxembourg fair (LuxExpo) there. You can hitch on every spot where cars can stop on this road and even in side roads and secondary roads which are leading to this avenue. Make sure holding a \'\'Trier\'\' sign. There are masses of people from \'\'Trier\'\' working in Luxembourg Kirchberg and especially on working days you won\'t have to wait long. Hold a \'\'Trier\'\' sign even if you want to get further, if this is the case, you can be dropped at [[Wasserbillig]] service station on the motorway A1 (see The train option). A sign is very important for making the people from Trier stop, which will be your drivers here.\n\nTake the Bus 16 or tram to the stop just before the airport. This stop is next to an entrance to the highway and you can either stand in front of the bus stop with a sign or stand on a little traffic light island at the entrance so that you get all the traffic going towards Trier that is coming from both directions. Get a lift at least as far as the huge petrol station on the border, and then it is easier to hitch further.\n\n====The train option====\n{{Coords|49.7265|6.4921}}<br>\nGet the [[Trier]]/[[Wasserbillig]] (line 30) train from Luxembourg City station. Get off at the Wasserbillig stop. You should turn right outside the train station, walking up the road and turning left up the \'\'Route d\'Echternach\'\' until you reach a crossing beside a big river. This option takes 30 minutes but there are beautiful views to be seen. You will notice that there is an old pathway going up the hill. If you follow this route you should arrive at two old cabins. Turn left at the cabin closest to you and walk further up the hill until you reach another crossing under the massive motorway bridge. Go right at this and keep climbing the hill until you reach a more developed road. Here, you turn right and keep following the access road until you reach the petrol station. This is located at the Luxembourg-German border. There should be plenty of international traffic.\n\n=== South ([[Metz]], [[France]]) (E25/A3) ===\n{{Coords|49.5426|6.1173}}<br>\nGet the line 60 train from Luxembourg City station. Get off at the \'\'Berchem\'\' stop. There are 2 exits from the station. Take the closest one, don\'t take the stairs. And walk less than 2 km to some of the biggest motorway petrol stations in Europe! Take the first little path to the residential area (\'\'Rue Oscar Romero\'\'), pass a tiny roundabout and walk up towards the fields. Then you have a beautiful path through the fields straight ahead. You\'ll pass by generous walnut and apple trees, you\'ll have to climb over small cattle fences, and might say hi to some animals.  Otherwise: Turn left when you leave the Berchem train station, walk down the road 5 minutes and the second main road on the right is \'\'Rue Meckenheck\'\'.  Take \'\'Meckenheck\'\' up winding through a residential area all the way up to where it ends, at which point there is a big forest. Turn right onto Du Bois, and follow it curving around to the left. You should hear the highway and pretty soon you will arrive at a bridge that runs over the highway. Just before the bridge is the south-side petrol station, with loads of cars heading north towards Luxembourg city, Belgium, Netherlands and Germany. \nWalk over the bridge and immediately at the end of it go down to the highway, through the concrete pavement or stairs, and walk 50m alongside of it until the station. \nThere are vehicles traveling all over Europe.  You can also reach the petrol station by hitching from the roundabout that is located right at the start of the highways.\n\n \'\'\'March 2025 update\'\'\': the original bridge over the highway was demolished in 2023 and \'\'the latest Street View imagery\'\' {{Coords|49.5444643|6.1212696|1}} shows the replacement in construction as of July 2024. By now it should be fine and back to normal, it would be lovely if someone could confirm this.\n\n== Hitchhiking in ==\nMany people are driving through Luxembourg without stopping. If your driver is using the A6 (from or towards Arlon, Belgium) you can ask them to leave you at the exit nr 4 (Luxembourg, Strassen). They will drop you at \'\'Route d\'Arlon\'\' and can take the highway right back, and you can take bus 11 or 16 to the city centre at the bus stop "\'\'Hondseck\'\' {{Coords|49.6180218|6.0849528|1}}".\n\nIf you\'re coming from France through the A31 / A3 and the driver will drive on pass Luxembourg city, you can be dropped at \'\'Aire de Berchem\'\'. Walk pass the truck parking to the very end of the gas station where you\'ll find the gate. You can climb over at the edge of the bridge, by the bushes, to make sure you don\'t rip your pants. Then it\'s a 10 min walk, heading southeast, to Berchem train station, two stations away from Luxembourg city.\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n{{IsIn|Luxembourg}}\n[[Category:City\'s]]\n[[Category:Luxembourg]]\n[[Category:E25]]'},

Standing on the motorway junction just before [[Heerlen]] should be avoided, because it is not allowed to stand there. \nWhen heading north on ({{Anl|2}} or {{Anl|73}}) it's allright to start with a simple ''A2'' sign. A great onramp to find a next ride is exit [[Urmond]], taken also by all drivers heading for [[Sittard]]. A sign won't be of help there as drivers are bound for [[Roermond]] or [[Eindhoven]] and all could drop you at the upcoming service stations: ''Shell Swentibold'' or ''Esso Bosserhof''.\n\n=== North towards [[Eindhoven]] {{Anl|2}} {{E|25}}, east towards [[Heerlen]], [[Aachen]] ([[Germany]]) {{Anl|79}} ===\n====Option 1, Maastricht-Centrum Noord====\n{{Coords|50.8580|5.7142}}<br>\nOnramp {{Nnl|2}} ''Maastricht-Centrum Noord'' at the west end of ''Terblijterweg''. Onramp can be reached on foot from ''Stadionplein''. Hard shoulder. \n\n[[File:Tmoon.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[User:Tmoon|Tmoon]] hitching out of Maastricht]]\n\n====Option 2, Maastricht-Randwyck====\n{{Coords|50.8310|5.7196}}<br>\nOnramp {{Anl|2}} ''Maastricht-Randwyck''. Either stand at the onramp, or on the bridge over the A2. There is a hard shoulder. Use sign ''A2'' for going north, [[Heerlen]] for going east. Bus 1 and 2 (direction ''De Heeg'') stop nearby at busstop ''Oeslingerbaan''/''Langendaal''.<br>\nPersonal experience of [[User:Fverhart|Fverhart]]: An average wait of 20 minutes, a sign A2 or A79 / Heerlen helps. Police may send you away here. Easiest way to get on the bridge is from BP petrol station walk behind the safety rail along Oeslingerbaan. \n\n====Option 3, Junction Kruisdonk====\n{{Coords|50.8729|5.7355}} Going north<br>\n{{Coords|50.8723|5.7365}} Going east<br>\nAccess lane of the {{Anl|2}} on the junction ''Kruisdonk'', near [[Rothem]]. Hard shoulder. Bus line 59 or 159 until busstop ''Kruispunt'' in Rothem, then walk south along ''Ambyerweg'' / cycling path for 500&nbsp;meters.<br>\nPersonal experience of [[User:Fverhart|Fverhart]]: despite a lot of space on the access lane waiting times rather long. You can approach cars at the traffic light at the exit lane, many of them are crossing the road and driving up the A2. Everybody can take you to the next petrol station. \n\n====Option 4, Brusselseweg====\n{{Coords|50.8589|5.6717}}<br>\nStand somewhere on ''Brusselseweg''. After [[Maasmechelen]] you get to the N78, wich goes back into the Netherlands and and turns into the {{Nnl|273}}, and meet up with the {{Anl|2}}.\n\n=== East towards [[Gulpen]], [[Aachen]] ===\n{{Coords|50.8421|5.7397}}<br>\nTake the bus #53 or #54 from the center towards ''Akersteenweg''. At this bus stop you'll find a petrol station. There you can try to get a lift towards [[Aachen]] in [[Germany]].  You might have to get a few lifts, village to village, along the {{Nnl|278}} aka ''Cadier en Keer'', but you shouldn't ever have to wait very long. Usually a lift to at least [[Vaals]], which is right before the border and Aachen, is possible. Towards Aachen it may be quicker to go via Heerlen.\n\n=== South towards [[Liège|Liege]] (A2) {{E|25}} ===\n{{Coords|50.8410|5.7161}}<br>\nFollow the rail track from the central station out of the town in a southern direction from the backside exit (use the bridge over the rails). At the first rail/road crossing south of the station hike on over the cycling path and later, still by the side of the railway, over ''Sint Gerardusweg''. Follow this way until the end, thus you walk under a bridge (''John F. Kennedysingel''). This is the junction ''Europaplein''. Keep walking 100 meters ahead to the motorway ramp. Average wait is about 10 minutes, max. 30 minutes. Longer rides are not common. Petrol station between Maastricht and Liège (still in the Netherlands) is not very busy, but can give longer rides into France. Knowing the good spots in Liège to hitch-hike is a good idea.\n\n=== West towards [[Hasselt]], [[Antwerpen]], [[Leuven]], [[Brussels]] (Belgian N2) ===\n{{Coords|50.8551|5.6602}}<br>\nBest place towards [[Hasselt]] is at or just after the traffic lights at the crossing of ''Via Regia'' and ''Canteleerstraat'', the first crossing after the traffic square ''Via Regia''. Expect short rides to [[Veldwezelt]], [[Mopertingen]] and [[Bilzen]]. You will reach the motorway at [[Diepenbeek]] or [[Bilzen]], where you can easily get further. All the motorway access lanes in Hasselt are suitable for either [[Brussels]] or [[Antwerpen]].<br>\nPersonal experience of [[User:Fverhart|Fverhart]]: Average wait of about 10 minutes and you should accept every ride that takes you further on the Belgian N2. Just before Bilzen you can hitch-hike at the roundabout towards Hasselt and further into Belgium.\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n\n[[Category:City's]]\n[[Category:Limburg|Limburg]]\n[[Category:E25]]\n\n{{Cities Netherlands}}\n{{Cities Limburg}}"},

There is a big petrol station with many slip roads, which might look attractive, but the smaller petrol station (on the left side of the road) offers a more convenient spot for drivers to stop, and also allows drivers that don\'t enter the station to pull over.\n====Option 2====\n{{Coords|53.4800|-2.2835}}<br>\nAlternatively, you could keep on walking along Regent Road until you get to the "roundabout" and get to the shoulder on {{Mgb|602}}. Getting there is a little complicated since it\'s not very pedestrian-friendly. Technically, you\'ll be on the motorway, but it\'s right behind a traffic light so traffic goes slow - a police car passed by without batting an eye. Make sure to have a sign, since it\'s not clear which direction you could be going. \n\n===East towards [[Leeds]], [[Hull]] ===\n====Option 1====\nTravelodge Manchester Birch {{Mgb|62}}. Train to Mills Hill - Oldham Rd - Wood S|t - Heywood Old Rd OR Bus to Langley Lane. Walk White Ln (which goes over the motorway M62), and you will be at the Travelodge Manchester Birch M62 , where you can hitch a ride down the M62 to Leeds or Hull. \n\n====Option 2====\nAnother option is to walk down the A56 (Bury New Road) and wait at the exit ramp of the ring road merging with the M60. Alternatively you can take the tram to Prestwich to get there.\n\n=== South Towards Birmingham and Bristol ===\n====Option 1====\nCatch a bus to Whythenshaw  (the 101, 104 or 105 from Piccadilly Gardens in the city centre. Just ask the driver to shout for you at the Wilbraham road junction if you\'re unsure where to get off)  and get to Princess Parkway, this is the start of the M56. From here you can head to the M6, better if you are heading south since you are a few junctions south then if you was on the M602. here you will see a petrol staton immediatley befor the slip road, I\'ve always had a quick ride from here, mainly for drivers filling their cars up, and a bus stop in front of you for cars to pull over safely.\nEDIT: Dec 2016. This seems to refer to the Texaco gas station pretty close to the sliproad to the motorway. When I approached drivers there I was sent away by a member of staff\n\n====Option 2====\nYou don\'t necessarily need to be on the M56. There are a few good spots on the A5103 (Princess Parkway) so depending on where you start from in Manchester you could head to any one of these. I walked down the Wilbraham Road heading west and turned left (south) onto the A5103. 50 m further is a Shell petrol station with fairly good flow /next to Alexandra Park/. Although some of this will be local traffic, a lot is also continuing onto the M56 and then M6. If you don\'t want to wait around at the garage itself, there is a good bus stop just before so you could try some road hitching here. It took 10 minutes getting a ride out to the M6.\n\n====Option 3====\n{{Coords|53.4424|-2.2440}}<br>\nThere is this bus stop. It really is a great place to get south from; I\'ve used it six times and have never had to wait more than 1 hour 15 - but it usually takes much less. One time it only took 90 seconds to get a lift as far as [[Birmingham]].\n\n====Option 4====\n{{Coords|53.3987|-2.2656}}<br>\nAfter trying unsuccesfully to get a ride from the positions mentioned above, I walked to a bus stop at the A560. It is located between two roundabouts, a bit before the roundabout leading on to the M56. There is an exit for an industrial estate in front of the bus stop which a decent amount of space for drivers to slow down and drive over, where I stayed to wait for a driver. Only took me 5 minutes to get a ride all the way to [[Birmingham]]. The Buses 104 and 11A can get you all the way there.\n\n====M56/M6====\nIt\'s useful to know that if someone isn\'t actually going on to the M6 but carrying on to Chester or somewhere further west then it can still be good for you. There is a big service station about 1 mile after the junction between the A556 (Chester Road) and the M6. It\'s called "Knutsford Services". So even if the driver drops you at the junction you could probably stealthily walk the distance or just ask the driver to take you there seeing as it\'s so close.\n\nIf you don\'t want to hitch out of the city, a train to Knutsford costs around £6 and the walk from the train station to the services is around 30 mins.\n\n==Free showers==\nMany University of Manchester buildings have shower facilities for students and staff who commute by bike. Some buildings have access gates which require you to present a student ID - if this is the case say you forgot your wallet at home and the reception staff will ask you to sign in (it\'s just a piece of paper, for student no. make up any 7-digit number that begins with the no. 7). \'\'Here\'s a map of buildings with shower facilities and access restrictions)\'\' {{Coords|53.4684693|-2.2421159|1}}\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n{{nomadwiki}}\n{{Category|City\'s}}\n[[Category:North West England]]\n[[Category:E20]]\n[[Category:E22]]\n{{IsIn|North West England}}'},

Just before the river Rio Tamega, one of the two main rivers of Marco de Canaveses, you will have this ''gas station'' {{Coords|41.18695|-8.15549|1}}. You can easily walk to the gas station located in the Avenida dos Bombeiros Voluntarios do Marco, which is about 800 meters (10 min) from the city centre. From the town hall, you walk Northwest, for about 550m, from Rua de Sao Nicolau street towards Rio Tamega until you get a street on your left called Rua Cruz, the last street before you reach a small bridge passing over Avenida dos Bombeiros Voluntarios do Marco. Take Rua Cruz, walk for 200m and the gas station will be just on your right side when you will reach the main road Avenida dos Bombeiros Voluntarios do Marco.

Tell drivers you are going to Porto through the A4. Many of the cars might be from locals, though many are also going direction Porto. If drivers are going to take the A11 towards Guimaraes, you can ask them leave you at the tolls (portagens) at the entrance of the motorways A4 and A11 (they start in the same place). You can try asking drivers directly when they stop to take the card from the machine. These tolls are located about 10 km from Marco de Canaveses (via the N211).\nThere is a service station on the A4 before Porto, in Aguas Santas.. \n\n==== Option 2: Crossroad near Repsol Gas Station ====\n\nThe location of this option is very close (about 1 km walking) to the location of option 1. See [https://www.openstreetmap.org/directions?engine=mapzen_foot&route=41.1867%2C-8.1552%3B41.1938%2C-8.1546#map=17/41.18914/-8.15181 here]. This serves as an alternative to option 1, and you can perfectly try both as they are so close. Make sure you hitchhike the road going to the left towards the river.\n\n=== South towards [[Aveiro]], [[Lisbon]], [[Algarve]] ===\n\nThe best way to go South is to go towards [[Porto]] (West) in a first instance, using the Repsol Gas Station mentioned earlier. \nWhen on the A4 towards Porto, you can be dropped at the gas station Estaçao de Serviço de Aguas Santas, 2 km before the merge with the A3. \nYou can try to find a lift to a service station south of Porto (Repsol gas station in Gaia, or further south on the A1, Estaçao de Serviço Antuã-Estarreja).

It is usually faster and simpler to go to the A4, like in the previous options, with the road N211. Just 1 or 2 kilometers further east on the A4 you have a big service station. Note that this highway is not a busy one, and you might need some patience (if you're going to Spain and France, this is a way less busy route than the border in Vilar Formoso, near Guarda). \n\n\n== Hitchhiking in ==\nThe best way to hitch in is using the motorway A4 if you are coming from West, South and East, and the A11 if you are coming from the North.

If you are coming from North using A11 take exit 16 for N211 towards Marco de Canaveses.\nYou shouldn't have much trouble finding a lift from the tolls, as most of the drivers will take the road to Marco de Canaveses, or will drive through it. \n\n== Camping ==\n\nIf you want to do wild camping in Marco de Canaveses you have plenty of space and places besides the ones recommended here where you won't be bothered by anybody. \n\nParque de Merendas de Montedeiras is a really nice park located about 8 km from the centre of the town but very easily acceded.

There is the highway North-West A55 that starts there (it\'s a bridge going up so it\'s better to stand at the traffic light just before it). A lot of the cars leaving from that point can take you out of Marseille\'s metropolis and leave you at Fos-sur-Mer, where the road is only one-lane and it\'s easy to get another lift. \n\nMetro to Bougainville station and walk to petrol station called Briançon Métro station (\'\'map\'\' {{Coords|43.3151284|5.3672314|1}}). Place is still in town\n\nTrain to Aéroport Marseille Provence and search for Agip fuel station on A7 highway 1 km away\n\n=== North or West by A7, towards A8, [[Aix-en-Provence]], [[Avignon]], [[Lyon]], or [[Nice]] ===\n\nTest option - Total petrolstation on A50. Go by bus 12 till stop  HLM la Rouguière. Petrol station is 300 metres away\n\n\nYou can stand on the entrance to the [[L\'Autoroute de Soleil]] (A7), 3 minutes\' walk northwest from the central station Gare Saint Charles. From the station main entrance, follow the blue road signs.\nGet a lift to the [[péage]], or the big [[petrol station]] "Lançon" and you\'ll easily get a ride to Lyon, Montpellier or anywhere further.\n\n=== East to [[Nice]] and [[Italy]] and [[Toulon]] ===\n\nIt is highly recommended to first go north via A7 and then take the A8. The alternative - A50 east to [[Toulon]] and then up to A8 - is by far less frequented, since the highway goes directly through the city of Toulon, with traffic lights and speed limits. Stand just before the entrance of the motorway [[Toulon]], Aubagne: boulevard Rabatau, just in front of the Kyriad Hotel or Boulevard Jean Moulin, just after the last trafic light, at the entrance of the motorway which turns on the left.\n\nGood spot is on Bd Vincent Delpuech just before the roundabout where the A50 begins. Nice open space opposite traffic lights with an extra lane for drivers\n\n== Public Transportation ==\n\nThe metro is easy to blackride, walk through the open doors or follow somebody who is walking through the turnstiles with a ticket. People will hold open the doors for you if you have a backpack. If you see security, wait until they look away or go for a cigarette break. Buses are even easier, the drivers don\'t check for tickets and inspectors (very rare, found sometimes around Vieux-Port) wear black-purple uniforms. The amount of purple on their uniforms is just one very thin line across their chest..so you have to look out really well. Trams are easy too, just be careful around the center and you`ll be fine. A lot of people blackride in this city.\n\n== Leave your bags ==\nYou can leave your bags in supermarket LIDL (Rue Sante 71, Monday-Sunday, 9-20:00). I am not sure about other LIDL\'s but in this one it works and it\'s very close to city center. They have big storage boxes, that\'s enough for your big backpack, deposit is 2 Euro. \n\n== Eat ==\nNear Noailles metro station there is a food market with a lot of cheap arabic cafes. I can recommend you somme pizza cafes where you can buy big pizza for 4 Euro. Couple of good pizza cafes you can find on Rue des Feuillants.\n\n== Internet ==\nYou can find computers with internet in the cenral library - Bibliotheque de l\'Alcazar. Also they have free wi-fi, comfortable chairs, tables, sockets and toilet. You can use their wi-fi as much as you want. To use their computers you have 1 hour per each day. You need to make your own card with your personal login and password. To do it, you need any ID.  Working time Tuesday-Saturday, 11-19:00. I managed to use the computers for ~3 hrs/day by closing my session when I had 10-15mins left and then moving to another computer and opening a new session. I always had another 59mins, besides the last time, when it changed to 49mins.\n\nFor a quick check you can also use the computers in Office de Turisme. If you need internet for longer reaserch I recommed going to Les Terrasses du Port, it\'s open everyday from 10.00 am to 8 pm (or even till 1 am - a part with restaurants).\n\n== Sleep==\n\nYou can find a perfect spot to pitch your tent at the green beaches (called in french Parc Balnéaire du Prado) just get the bus number 83 and get off there, you can\'t miss it (and don\'t even think about paying, cause you\'ll be the only one to do that).\nDo not do it on the beach! There are plenty of trees close by, do it there.\nBy the way, the beach strip in this part of the city is probably the best. Good luck! {{hitchbase_city|160}}\n\n\nI stayed at the above spot a few days ago; it really is in many ways a perfect spot. I was not bothered by the police, there is a grocery store (Casino), a cheap kebab place, and a cafe with wifi across the street. There are also public showers (typical outdoor cold water beach showers), which are great. However, be warned that around 4:30 AM, some sprinklers turned on and continued until about 5:30. Also a tractor combing the beach itself in the morning, so if you camp on the sand you will be woken up / run over\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n\n{{Cities France}}\n\n\n{{IsIn|Bouches-du-Rhône}}\n\n__NOTOC__\n\n[[Category:France]]\n\n[[de:Marseille]]\n[[fr:Marseille]]'},

People feel safe there and will easily take you if you want to reach another part of the city or an adjacent one. Moreover, the probability of traveling in a high-standing car is quite high. \n\n== Hitching out ==\n\nInstead of hitchhiking from the city itself, one typically takes a public transportation out to a hitchhiking point.\n\n=== West towards [[Nice]] ===\n\nYou can get a train to [[Nice]] or Saint Laurent du Var.\n\nIf you dont want to take a train to Nice, you can go by walk to the gas station on A8. From Monaco center it took 2.5 walking but it definitely worth it, I got a ride to Barcelona in 30 min. \nIts hard to describe how to got there, and you definitelly will need a map for that. I was using MapsMe app. This is the {{Coords|43.7547|7.3983}} of that gas station. First you need to get to the village La Turbie. Take bus 11, leaving from the tourism office close to the casino, once in an hour, in the direction \'\'La Turbie\'\' and get out at the bus stop "Mont Angel". Then walk up the street "Route de Mont-Angel" for 600 meters, then to the left into "Chemin du Col de Guerre", in maybe 30 min you will reach the bridge above the highway, after 5 min more walking you will reach the gate to the gas station, when I came, almost midnight, it was closed, so I just jump over it. But, I guess, you can ring the bell and someone will open. \nTake in mind that all way from Monaco to this gas station requeries to go UP. So think about whether you need it.\n\n=== East towards [[Italy]] ===\n\nTake bus 11, leaving from the tourism office close to the casino, once in an hour, in the direction \'\'La Turbie\'\' and get out at the bus stop "D 2564/RD 63". From there it\'s around a 10-minute walk to a service station on the highway towards Italy. Follow the street \'\'Route de Menton\'\' eastwards and take the second road left going up the hill, be careful about the cars, the road is narrow and cars are going fast. The bus costs 1.50 € (June 2017).\n \nAnother possibility for leaving in the direction of Italy is bus TAM 100, which goes from [[Nice]] to [[Menton]] on the Italian border. The fare is 1.50 € regardless of the distance. It stops in Monaco at the Place des Armes.\n\nWhen you want to go further to italy *DO NOT* Stay at the peage there, it‘s almost everytime Full of italian border-Police and they will fine or warn you and they will tell you, Thats illegal in Italian to Autostop.\nThe best solution is to use the petrol station right behind Monaco and ask to Drive further than Sanremo because it could be hard before. ( we waited more than 6 Hours and still got nothing, we had to walk there.. ) maybe you will be luckier but its your risk :/.\n\n=== Circuit de Monaco ===\n\nIt is possible to hitchhike the Monaco street circuit, by standing on the start/finish line and sticking your thumb out. \n\nSee how fast you can complete one lap (timed from the moment you start waiting on the side of the road, until the moment the car you\'re in crosses the line). Sanne and [[User:Tmoon|Tom]], hitchhiking as a pair, completed 1 lap in about 9 minutes (we forgot to time exactly) on 10 May 2009. If you are in Monaco, give it a go, time yourself and let the world know how you did! \nElise, Joséphine and [[User:Niko Zo|Nico]], as a group of 3 (challenging) completed it in an hour, in 2023, enjoying 2 rides in gorgeous electric and luxurious cars. Welcome to Monaco. \n\nBetter try it during evenings or weekends, the amount of cars during the days makes you going too slow to reach less than 9 minutes.\n\n== Sleep ==\nOfcourse it\'s better to find a place to sleep in a nearby cities, because it\'s hard to find a good place for a tent in Monaco. I can recommend you one place in Italy, before the French border. If you age going from Italy, it\'s a really only one good place on the way from Ventimiglia to Monaco. Trust me, i made all this way on foot and check everything along the road. Two kilometres before the border there is a tunnel Galleria Mortola, after you pass this tunnel, turn left and you will see railway and the small bridge for pedestrians that cross this raillway. Cross it and you\'ll see nice green area on the rock with amazing view on a night Monaco.\n\nYou can also walk from Monaco toward France, near the Route de la Plage Marquet is the beach it situated near Le Lampar restaurant. I slept there, without using a tent, just in sleeping bag and noone bothered me. At the morning you will got just amazing view. \n\n\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n{{Template:Europe/countries}}\n[[Category:Europe]]\n[[Category:France]]\n{{Category|Monaco}}\n{{Category|City\'s}}'},

There is a petrol station on the road, but a better option seems to be simply walking along the road itself with a sign saying ''NL'', and seeing what happens.

At the ''Dorffeldstrasse'', walk down the road towards the ''Nottulner Landweg'', go left and after around 100 meter go right into the street ''Am Rohrbusch''. Walk towards the bend to the left, but go straight into the little way (you'll find a dead-end street sign), and after some 20 meters you see a way going to the left ending directly on the service station ''Münsterland''. {{Coords|51.9474|7.5506}} Yey, you are there for going south!

Hitching here is fairly easy. There are three so called ''[[liftershalte]]s''.\n\n== Hitchhiking out ==\n=== North towards [[Arnhem]], [[Apeldoorn]], [[Hengelo]] and [[Groningen]] ===\n{{Coords|51.845040|5.873448}}<br>\nAt the verkeersplein near the Waalbrug (direction [[Arnhem]]) there is a liftershalte. this is a hitch-hiking spot as it should be, and you hope it to be. It should be no trouble at all to get to the first gas station on de {{Anl|50}} from where you can easily get to [[Zwolle]] or [[Hengelo]].  Possibly, at the petrol station on the {{Anl|325}} almost everybody is going to Arnhem. \n\n=== East towards [[Germany]], [[Kleve]] ===\n====Option 1====\n{{Coords|51.8452|5.8749}}<br>\nNear the official hitchhiking spot leading north, use the bus stop at the sliproad at this junction in the direction of [[Kleve]]. The road is the {{Nnl|325}}, the street is ''Nieuwe Ubbergseweg''. Don't bother walking further along the N325, there are no further good spots until the German border.\n\n====Option 2====\n{{Coords|51.8232|5.7716}}<br>\nFor further afield in Germany, try the junction with motorway [[A73 (Netherlands)|A73]] in Dukenburg. Okay, it's quite a way out of city centre, and there is little place to safely stop, but this is such a busy entrance, and there are so many cars going long-distance here that it's child's play to get a long ride. Even more so because just before the motorway split between [[A73 (Netherlands)|A73]] and [[A77 (Netherlands)|A77]] is just 15 kilometres south of here, and it has a large service area right before it. So any car going to [[Boxmeer]] or further can pick you up here, and there are many of those. When trying to hitch out towards [[Düsseldorf]], [[Cologne|Köln]] or further, one should use this ramp.\n\n=== South / West towards [[Venlo]], [[Eindhoven]], [[Den Bosch]] ===\n====Option 1====\n{{Coords|51.8416|5.858}}<br>\nAt the ''Graafseweg'' (direction [[Venlo]] and [[den Bosch|'s-Hertogenbosch]]) there is a liftershalte (often used as a parking spot), and many cars passing by are local. Better is to walk down to the intersection of Graafseweg and Neerbosscheweg (about 30 min. walk) and raise sign there. About one-fourth of cars passing here are for destinations in [[Brabant]] and [[Limburg]] province, so waiting times are fairly minimal considering the amount of (slow-moving) traffic and the good place to stop. It's also possible to get bus 2 and 99 here.\n\n====Option 2====\n{{Coords|51.8232|5.7716}}<br>\nAnother spot is there where one should try to get rides to [[Düsseldorf]] or [[Cologne|Köln]] directly at the onramp of [[A73 (Netherlands)|A73]] southbound. It's quite a way out, and there's not a whole lot of space to stop, but the statistics are overwhelmingly in your favour here, at least 50% are going to [[Boxmeer]] or further from here, which means they can drop you off at the [[rest area|service station]] before the [[A73 (Netherlands)|A73]] / [[A77 (Netherlands)|A77]] split. IF you want to take this option, take the bus to ''station Dukenburg'' there are a lot of busses that go there so this should be easy. (If you want to plan your journey to any bus or train station or any location in general use the website 9292.nl This will give a very nicee and clear schedule.) From Station Dukenburg stand with the busstops behind you and the railway to your right and take a right under the tunnel. Take a left at the giant roundabout and from there it is a 10-15 minute walk straight ahead to the onramp. It should take you 20 minutes to get a ride. \n\n====Option 3====\n{{Coords|51.8243|5.7847}}<br>\nThere is a gas station near the onramp (described at option 2) you can ask people here and/or raise sign a couple of metres before the way to the gasstation so they can easily stop there if they want. If you want to check it out: search for ''Wijchenseweg 1, Nijmegen'' om google maps. It took me around 20 minutes to hitch a ride to Venlo from here. \n\n=== West towards [[Rotterdam]], [[Utrecht]], [[Den Haag]] and [[Amsterdam]] ===\n{{Coords|51.8450|5.8734}} Liftershalte<br>\n{{Coords|51.8390|5.7982}} Petrol station<br>\nUse either the [[liftershalte]] near the Waal bridge mentioned in the '''North''' section, or use the petrol station past the ''Neerbosschebrug'' in the ''Lindenholt'' neighbourhood. Take bus 7 for the petrol station, you can see it on your right side if the bus turns into Lindenholt past the bridge. Avoid rides to Arnhem when using the [[liftershalte]], unless it's possible to be dropped off on the right side of Arnhem, if you're familliar with that city. Remember that it's usually much easier to hitch out of Nijmegen than to hitch out of Arnhem, so it doesn't really matter if you turn 3, 4 or 10 rides down.\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n{{Cities Netherlands}}\n{{Cities Gelderland}}\n\n[[Category:Gelderland]]\n\n[[de:Nijmegen]]\n[[nl:Nijmegen]]"},

In buses you will usually need to show a ticket, rarely they check if it\'s valid, but you need to show \'\'something\'\'. Being caught without a ticket will cost you 60€.\n\nBut there is a [https://twitter.com/nbg_ticketfrei Ticketfrei bot in Nürnberg] to sousveill ticket controllers. If someone reported a ticket controller, you should probably buy a ticket. If not, you are probably safe. Read the [https://wiki.links-tech.org/IT/Ticketfrei/use usage guide here (german)].\n\n== Hitchhiking out ==\n\n===A73 and then onto: A9 direction [[Munich|München]], A6 Directions East ([[Prague]]) and West ([[Heilbronn]], [[Stuttgart]]) ===\nThere is the [http://hitchwiki.org/maps/?place=6201 Aral petrol station spot] to get out of Nuremberg onto the A73 at entry/exit "Zollhaus". \nCars will be going onto the A9 direction South (Munich etc.) and onto the A6 in both directions. The spot is Münchner Straße across the road from Burger King, you can get there by taking the bus 65 to "Bayernstraße". \nThere is the exit lane to the petrol station after the big crossroads so cars can stop for you easily. A [[sign]] will probably help, since people here go in many directions. \n\n=== A9 direction [[Berlin]] or [[Munich|München]] from the service station Feucht ===\nIt takes about an hour to get there, but from the [http://tank.rast.de/standorte/suche/detail.html?ID=274 Raststätte Feucht/Nürnberg] (service station) South of Nuernberg you can easily hitchhike North or South along the [[A9_(Germany)|A9]]. You\'ll have to take the S-Bahn for 15 minutes and then walk another 30-40 minutes to the service area. \n\nFrom \'\'Nürnberg Hbf\'\' (the main train station) you take the "S2" to \'\'Feucht\'\'. When you leave the train station you follow "Bahnhofstraße" until you reach a roundabout where you turn right onto "Friedrich-Ebert-Straße".  You follow this street until you reach the "Schwabacher Strasse" where you turn right again and continue straight. You\'ll cross a crossroads where you see a McDonalds on your left. Continue straight on "Schwarzenbrucker Straße" passing an industrial area until the road makes a turn to the left after which you\'ll turn right into "Am Brückkanal" - basically you continue straight. Now walk on straight until you reach the highway and the end of the parking of the service area. For Munich you\'ll have to take the tunnel to the other side, for Berlin you can stay on the side you are on.\n\n=== A9 direction towards [[Berlin]]  ===\nYou\'ll have to take the S-Bahn "S2" towards "Feucht" for 15 minutes until the stop "Fischbach". From there it is about a 2km walk along the expressway to the on-ramp onto the A9 where you can hitch under the bridge. Cars have enough space to stop behind you in the turn. You can also try to catch a ride to the on-ramp at the traffic light next to the station (or possibly onto the highway).\n\n=== A6 Directions East ([[Prague]]) and West ([[Heilbronn]], [[Stuttgart]]) ===\nTake the U1/11 metro to \'\'Langwasser-Süd\'\' (southern terminus). From there walk straight to a crossroad with a traffic light, there turn left, walk along \'\'Liegnitzer Strasse\'\', and then turn right to \'\'Gleiwitzer Strasse\'\'. Total walking distance is about 2 km till you see a bridge in 100 metres after the spot. \nIf you\'re tired or lazy, you can also start hitching at \'\'Liegnitzer/Gleiwitzer\'\' crossing, you risk to wait longer though. There\'s also a bus line going that way, check out the map at the U station. \nWhen you go direction Prague, use a [[signs|sign]] "[[Amberg]]". There will be the [[petrol station hitchhiking|petrol station]] "[[Oberpfälzer Alb South]]" shortly before that city. So it\'s not a bad idea to wait for someone going across the border at the petrol station. \nOtherwise you can go with local traffic from Amberg to the border, hitching from one motorway entrance to another. In this case, you\'re likely to end up at [[Waidhaus]], the last German village before the border. If you were dropped in the village, instead of going back to motorway, you can take local crossing, leading to the town of [[Rozvadov]]. Once the other side, cross the town and about a km further will be a motorway entrance with a huge petrol station.\n\n=== A6 Direction East ([[Prague]]) (alternate method)  ===\nThere is green space to wait just before the "Hans-Kalb-Str." bus stop and the bus stop gives cars space to pullover. There is a traffic light right beforehand so cars will be going quite slow and be able to see you. \'\'maps link\'\' {{Coords|49.43229|11.13169|1}}. Not all the traffic hear is going East as there are a couple highway interchanges to leave the city so a sign is recommended. I held a sign reading "CZ" and got a ride within half an hour to the above-mentioned service station. I have not tried the above-mentioned strategy but I believe this one is good because it is closer to the city-center and traffic volume is quite high, and I saw several Czech license plates. There is also much less walking required as you can take the 44 bus directly to that stop, or take the S-Bahn S2 or S3 to the Frankenstadion stop and walk the very short distance from there\n\n=== A3 direction South-East ([[Regensburg]]), ([[Passau]]) and ([[Austria]]) ===\n\nFrom Nürnberg Hauptbahnhof take the S-Bahn in direction of Altdorf (b Nürnberg) and get off at WEST Altorf. The ticket costs 4.70€ but you can try to get on the train for free since it takes 20 minutes to reach WEST Altdorf. For my part, i haven\'t seen any controllers. From there walk uphill on Fischbacher Strasse for 300 meters, turn right on Schulstrasse Strasse for 300 more meters and turn right again on Nürnberger Strasse. It\'s the Boulevard leading to the A3 motorway going to Regensburg, Passau near the Austrian border and Linz. Walk along the boulevard for 200 meters where you can see BMW and Mercedes centers and until you see the motorway. Walk under the motorway and right after you\'ll see the entrance on your left. The spot is perfect to hitchhike and you can expect to get a lift in less than 25 minutes. Also trucks have more than enough space to stop.\n\n===A3 direction West and North-West ([[Würzburg]], [[Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Kassel]])===\n\nThere\'s a service station called "Aurach" on the A3 between Erlangen and Herzogenaurach.\nFrom train station Nürnberg Hbf you can take a local train or S-Bahn to Erlangen train station, from there on take Bus 287 direction "Westfriedhof" - exit at last but one stop ("Sankt Michael" in Steudach). From there you can easily walk in 10-15 minutes to the petrol station (check spot on the map).\n\n==Sleeping==\n\nIf you dont find any place to crash on you can take subway to the airport, it takes like 30 minutes to get there from centre. There are few really nice spots on benches without armrests, there is also free wifi and bathroom. Nobody bothered me there during night and also there was some other sleeping people. \n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n\n\n\n__NOTOC__\n\n[[Category:Autobahn|autobahn]]\n[[Category:Germany]]\n\n[[de:Nürnberg]]'},

[[Iran]] by sea through the [[ferries in the Persian Gulf]].\n\nHitchhiking in Oman (especially in the more populated north) is quite easy.<br/> - \'\'In fact I found it loads more easy in the south. The north and its people feel a bit more european.. Nevertheless north and south it\'s been the best hitching experience I had anywhere in the world! Some moments a car went by not stopping for me and I was actually stunned that it didn\'t stop, I had forgotten that some people don\'t stop for hitchers! ;-)\'\'<br/>\nLocals are curious about people standing in the middle of nowhere and give you a lift because they want to know what you are doing here. Food is sometimes "included". Most of the petrol stations (as well other places; from embassies to reataurants) have free filtered water on an outside wall, which you can use to refill supplies.\nHitching in the remote areas of Oman is incredibly easy — as soon as a car comes along. If you have to wait more than a few minutes for a car, then the chances that it will stop are very good. Waiting in a spot and then starting to walk when a car comes helps greatly, the Omani are extraordinarily kind people, and will feel obliged to stop and help you out.\n\n\'\'It\'s also possible to hitch the taxi\'s that roam the roads. If you do it right, you can get about 20% of your lifts in free taxis. If you are walking besides the road, turning around and thumbing when a car passes, but not thumbing for a taxi, often they stop anyway. They drive up besides you, and ask you where you are going. Tell them "maafi fluce"(I have no money), and tell them that you are walking to your destination. Often they will let you in for a free ride, it happens quiet often if your walking on the side of the road. And don\'t worry, once your in, they will not then turn around and ask you for money at the end of the ride - Oman\'s taxi drivers are the nicest I\'ve ever found in the world.\'\'\n\nAlthough english is spoken by virtually everyone and most signs are in both languages, learning how to read and pronounce arab letters can be a good idea. People will open up even more at foreigners showing the smallest effort to learn their language. <br/>\n\'\'Many locals were surprised when they noticed me reading arab letters! Sometimes I found it helpful to know pronunciation of letters when trying to say a city\'s name, as with english spellings don\'t tell me the difference between "t" and "T" (and there is one). Arabic Alpha is a free app for iPhone an Android and I found it most helpful of all things I tried.\'\'<br/>\n\'\'It\'s not mine and neither get I paid for saying this. ;-) --Marcel\'\'\n\n== [[Muscat]] ==\nHitching in and around the area of Muscat is more difficult, making up for the ease of the rest of the country. Too much traffic, too many taxis, and the people see too many tourists. They are curious, but often by the time they decide to make a decision they have been swept away by the rest of the traffic. Using the micro-buses inside the city might be a viable option as they only cost 500 baizas (1.25$). Most of them go to the central terminal in the Ruwi area, which is also the terminal for long-distance buses.\n\n\'\'Travelling as a couple or two couples I made a different experience in the capital: Many a times we\'d wait less than 5 minutes and someone curious stops and literally turns into a free taxi, abandoning their own business and driving us where we wanted to go (within Muscat, which still can take more than half an hour) out of hospitality and curiousity.\'\'\n\nMuscat is a pain to get out of, it is an incredibly long, stretched and highly dense city, as all the people live along the coastal strip. One thing to try is finding a small entrance to the main road, and try waving to cars about to enter the highway, tell them you have no money for a taxi, if they could take you to where they are going. \'\'Or tell them that and why you don\'t spend it on transportation, instead of lying. Omanis speak a decent english.\'\' Often times they will take you all the way to where you need to go in the city. As they hardly never see a backpacker, you are more of a novelty than the hordes of retired tourists and ex-pats that crowd the place.\n\n===Hitchhiking out===\n=== Towards [[Sohar]] and the North West ===\n====Option 1====\n{{Coords|23.5695|58.1726}}<br>\nThat is very good place on the intercity highway without taxis \nYou can get here using bus #6 from here: {{Coords|23.5878|58.2485}} or {{Coords|23.6514|58.2043}}. Get off the bus here {{Coords|23.5706|58.1708}} and follow path which will lead you to the mentioned good place on highway.\n\n====Option 2====\nTake a bus(A1 or 1) or taxi to Mabelah. Taxi cost almost same as bus along the main city road, 0.5 Rials from Gubra to Mabelah in 2024. The taxi will stop at this location {{Coords|23.6754|58.1376}} and will not go any further. Now you can take another taxi (0.2 Rials in 2024) to this location {{Coords|23.6835|58.1028}}. Here you can start hitchhiking, this roads has plenty of cars and taxis and leads to UAE border, but most of cars are not going far, so be ready for short lifts.\n\n====Towards Nizwa and Southwest====\nTake Bus #9 and get out in Falaj Al Sham {{Coords|23.5025|58.3318}} or further. It\'s end of city with very little amount of taxis here and hitchhiking here is very easy.\n\n== Southern Oman [[Dhofar]] ==\nThe Dhofar region around Salalah in the south is quite hitchable. Many guest workers (mostly Pakistani and Indians) hitchhike to work there so it is nothing unheard of.<br/>\n\'\'Marcel, 2017: I disagree. In 3 weeks and 3000km I haven\'t seen a single local hitchhiking. Autostop seems to be more known than in Iran, yet also in the south people seemed to wonder how I got to the place where they picked me up.\'\'\n\nIt is recommended to clarify if your lift can take you into the next town, or drop you at a gas station close to the road. The heat is not as bad as in most other places in the Arabic Peninsula, but bad enough. You will still need good sun protection and water as you will sweat a lot. Inside towns or on gas stations though you can usually cool down as most bars, supermarkets and shops offer air conditioning. Due to a special climate the weather is moderate and extremely humid between June and September. It is said that there is a lot of tourism coming to Dhofar in this time to see (\'\'well, or not\'\') the supposedly neverending thick mist covering all Salalah area.\n\nThere are free public toilets, sometimes also including showers, on the beaches west of Salalah. As of April 2010 they were reasonably clean. \'\'\'Al Fasayah\'\'\' is the secret spot in this area and for sure without amenities, given it\'s remoteness. After some 40 or 50km from Salalah towards Yemen there\'s a sign for Fasayah or Fazajah to the left. From there it\'s 10km of hiking down to the beach, enjoy! A skilled and adventurous driver could do it with a 2WD but many locals wouldn\'t even dare in a rented  4x4! \'\'Hitch the Salalah-Yemen street in a pickup or jeep and chances are the driver\'s gonna bring you down to the beach, but be prepared to walk back up on yourself! The mountain panorama is gorgeous and ten times worth it, even if you turn around without going the long way down to the beach. \'\'\n\n==Musandam==\nIf you find yourself in the incredible region of Musandam, hitching on boats between the coastal villages is possible. You may have to pay a fisherman to get you out of Khasab; ask at the long row of moored boats between the castle and the main road. 10 OMR (25$) is a fair price for a ride to the Telegraph Island area, but you can haggle for less, especially if the fisherman is going out anyway.  Then with a little sign language you can hitch a ride for free or cheap between the many villages which are only accessible by boat. There is a large population of Pakistani expats who are truly hospitable. \n\nI didn\'t hitch on the roads in Musandam but it\'s probably the same as the mainland, if not easier thanks to the large numbers of Pakistanis and western tourists in 4x4s.\n\nThe castle in Khasab gives away free maps of Musandam with decent detail.\n\n==Visa info==\n\nOman has a \'\'\'common visa facility\'\'\' with [[UAE]]. If you obtained your UAE visa in [[Dubai]] airport (probably also when coming by [[ferry]] to Dubai, not [[Sharjah]]) and it is still valid for at least 3 weeks; then you can get a 3-weeks free visa for Oman. \'\'\'ONLY if you asked for an extra stamp at the airport/ harbor where you enter the emirate of Dubai!\'\'\' \'\'I entered UAE by ferry in 2017 and at the Omani border an officer told me free Omani visa gets only who declared upon entering Dubai that he or she wants to go to Oman and got an extra stamp from Dubai\'s officer.\'\'\n\nIt\'s only the countries mentioned on this site that are benefiting from this: [http://www.rop.gov.om/english/dg_passport_visa_dubai.asp]. What that website does not mention though, is that this is ONLY possible if you \'\'\'go through the [[Hatta]] border\'\'\' (I hitched from [[Dubai]] down to [[Al Ain]] border, only to get the information that I had to go through [[Hatta]]). You still need the exit-stamp from [[UAE]], even though you want the 3-weeks free visa.\n\nThe price of the "normal" visa has increased and there are many websites that provide the old (cheaper) price. Check this website for the correct prices: [http://www.rop.gov.om/english/dg_passport_visas.asp]\n<br/> In 2017 it was 5 Omani Rials (12.5$) for ten days, extendable by ten days in police offices dealing with immigration and visa. 30 day visa costs 20 Rials (50$) and is extendable as well. Extensions are only possible \'\'\'for the same amount of time and same price\'\'\' as original visa and time probably starts counting the day you\'re extending it. So going to immigration offices two days after you entered Oman is a waste of money.<br/>\n\'\'In Salalah the process took 3 hours including waiting time and one hour spent at a copyshop not far from the immigration office where we needed to get an official letter stating our wanting to get a visa extension.

When they grasped the idea, some wanted to make an additional way of 300 km just to bring me closer to my destination. Many people also just stopped for me out of curiosity. I had sometimes a hard time to find out where they go to and often ended up to have lift just for a couple of kilometres (being dropped at a bad spot). Further, I never used public transport in the cities as I found it easy to hitchhike there as well. Many people speak English. There are petrol stations along the motorways. No payment was expected for lifts. Great hospitality.\n\n===Marcel===\nI hitched a hundred thousand kilometers on this planet and Oman beats it all. Yes, part of it may be since I like arabian culture, but there\'s more to it. People, especially in the southern half, are so warm and hospitable, simply want to help where they can and satisfy their genuine curiousity, \'\'while\'\' actually remaining respectful. In some other places on earth I\'ve met a massive hospitality, that however was bigger than freedom of both host and guest. In Oman I (male...) felt accepted and tolerated and no one seemed to try to force their culture/mind/thought-of-what\'s-right-and-wrong on me. <br/>\nThe country\'s safe and clean (even kinda proper and made up here and there), wildcamping wasn\'t a deal at all. Weather will be \'\'\'very\'\'\' hot in summer, best time temperaturewise is November through February/ March.\n\n===Martin===\nI landed in Dubai and got a stamp for free since they now have an agreement with Schengen citizens. I then hitchhiked from there to the Hatta border in Oman and I got a free 21-days visa on the border. However, you first have to get out of UAE and cross the border checkpoint where you\'ll have to pay something like 7 euros. I think they give it back to you if you keep the paper and go back to the UAE but I\'m not sure since I then took a plane from Oman. \nThat was in January 2018 and it was really easy. The border officers were interested in my trip from France to India hitchhiking. \nThere are a few kilometers between the UAE border and the Omani border. Try to get a car before the UAE border or just catch a truck in between! Enjoy Oman, really nice place to travel and meet local people.

 'Paris': {'text': '{{Hitchhiking Zine nomination}}\n{{Infobox Location\n|country = France\n|state = -\n|map = <map lat="48.864716" lng="2.349014" zoom="9" view="3"/>\n|pop = -\n|motorways = -\n}}\n\n\'\'\'Paris\'\'\' is the capital of [[France]]. It is situated within a ring road called \'\'le périphérique\'\', or \'\'le périph\'\'. The actual city is relatively small, but is surrounded by endless suburbs, which are linked to the urban public transportation system at no extra cost, as since January 2025 the Metro and the RER (suburban trains, not to be confused with Transilien trains) have a unified fare system.\n\nNote that there is an "outer ring road" to the Paris suburb area, motorway A86 (or \'\'super-périphérique\'\') and another wider ring even further called "la Francillienne" which isn\'t completed but still used to connect . If your ride is not going to Paris itself, you might want to clarify which ring they are going to take as it may affect the place where you\'d want to be dropped. You may also find them useful if you need to bypass Paris, especially the Francilienne, as it has more gas stations and less complex interchanges.\n\nGood to know if you\'re starting to stink up in the City of Lights: the Municipality provides [https://www.paris.fr/pages/les-bains-douches-municipaux-138 free shower facilities ] in 17 locations around Paris. Note they are BYOT (bring your own toiletry).\n\n[[File:888_signs.jpg|thumb|240px|right|A small collection of the "Paris" signs for the [[Project 888]] where over 150 hitchhikers gathered and camped in front of the Eiffel Tower.]]\n\n== Hitching in ==\n\nDuring rush hours, it is possible (but illegal) to be quickly dropped on the ring road. This is useful if your ride is not willing to get out of it to drop you (which is often the case). Within the ring area, you are definitely linked to the whole regular fare subway system.\n\nIf you are coming from the Northeast and your ride is heading South (which is a normal truck route), chances are that your driver will not drop you on the ring road where it is complicated to stop. A frequent place to get dropped is the first exit South on the A6 called "Rungis". From there, you can reach the Metropolitan subway system by tram with one ticket, then use another one to your final destination. You can also reach other suburbs in the 94 department (Val de Marne) taking the TvM bus, which is also a normal Paris ticket.\n\n== Getting around ==\n\nIf you need to use the Metro and don\'t want to pay for an ever more exorbitantly priced ticket (€2.50 now!): [https://paris-luttes.info/IMG/pdf/bahalorspageparpage-2.pdf here] is a detailed guide on blackriding. It\'s in French but here are some main takeaways:\n* An easy way to get in is to stand in front of an exit gate and reach your arm to the sensor on the other side to trigger its opening (as illustrated in the guide)\n* Otherwise, the main types of entrance gates are:\n# Turnstile with a half-gate behind it: wait for someone to pass so that the half-gate is open and is slowly closing, jump over the turnstile or sneak under it, go through the space left open (easier if you\'re skinny)\n# Short glass doors: literally just push them forward with a bit of force. Genius move by the RATP who are expanding this type to more and more stations.\n# Tall glass doors: these are tricky. Find another type or use an exit gate.\n* Be careful to avoid busy stations with 3 lines or more (Châtelet, République, Nation, the main train stations, etc) as ticket inspectors tend to concentrate there, but you can get always get a bad surprise. They congregate at corridor angles where they can\'t be seen ahead of time, so keep an eye out for foot traffic that is slowing in front of you, or voices saying things like "contrôle des titres de transport, s\'il vous plaît".\n\nThe same goes for RER trains, with two main differences: ticket inspectors tend to actually get on board of them, and you are supposed to use your ticket in order to go through the exit gates.\n\n== Hitching out ==\n\nThere are plenty of excellent spots for hitchhiking North (\'\'Aire La Courneuve\'\'), East ([[petrol station hitchhiking|petrol stations]] and \'\'[[péage|barrières de péage]]\'\') and also South (\'\'Aire de Lisses\'\'). It\'s all about how much you are willing to pay in public transportation, and how daring you are.\n\n=== North/Northeast towards [[England]], [[Lille]] and [[Belgium]] {{afr|1}} ===\n\nThese are classified by cost in public transportation from Paris\' centre.  There is a bonus pro-tip at the bottom involving Arras :)\n\n==== Option 1: Porte de la Chapelle ====\n\nThis option costs one local ticket. Porte de la Chapelle is where the A1 starts. Local drivers say they often see hitchhikers there. To get there, take the metro line 12 to Porte de la Chapelle, then walk to the roundabout. You can try getting a ride on the roundabout (there are traffic lights, which means that cars have to stop) or you can stand on the opposite side facing the roundabout where the motorway starts. Another good option is to start hitchhiking in the same street where the metro is. There are 2 petrol stations in that very street, just 50m deeper into the city. They aren\'t overcrowded and, at the same time, quite a few cars going up north stop here to refill; nonetheless, at such places, much depends on your luck, and according to some hitchhikers, this place won\'t make it to the top 10 best hitchhiking places in France. It is therefore recommended to hitchhike at the roundabout, where a quiet lane right by the traffic lights gives you a good opportunity to get onto the motorway (avoiding at the same time all the traffic that heads for Boulevard Peripherique).\n\nA good option to leave faster is to show at the roundabout a sign for the airport Charles de Gaulle. There is a petrol station (Aire La Courneuve - see Option 2) before the airport where the driver could let you out; don\'t miss it! The station is not so big and many drivers just go to the airport but at least you can ask people, whereas it could be hard and long at Porte de la Chapelle.\n\n==== Option 2: Motorway services Aire La Courneuve ====\n\n[[File:Masaru.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Hitchhiker Masaru at \'\'Aire La Courneuve\'\']]\n\nThis option costs one local ticket or zones 1–3 ticket (eur 2.75as of 2018). The petrol station Aire de Service de La Courneuve is about 2\xa0km along the A1, north of Paris. \n\nTake bus 150 from Porte de la Villette or bus 250 from Fort D\'Aubervilliers (both are on metro line 7) to the stop Parc Des Sports. \nThis bus stop is next to the A1 highway. Just walk to the right from the bus stop, without ever passing under the overpass. Then walk east parallel to the motorway through the parking lot of an apartment complex. There is a wall preventing access to the motorway, but if you continue walking a few hundred meters east and up a slight grassy hill, the wall ends. You can then follow a steep, thorny path full of nettles down towards the motorway and back west towards the petrol station. There is a fence right along the motorway, but near the petrol station it has been trampled down and you can step over it. (The hole in the fence is still here in february 2025.)\n\nYou may need to climb the fance \n\nFrom the petrol station, most drivers are only going to the airport or local communities. You should ask for a lift at least to the toll station (\'\'péage\'\') heading north. This is a 20-minute drive down the motorway (some kilometers after the airport) and everyone has to stop here.\n\nIn february 2025 there were indeed almost just local drivers, with many people going to Orly airport. There were few people going to Creil, which is a good options as there is another Aire/Motorway services on the way.\n\n==== Option 3: Charles de Gaulle ====\n\nCharles de Gaulle airport can be an option for hitching North-East, although waiting times might vary a lot.\n\nIt is easy to jump the metro at terminal 2 and there wasn\'t anyone guarding it. Maybe the same is true for terminals 1 and 3 but I can\'t vouch for it.\n\nFrom terminal 2 walk out of terminal and head straight to the main road. You should see signs for A1 Paris Lille. Keep following these signs until the road splits for A1 Lille. One road goes to the left, under a bridge and there are some traffic lights. The other goes to the right. Stand to the right of the right turn. Cars can stop on a dashed out area to your left or drive a little past you on the right. A couple of cars stopped straightaway and I was easily able to get a lift to the next service station which had lots of people driving north to Lille, Belgium and Holland. \n\n==== Option 4: Motorway services Aire de Vémars Est====\n\nFrom Nation bus station (also a metro stop) take bus 351 to Roissypole located at Charles De Gaulle Airport Terminal 3. It\'s the last stop and payment isn\'t required to enter the bus.You can BLACK RIDE on this bus both ways\n\nFrom the coach station there Gare Routière you can catch the 95.01 bus to Vémars. Ask inside at the ticket office/information desk for which parking number the bus will be at. The ticket costs €2. [BEWARE this bus does \'\'\'not\'\'\' run on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays / so if that is the case, then get off at Quebec because the A1 highway going to Lille cuts through Paris multiple times and at this petrol station there is a higher chance of finding Dutch cars stopping and giving you a ride to another petrol station on the main highway, which is super busy and easy to find rides going to anywhere from Calais to Antwerp to Lille]\n\nUpdate\nAs at Saturday 1 July 2023\nThe parking lot for the bus 95.01 is F1,and the bus does run on Saturdays also,according to the time table and confirmed by the driver \n\nYou can always try to go with the bus number 702 to Vémars centre from the airport (20 stops, 39 minutes). This will also work on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays. The parking lot for the bus 702 is B2.\n\nFrom the Vémars bus stop walk straight 400m on Rue Pierre Curie (D17) until it merges with Rue De la Mairie. Walk an additional 350 m until this merges with Rue Des Vignolles (D16)\n\nOn your left, the A1 will be clearly visible as will the Aire de Vémars Ouest petrol station. From here, it is another 1.25km to any given entrance.\n\n==== Option 5: Porte de Bagnolet (A3) ====\nGoogle maps: [{{Coords|48.8649082|2.4086197}}]\nGet a ticket for the station Porte de Bagnolet. This is pretty close to where the A3 starts, which leads to the A1, so a lot of traffic is heading this direction. The place might not be ideal, but it worked. There is a bus stop, where buses often stop so the traffic is slowed down, furthermore, there is a small gas stop, where you can approach drivers directly which cue up there from time to time. Position yourself at the traffic lights before the bus stop to show your sign indicating the direction you want to go to.\n\n\n==== Bonus Tip: Arras Service Station====\nHeading north on the A1, there is a fantastic AUTOGRILL Aire de Wancourt Est service station just outside Arras [{{Coords|50.2619333|2.8593804}}], with people heading pretty much everywhere.  You can get rides to the UK (Chunnel), Lille, Belgium, Netherlands.  Many difference license plates (GB, F, B, NL, D, E) and lots of opportunities.\n\n=== East towards [[Metz]], [[Strasbourg]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Germany]] {{Afr|4}} ===\n\n==== Option 1. From within the city limits: Quai de Bercy ====\n\nCheap, as you will only need a metro ticket and pretty fast too.\n\nYou can also try to hitch directly from within Paris rather than taking the train for at least half an hour and then walking. \n\nTake the metro line 14 to Bercy and exit towards Boulevard de Bercy, take the Boulevard down to the bridge where it intersects with Quai de Bercy. Standing on Quai de Bercy it is advisable to have a sign indicating you want to get onto the A4. When cars stop, ask if they are going all the way to the toll station (péage), many drivers turn off the A4 before that but there are not really any convenient places to continue hitch-hiking from before the toll station.\n\nUpdate:\n- currently line 14 is not working\n- standing anywhere on the street following the direction of the arena (south east) is not really recommended, instead walk to the bridge Pont Charles de Gaulle: use a sign „A4“ and wait on the Quai de la Rapée just nearby the bridge, there is also space for cars to stop -> get a lift to the last petrol station before the toll station\n-> A lot of cars from Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and France are stopping here (some going to or coming back from Disneyland ;))\n\n\n\n==== Option 2. Motorway junction slip-road ====\n\nThis one is close to Paris, faster and cheaper to get to, but still in the megapolis. Starting from there, you\'re likely to end up either at the petrol station described below or at the péage. Not good at night.\n\nTake the RER Line A (Red) in the direction of Boissy St Legere until the station Nogent Sur Marne. Leave the station in direction of Rue Joinville and follow the sign to the A4. It is a 30 minute walk. There is a red light before the slip road (on-ramp). Lots of traffic, possibility to stop on the ramp for brave drivers.\n\nAsk if your driver can take you at least to the next petrol station Aire De Ferrières which is within the free motorway network. Gare de Péage de Coutevroult toll gate is a bit further.\n\n==== Option 3: Motorway service station Aire De Ferrières ====\n\nTake RER A to station Bussy-Saint-Georges. You can also get to this RER A station by taking bus 4 or 44 from metro station Gutenberg. Walk 2 km Avenue Marie Curie till Rue Pavée turn down until street crosses A4 highway and after this turn left rest stop is next to you. Right side from there is Decathlon Logistics France if you get lost\n\n\'\'\'ATTENTION\'\'\' \nThe bridge leads into the forest and getting onto the motorway might be a bit difficult, the reason being that you have to squeeze yourself to be able to pass through the narrow space between the bridge and the fence.Moreover,you have to descend onto the motorway through an overgrown grass.An alternative is to take bus 46 \xa0at Busy-Saint-Georges station in the direction of Gare de Val d\'Europe,or same bus at Gare de Val d\'Europe in the direction of Torcy(this is important because the bus is infrequent and might be useful to catch it at the other side if wait time is long).From Bussy-Saint-Georges you\'ll ride 4 stops and from Gare de Val d\'Europe, 5 stops,alight at Bout Pêcheret and walk back in the direction the bus came from if you took it from Bussy-Saint-Georges and vice-versa. Continue walking on the [[D10]] road to cross the motorway and turn right on the road leading directly to the service station.\n\n=== Getting South or Southwest {{Afr|6}}, {{Afr|10}}, or {{Afr|11}} ===\n\nThese spots are close enough to the city to be getting traffic in all southern directions.\n\n==== Option 1: Porte d\'Orléans ====\n\nOnce the most famous hitchhiking spot in France, this spot isn\'t bad nowadays, but it isn\'t great either. The good thing is that drivers aren\'t surprised to see people there, and that you don\'t need to get out of Paris in faraway suburbs. \n\nPorte d\'Orléans is the terminal subway station of line 4. There is an entry on the \'\'périphérique\'\' ring road where lots of people are later heading South. The best place is besides the "Novotel" building or (better) opposite it at the traffic lights. Be warned, traffic here is heavy and fast moving. If you have much baggage or more than one person I would not fancy your chances here.  Waiting at the petrol station or even the adjacent war memorial will not give you the best traffic.\n\nNote : I think that the place in front of the hotel is pretty bad. Very hard for the cars to stop there. It\'s better to stand before, at the red lights. I stood near the gas station at the lights, you miss all the cars not coming from inside Paris, but it\'s way easier for the cars to see you and to stop.\n\nMake sure to specify with a sign specifying that you go to Orléans or Chartres (if you are heading Southwest - A10 or A11), and that the driver will leave you at least at the péage de Saint Arnoult or before that at Limours-Janvry service station. Beware, just after the "péage", the motorway separates between A10 and A11. If you are heading directly South onto the A6, have a sign (you may try Lyon or Fontainebleau) and make sure to be left at Aire De Lisses rest stop, roughly 35 km further, a little bit after Evry (drivers to Evry are not enough for you).\n\n==== Option 2: Porte d\'Italie ====\n\nSimilarly Porte d\'Italie which is not far from Porte d\'Orleans is a good place to hitch from. Additionally if you walk down the exit to the traffic lights, there is an overhead bypass which can keep you dry in the rain.\n\n=== South towards [[Lyon]], [[Marseille]], [[Barcelona]], [[Italy]] {{Afr|6}} ===\n\n==== Option 1: Motorway services Aire De Lisses ====\n\nThis option costs EUR 5.85 (but possible to have ride without ticket also), a zone 1–5 ticket and takes roughly 75 minutes. Aire de Lisses is the first service area on the A6, situated about 35 km South of Paris. It can save you time because you avoid all outbound traffic not really heading your direction, being located after all the motorway branch-offs.\n\nGet the RER D towards Melun via Corbeil. Be careful to get on the right train as there are 2 routes for RER D towards Melun. Tthe ID of the train you need was ZIP or ZOP (All trains on RER lines have a 4 letter ID depending on stations served). If it\'s too confusing get whatever train that goes to Corbeil Essonne and from there, whatever train that goes to Melun. Get off at the station Gare de Villabé the second after Corbeil-Essonnes. \n\nOtherwise, you can take the RER D to Évry-Courcouronnes Centre, and from their Bus 415^ in direction of Villabé. Get off at stop Ikea the gas station will be a five minute walk away. There is a fence that it looks like you’ll have to climb from the road, but a goat trail to its immediate right leads to a section of the fence that has been removed and allows access to the rest stop.\n\n^NOTE: As of October 2024 there is construction at the Évry-Courcouronnes Centre Station, specifically the upper-floor bus bays from where the 415 will usually depart. There is no signage directing you to its correct bus bay (and asking an employee in broken French led first to //very// erroneous directions for [[User:Movethathoof|Movethathoof]]). It is supposed to depart from Bay G, to the far right against the concrete wall as seen when exiting the station and facing the surface bus loop. An alternative bus to take is the 4307, departing from the Bay D, which will leave you across the D26 from the IKEA.\n\nNote: There is no barrier at Villabé and so you can pay the standard central Paris fare to get into the metro network and then just ride out there.\n\n==== Option 2: Motorway services Aire de Nemours ====\n\nYou can take a train to Nemours Saint Pierre (transilien R from Gare de Lyon, a ticket costs about 10 euros) and walk 45min to the AUTOGRILL Aire de Nemours A6 service area / Shell fuel station. Then you\'re already on a paying section (no local traffic), far out from Paris (80km), and can get a ride to Châlon, Mâcon or Lyon in a few minutes.\n\n\n=== South-West to [[Orléans|Orleans]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Spain]] {{afr|10}} & West to [[Le Mans]], [[Nantes]], [[Rennes]], [[Bretagne|Brittany]] {{afr|11}} ===\n\nThe A10 and A11 motorways follow the route of the \'\'\'A6\'\'\' (see above) from Paris, and split from it near Antony/Rungis. Then, before the A10 and the A11 split up, there is the service station of Limours-Janvry near Briis-sous-Forges and a [[péage]] near St-Arnoult, 40 km Southwest of Paris. Whichever spot you choose, ask the driver to take you at least until the Limours-Janvry service station or the péage of St-Arnoult. From these places, you can find a driver who takes you on the A10 or the A11 depending on which way you want to go.\n\n==== Option 1: Pont de Sevres ====\n\n[[File:ParisOut.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Hitching after the bridge]]\n\nThis option costs the price of an underground ticket. It takes you to the beginning of the N118 road which connects to the A10-A11 in about 25 km.\n\nTake the subway 9 to Pont De Sevres, its end station. You start walking towards the bridge, where you can see the signs towards Nantes, Bordeaux, etc. The hitchhiking spot is just before the bridge, at the red lights. You can try with the cars coming from the direction of the metro station, and also with the cars which came along the river and are turning left to get to the bridge.\n\n==== Option 2: Motorway junction Massy Palaiseau ====\n\nThis option costs Eur 4.90, a ticket for zones 1-4. This option is useful to get out of the ring roads and get directly on the A10 after all the branch-offs.\n\nTake RER B to Massey-Palaiseau station. Walk down Avenue Carnot along the Massy-Palaiseau railway towards the \'\'autoroute\'\'. After a while there you will see a long stretch of a road with lots of space for cars. Keep going and you will reach a roundabout. If you keep following this road, you will reach the  motorway entrance underneath a bridge. Make sure to get a ride to the first \'\'barrière de péage\'\' (30+ km) at St-Arnoult or to the Limours-Janvry service station 5 km down the road.\n\n\'\'\'Edit July 2022\'\'\' this does not work! There is pretty much zero car traffic, at least when I was there. If you\'re starting in Massy-Palaiseau you\'re better off thumbing at [https://goo.gl/maps/bbD5WGkiKeFqSFzBA this roundabout]. I didn\'t wait too long here and got a ride straight to Le Mans.\n\n==== Option 3: Motorway service station Limours-Janvry ====\n\nThe first service station on the motorway is called Limours-Janvry and it is situated 2kms northeast of the village Briis-sous-Forges. To get there you need to take RER B to Massy-Palaiseau. From there take bus 91.03 to Briis-sous-Forges. It runs about 3 times an hour on weekdays, once an hour on Saturdays, and there are no buses on Sundays. Then walk northeast along the small local road Route D\'Invilliers.\n\nBriis-sous-Forges to the petrol station [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=D131&daddr=Aire+de+Service+de+Limours-Janvry&geocode=FT3X5QIdxnEgAA%3BFZke5gIdK7wgAA&hl=en&mra=ltm&dirflg=w&sll=48.64455,2.16575&sspn=0.115917,0.338173&ie=UTF8&ll=48.626839,2.135124&spn=0.028989,0.084543&t=h&z=14  map]\n\n\n==== Option 4: Péage de Saint-Arnoult ====\n\nYou can take the RER C train to Dourdan. There are no controls on the exit, so if you are on the cheap, you need to pay only the basic metro ticket (some EUR 1.33) to get into the underground network in Paris. Once in Dourdan, cross the railroad track and turn left and then go straight on the D836 until you reach the péage after 4-5 kilometers. You should be able to hitch a car as there are many passing by and the French take easily on small routes if they see you walking. Get off just after the road crosses the autoroute, go left and in a short while, you will reach the péage. Look at the map beforehand! You have much higher chances here then anywhere else, there are lots of cars going through.\n\n=== West towards Rouen, Le Havre, Caen {{Afr|13}} ===\n\n==== Inside Paris ====\n\nQuai André Citroën, under the ring road overpass. A lot of traffic on Fridays and Saturdays as many inhabitants of the 15th and 7th arrondissements go to Normandy for the weekend. As a result, this spot is very effective on these days (20 to 30 min on average) but much worse at other times (expect to wait one and half hours).\n\nPorte d\'Auteuil, at the last traffic light to the entrance of the A13, or even right under the "no pedestrians" sign on the shoulder to the motorway just after the light, where cars haven\'t picked up much speed yet and can see you well.

 'Perth (Australia)': {'text': "{{Infobox Location\n|country = Australia\n|map = <map lat='-32.070938' lng='115.817871' zoom='8' view='0' float='right'/>\n|state = Western Australia\n|pop = \n|plate =\n|motorways =\n}}\n__TOC__\n\n'''Perth''' is the capital city of Western [[Australia]]. It's a great, chilled out alternative to the bustling cities of the east coast, with a great original music scene and some beautiful beaches. The travelers, gypsies and vagabond mecca of Perth is the small port city of [[Fremantle]], located about 30km from the CBD on the coast. (''CBD'' means Central business district, the Ozzie term for city center). Bear in mind that anywhere north of Perth is getting into desert country. Take plenty of water and know where you're going!\n\n# Residents\n\nThese hitchhikers are currently located in Perth, and may be willing to offer tips or accompany you on your first hitchhike:\n\n* https://hitchwiki.org/en/User:Balupton\n\n== Hitchhiking out ==\n\n\nGetting out of Perth is easy. The people in WA are generally more relaxed, friendly and trusting than folks on the east coast, which makes it a great place to hitchhike. Whether it's a short trip around the South-West forests and beaches, a full blown stint across the Nullarbor to Adelaide or an escape north to Broome or Darwin for the winter, it is usually less than half an hour's wait until your first ride out of Perth. As with any city, the trick is to get as far out of town as you can using the local public transport (Perth has a train network that will take you to within cooee of all the good hitching spots). Once you're at the spot, it's usually just a hop, skip and a jump or the straight and narrow to your next destination. Check out Perth on the [http://maps.hitchwiki.org Hitchwiki Map] for some good spots.\n\n\n=== To Southwest Region (Bunbury, Busselton, Margaret River, Pemberton) ===\n\nTo get down to the southwest along the coast, take the train from Perth to Mandurah (if leaving from Fremantle, catch the 99 bus to the Murdoch train station and go to Mandurah from there). Once in Mandurah, walk out of the station and catch the 594 bus south at B4 platform (you can use the same ticket you had on the train) to the Miami Bakehouse (just ask the driver). They have really good pies, and there is a great hitching spot only about 500m south on the highway, with a big pullout onto some gravel.\n\nNote: They recently opened the Perth-Bunbury highway extending from the freeway, which means there is less traffic heading through Mandurah, however I have hitched it since the opening, and still only waited 20 minutes for a ride!\n\n\n=== South to Albany ===\n\nTake the train all the way to Armadale. From Armadale train station, walk about a kilometre up the hill to the Albany Hwy/Southwestern Hwy junction (also a good alternative to get south to Bunbury via Pinjarra/Harvey along the Southwestern Hwy if you wanted). Walk about 200m up the Albany Hwy until you get to the small pulloff before the hill. See [http://maps.hitchwiki.org map] for exact spot.\n\n\n=== North ===\n\nThis will be a big hitch, no matter where you're headed. It can take 3-4 days to get to Broome in a car. Trucks will probably be a better option. Whether your first stop is Geraldton on the coast, or Meekatharra (I hope it isn't!) on the inland highway, it will be at least 5-6 hours, possibly more, before you arrive anywhere. Take plenty of supplies (food, water...etc) and be prepared to start out early, or not at all. \n\n'''Option 1'''\n\nTake the train all the way to Midland. Then catch either the 310 or 311 bus and ask the driver to drop you at the big truck stop. These buses only leave early in the morning (around 8am), so make sure to check on the [http://www.transperth.wa.gov.au Transperth Website] for the timetables and get there early so you don't miss them! Plenty of trucks and cars fuel up at this stop, and there's even a good spot to stand on the road (if there is two of you, one can be asking at the servo while the other is thumbing on the road). You'll need to find out if your ride is heading up the coast (Brand Hwy), or inland (Great Northern Hwy), as these are two very different routes. If you just want to get north quick (to [[Broome]] or [[Darwin]]), try to get rides in trucks heading up the Great Northern, as this will cut a few hundred kilometres off the trip, however if you want to take the scenic route up the coast (Monkey Mia, Coral Bay, Exmouth) make sure to get in with someone heading to Geraldton.\n\n'''Option 2'''\n\nIf you want to hitchhike along the coast, you can try to start at State Route 60. Take a train to Clarkson (the most northern stop of the Joondalup line) and change for bus 484 going to Alkimos and hop off at Ridgewood Bvd After Hester Av (7 stops, I believe). Walk back 200 m to the main road passing by a petrol station on your left, turn left and follow the main road for 1.5 km until you reach State Route 60. Turn right and after 100 m there should two fairly busy petrol stations. I (single male) didn't have any problems to get a lift to the pinnacles or Jurien Bay. To be explicit: ''map'' {{Coords|-31.6773663|115.7193686|1}}.\n\n\n=== East toward [[Kalgoorlie]], [[Adelaide]], [[Sydney]] ===\n\n[[File:03052013432.jpg|thumb|350px|The hitching spot on Great Eastern Highway toward [[Adelaide]]]]\n\nAlso a big hitch, be sure to take plenty of water and supplies if you will be camping. In winter it does get cold at hitchhiking at night in the desert. (Even though you've never seen it be cold in Australia on the TV, it does happen. Don't tell anyone.) If you're heading for the east coast the quickest and comfiest option is with a truck if you can get one who isn't prohibited from giving lifts, one who maybe owns his own truck.  You can have good luck with this just by thumbing on the roadside, as well as talking to the driver at a servo (service station) or truck/rest stop (these can be quiet though).  Most trucks are carrying things to be delivered by Monday morning at their destination, so the busiest times for them leaving Perth are Wednesday, Thursday and Friday whereas you will see much fewer on a Saturday or Sunday.  Trucks will not go through Kalgoorlie, they cut across from Coolgardie to Norseman.\n\nIf you hitch a car they may ask if you're willing to share the driving, in which case be aware that driving on the left and through thousands of kilometers of empty road in the desert leads easily to that special kind of microsleep where one may crash in a second, so take it easy! \n\nGetting out of Perth, take the train to Midland station, at the end of the line. From here take bus 320 and ask the driver to put you down on Great Eastern Hwy Before Park Rd A. There is a small paved rest stop area before the bus stop, where cars and even trucks can pull over easily, and good visibility of the road for some distance. Here you're out of the city already and should easily get a lift at least a few km along the road to the towns of Sawyer's Valley and Baker's Hill, which are good places to catch a longer ride as the road slows there for the townships.  Further along is Northam, which the main highway bypasses (don't take a lift into the town, but rather stay on the bypass which is the highway).  There is an ok spot to stand at the second turnoff to Northam, but it is just by the highway and people tend to be driving by fast. A lot of the traffic to (Kal)goorlie is worker dudes returning to work after a splash in the big smoke, easy rides, most traffic going long distance will be <12am.\n\nThe bus only goes once an hour from Midland, mostly at the half-hour but you may want to check in advance to avoid a long wait. You'll be getting off in Zone 3, so plan your bus/train ticket accordingly. Midland train station is also a famously bad area of Perth, so take care of your stuff and yourself, and don't be there at night if you can help it. But you'll be fine in the daytime and there are usually police around somewhere. Just be aware also that if you look too scruffy, drivers may hesitiate to pick you up on account of this.\n\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n\n\n{{IsIn|Australia}}\n[[Category:Australia]]\n[[Category:E15]]"},

Traffic will be slow after coming around the bend, so don't stand too far down the ramp.  \n==== Oregon Ave. on-ramp ([http://hitchwiki.org/maps/?place=22318 HW Map]) ====\nThis spot has more trucks, but in the states, they seldom stop on on-ramps.\n\n=== North on [[I-95]] towards [[Trenton, NJ|Trenton]], [[New Jersey|NJ]]; [[New York City|New York]], [[New York State|NY]]; [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts|MA]]; [[Maine]]===\n==== Oregon Ave. on-ramp ([http://hitchwiki.org/maps/?place=22432 HW Map]) ====\nThis spot has lots of truck traffic, but they seldom stop on on-ramps.\n\n=== West on [[I-76]] towards [[Valley Forge, PA|Valley Forge]], [[Ohio]] ===\n==== From Exit 338 ([http://hitchwiki.org/maps/?place=22437 HW Map]) ====\nTake the Manayunk/Norristown regional rail line (or a bus) to Manayunk station.  Follow the tracks northwest to Green Ln.  Turn left and follow it to cross the bridge across the Schuylkill (SKOO-kull) River.   After crossing an onramp to I-76W will be on the right.  \n\n=== East to [[New Jersey]] ===\n==== Walt Whitman Bridge ====\nThe Walt Whitman is the best bridge to Jersey, since it connects directly to [[I-295]] and the A/C expressway.  There's only a toll in the westbound direction, so you'll have to use an on-ramp.  There is a good place to hitch under the bridge at Front St. ([http://hitchwiki.org/maps/?place=26792 HW Map]).  Check the green signs to make sure you're in the right place.  \n\n==== Ben Franklin Bridge ====\nIf you insist on taking the Ben Franklin bridge, take PATCO across the bridge and into the state.  (You can always walk across the bridge, but there are no good places to get a ride from the other side.)  Probably the best technique is to get to a gas station along routes 70 or 38.  Gas is significantly cheaper in New Jersey so people often fuel up after entering the state.  The indians who run the stations are probably friendly, and you won't attract as much police attention by staying off the road (hitchhiking is explicitly illegal in Jersey).  \n\n== Accommodation and sleep ==\nFairmount park is big enough to camp in.\n\n== Public transport ==\nThe Philadelphia-area public transportation network is called SEPTA ([http://www.septa.org website]). It encompasses local buses, subways, trolleys, and trains.  You can get transit directions from their website or [http://maps.google.com Google Maps].  \n\n=== Buses, trolleys, subways ===\nThe buses and trolleys are nearly impossible to blackride on and, for the most part, remain within in the city anyway.\nThe subway is good and cheap if you need to get around the city, but are also difficult to blackride on.\n\n=== Regional Rail ===\nHowever, the trains are fairly easy to blackride on. You can get out of the city in most any direction via SEPTA's regional rail train. Most of these trains don't check tickets until after you're on; if tickets are checked pre-boarding, just wait for the next train. Conductors come around after each stop checking for new fares, so unless you buy a ticket you'll be asked to get off at the next stop if you don't pay up on-board. However, many passengers leave their tickets on-board, so finding one before the conductor comes through is possible.\n\n== Places to visit ==\nPhiladelphia is rich in independence '''history''' if you like that sort of thing.  Check out the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall.  \n\nThere is a great '''music''' scene too.  [http://diyphl.com DIYPHL.com] has good show listings.  \n\nThere's a '''bonfire''' that happens Wednesdays at the Glendinning Rock Garden, just north of Girard and 33rd.

Get here by bus number 16, get off at 'Malpighi 2' and walk across the fields. You can continue walking straight until you hit the field, turn right and left immediately into a track. Follow it through the field to a road where you turn left and follow straight until you hit the highway (don't cross it). here you turn left, go under the bridge and through some gardens until you hit the gas station where you need to hop the fence. There might be an easier and more accessible way to get in, but that's the information that is available so far :-)\n\n=== North  towards [[Genova]], [[France]]  ===\nTake the bus LAM rosso (red line) to the Aurelia bus stop (it's in an opposite direction to the airport so different starting bus stop!). From there go further about 100m until you reach a roundabout and SS1 route. After the roundabout go straight. There is a turn right from the route to the hotel/restaurant where all the cars can easily pull over. Hitchhike there! It took me about 15 min to get a ride to Genova. --[[User:Polski Matematyk|Polski Matematyk]]\n\nUntested: One possibility is the crossing of Viale della Cascine / Via Ponte a Viglieri north-west of the city or a petrol station maybe 1km south of that point.\n\n== Accommodation and Sleep ==\nFrom the tower it is a 10 minute walk out of town where you can try to pitch a tent.

One spot in Gaia is a roundabout, next to the last metro stop (\'\'Santo Ovídio\'\'). This is an okay spot to stand, even at night, for going to both towards the north Porto and above as well as going south (but it is definitely easier to get a ride to the north there). It is better if you stare down the highway which points towards A1 Highway going to Lisbon and turning right to Porto and North, there is a small red light and stand there if you want to head back to Porto and North.\n\n==== From Repsol, Vila Nova de Gaia ====\n\n[[File:Porto_south_repsol_back_entrance.jpeg|200px|thumb|right|The entrance to the fenced tunnel to the back entrance of the gas station]]   There is a petrol station on the A1 highway just after the ramp which is excellent for rides to the south. Get to the last stop of the metro line D called Santo Ovídio. Walk south down Rua de Soares dos Reis (N1) and continue walking when it becomes the Rue Fonte dos Arrependidos. Pass under the highway through the tunnel and keep walking on the Rua Alto das Terras. After a few hundred meters you will see the petrol station on your left. Should take ~15 minutes, mostly downhill and in the shade. Walk the dirt road full of garbage to the left till you find fenced tunnel (pictured) that leads to door to the station with a doorbell you can ring so the staff will come and let you in. They\'re fine with coming to open it.\nAs of May 2019 the doorbell is broken, but if you happen to have a mobile phone with you, you can call them at +351 22 712 6842 and they will open the door for you (it\'s really work!). In case you don\'t have a working sim card, you can probably shout to attract attention and have them come over. Failing that, it\'s also easy to get to the petrol station for someone that is ok with a "short moment of illegality": after the tunnel you can climb to your left side and then walk along the highway for some meters to the petrol station. Otherwise it\'s also possible to climb over the gas station fence. A special tip, after the tunnel keep looking on your left side, you can find a lot of wild strawberries (in Summer, of course).\n\nYou can either stand in the petrol station or at the exit ramp. You can also try to stand in the highway itself, but as a passing policeman said, it is unlikely cars in the highway stop.\n\nThe following service station on the A1 is called Antuã-Estarreja. Anyone who is going in the direction of [[Aveiro]] but not to Lisbon can drop you off here, where there will be plenty off cars almost all bound straight for Lisbon.\n\n=== The route to [[France]] ===\n\nFor people trying to go from Porto and enter France as fast as possible. Go to the second Gas station, get lift in the direction of Viseu and then get dropped at any petrol station and then look out for cars and Portugese trucks which are going to France or cars that are from Belgium or Netherlands. Be patient and ensure you do not get down anywhere else but only \'\'\'petrol stations\'\'\'; don\'t go with drivers to their city center or you will get stuck. Near border of Spain before the border if you are at a gas station, wait until you find a car or truck that goes all the way to Saint Sebastian, a Spanish town on the French border. You will have to be patient and you will definitely find with a little time and patience. Try to get a direct ride to France ( so that you can \'\'\'skip Spain\'\'\') which is a disaster for long distance hitchhiking.\n\nStart from the petrol station near "Vila nova de Gaia".\n\n=== North towards [[Braga]] and [[Spain]] ([[Vigo]], [[Santiago de Compostela]]) ===\n\n==== Option 1 ====\n\nTake the Tram/Train to São Frutuoso\u200e (less than 2 Euro). Walk the \'\'Rua Prof. Antonio Marques\'\' until the end and you\'ll arrive at a petrol station right next to the motorway to Vigo/Spain after appx 800m.\n\'\'Note:\'\' There is a fence around the whole petrol station, almost impossible to climb. To ring the bell and ask for entrance is a bad idea. Walk along the fence until the bridge where it\'s easy to climb over (January 2012). Try to be unwatched climbing the fence, the petrol station is privatized. I got kicked out in January 2012...In February 2012 I got dropped off on the other side direction Lisbon and had no problem at all staying at the petrol station. Just make sure they don\'t see you enter the petrol station "illegally".--[[User:Wukk|Wukk]] 18:14, 28 February 2012 (CET)\n\n==== Option 2 ====\n\nYou may hitch from the petrol station close to metro station "Estadio do mar". At the roundabout, take Av. Calouste Gulbenkian, pass the School of design and you will see an entrance to coastal motorway A28 going North. People might also be going North using other motorways from there since there is a junction heading East close by.\n\nThere are probably many other ways of leaving Porto in that direction, yet to be discovered and shared.\n\nMe and my travel-buddy tried the petrol station close to the metro station "Estadio do mar", but couldn\'t get a ride after trying for one hour. Some people at the petrol station told us about a FREE shuttle bus \'\'\'(free bus shuttle – MAR Lines – ended its operation in July 31st 2017\'\'\' ) going north to IKEA (located close to the motorway A28) where a lot of spanish people go for shopping. The best way to get to the bus-station for the free shuttle-bus is to take the metro to "Senhora da Hora" (one stop before "Estadio do mar"), walk back (if you took the metro from the city) on the street along the metro-line, take a right into the street called "Avenida de António Domingues dos Santos / Rua da Barranha" and find a bus-station on the right side. This is how it looks like:\n\nhttp://maps.google.com/maps?q=senhora+da+hora,+4460+Matosinhos,+Oporto,+Portugal&hl=en&ll=41.186549,-8.654994&spn=0.000793,0.001161&sll=41.253032,-8.602295&sspn=1.497015,2.37854&vpsrc=0&t=h&layer=c&cbll=41.186549,-8.654994&panoid=gGtOnq9c4EOLBmuF6RQZqQ&cbp=12,299.34,,0,6.98&z=20\n\nTake the red bus to "Mar Shopping" and get off there. We were standing at the exit of the parking-lot of IKEA and got a ride to "Viana do Castelo" after 15 minutes. This is how the mall and the bus look like:\n\nhttp://maps.google.com/maps?q=ikea+mar+shopping,+4460+Matosinhos,+Oporto,+Portugal&hl=en&ll=41.208864,-8.689574&spn=0.006094,0.009291&sll=41.209914,-8.657227&sspn=0.093627,0.148659&vpsrc=6&z=17&layer=c&cbll=41.20876,-8.689572&panoid=xx4h3tQhwqqamcgEh1_2aQ&cbp=12,22.54,,0,11.78\n\nThe free shuttle-bus runs every 1,5 hours. The IKEA is open Monday to Saturday 10h-23h and Sunday/Holidays 10h-20h. I assume those times the shuttle bus runs aswell. Should it not run you can walk down "Avenida de António Domingues dos Santos / Rua da Barranha" from the bus-station to the metro station "Estadio do mar" in a few minutes and follow the descriptions above.\n\n=== East towards [[Amarante]], [[Vila Real]], [[Mirandela]] and [[Bragança]] ===\n\nThe [http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/A4_%28autoestrada%29#.C3.81reas_de_servi.C3.A7o_e_de_repouso second petrol station] on the A4 motorway is a good spot to catch a ride East.

Bento" or "Campanhã",  and get off at "Águas Santas/Palmilheira".\n\nhttps://www.google.com/maps/dir/41.200041,-8.5565396/41.2000340,+-8.5645780/@41.1980698,-8.5662228,15z/data=!4m9!4m8!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x0:0x0!2m2!1d-8.564578!2d41.200034!3e2\n\nATTENTION: There are only 3 other petrol stations on this motorway ([http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/A4_%28autoestrada%29#.C3.81reas_de_servi.C3.A7o_e_de_repouso check Wikipedia for update]), one just after [[Penafiel]], the next one near Lamares after Villa Real, and the last just before [[Mirandela]], so if you stay on the petrol station above, ask drivers going to [[Vila Real]] to leave you on Penafiel\'s petrol Station, from there it\'s pretty easy to get a hitch to [[Amarante]] and [[Vila Real]].\n\n=== Sleep ===\nIf you walk from the centre east, just past the second to last white bridge there is an old train line between the upper centre and the lower road that runs along the river. Along this old train line are a few old train tunnels that are easy and relatively clean. Easily accessible from the lower road and from the top by stairways. \n\nIf you continue East a little more, nearing the last white bridge and opposite the beach there are a few empty fields, again between the lower road and the town above. Locals pass through these fields, but it would be easy to spend the night without being bothered. \n\nAnother good option is to pitch a tent or just sleep in the bushes in the biggest park of Porto - Parque de Cidade. It\'s located quite far from the center, but in a very nice area near the ocean. Park is huge and there are a lot of good places with bushes and trees for a tent. In the center of this park there is a large public WC which has free hot showers. It is a large round concrete building with ivy growing all around it, you can\'t miss it! Only open during the day. There is good transport connection with the city center, or just follow Avenida da Boavista, it takes 60-80 minutes on foot from the center..\n\nPorto center streets can be a bit scary at night, if you need to sleep well and safe the airport is your best option. It is warm and safe and you can blackride the metro from the center to there in about 30 minutes and return the next morning to the city.\n\nCamping\nThere is a lot of campings near "Praia de Madalena". It is close to the city centre, you just have to take the bus number 906. A place costs 6 euro per night.\n\n=== Eat ===\nOn the Rua Doutor Alves da Veiga/Rua de Fernandes Tomas every weekday charity organisations feed people, start at 21:00. Ofcourse for free.\n\nFood is very cheap in Portugal, you can have a dinner for 3.5 euro.\n\nDuring Livediverse\'s stay in Porto, he got this recommendations for cheap vegan food:\n\nRes da Rua\n\nCasa da Horta\n\nEspaço Compasso\n\nYou can also eat in some another places which serve organic food like Quintal Bioshop. There is also a place called Suribachi which serves macrobiotic food.\n\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n\n\n\n\n{{IsIn|Portugal}}\n\n[[Category:Portugal]]\n[[Category:E1]]\n\n[[de:Porto]]'},

It is much more recommended to go to the toll plaza, but of course it can take some minutes longer than going to Głogowska street.\n\n=== West towards [[Berlin]] ([[Germany]]) {{Apl|2}} {{E|30}} ===\n====Toll plaza Gołuski====\n{{Coords|52.3504|16.7318}}<br>\nGo to \'\'Ogrody\'\' (last stop of trams 2, 7, 17, 18 and many buses) and take suburban bus no. \'\'\'718\'\'\' ([http://www.ztm.poznan.pl/assets/Uploads/linie/Linia718s.pdf route], [http://ztm.poznan.pl/network/timetables/#/kierunki/PUK/linia/719 timetables]) or \'\'\'719\'\'\' ([http://www.ztm.poznan.pl/assets/Uploads/linie/Linia719s.pdf route], [http://ztm.poznan.pl/network/timetables/#/kierunki/ZUK/linia/719 timetables]). The bus stop in \'\'Ogrody\'\' is on the other side of the street when you get off the tram. Get out in \'\'\'\'\'Dopiewiec\'\'\'\'\'. The ride takes about 40 minutes. \nYou can also take a mini bus of private company [http://www.skorzewo.pl/forum/sprawy-lokalne/bis-trans-rozklad-jazdy Bis Trans] which goes from the same spot in \'\'Ogrody\'\' to \'\'Dopiewo\'\' which is next village after \'\'\'\'\'Dopiewiec\'\'\'\'\'. Ask the driver to stop in \'\'\'\'\'Dopiewiec\'\'\'\'\'.\n\nFrom there walk for about 2km south and then just jump over the fence (before the police station) to get on the parking after the toll. Here\'s the [http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&ll=52.353718,16.717973&spn=0.012739,0.027637&t=h&z=15&msid=112760156584939739161.000469d4924c2bad2c929 route].\n\nAlternatively you can get to the toll plaza with a local train and a walk of 4 km. Take a local train (KM/REG) from Poznań Główny (central station) to [[Zbąszynek]] or [[Zielona Góra]] and get out after 12 or 14 minutes in [[Palędzie]]. From the station walk along the railway on Kolejowa street (going west). At the end of the street turn left on Pocztowa. At the end of this street turn right on Ojca Mariana Zelazka. 250 meter after the last houses you turn left on an unpaved fieldroad with willow trees. This fieldroad brings you to the toll plaza. \n\n THIS METHOD DOESN\'T WORK ANYMORE!.THERE IS A HIGH FENCE BETWEEN THE ROAD AND THE FIELD , AND THERE IS A POLICE STATION NEAR THE TOLL PLAZA. DON\'T TRY IT ANYMORE!.\n\n====MOP Dopiewiec\'\' Rest Services====\n{{Coords|52.3502|16.7142}}<br>\nStart like above - from \'\'Ogrody\'\' catch the (infrequent, ticket inspected) bus 729 for about an hour to Dopiewiec. Walk back East along the road for 100m or so, then South along a road (turn right (along Szkolna?) for less than a km. You\'ll come to the A2 motorway - before the crossing and just over a meter high fence to the West (on your right) you\'ll find a rest station. There are only toilets and so little traffic, but I got a ride by asking in under 10 minutes. Did this in July 2018 on the advice if a local.\n\n====Bus stop on \'\'Głogowska\'\' street====\n{{Coords|52.3764|16.8722}}<br>\nGet to \'\'Górczyn\'\' (last stop of trams 5, 8, 14 and many buses). From there walk over the rail tracks by bridge and go straight for about 800m. Behind the second traffic lights there\'s a bus stop where you can hitch. There\'s no point of going further as expressway starts just a few hundred meters behind the bus stop. This expressway is a main road linking city center with motorway A2 from the west. There are also two petrol stations nearby where you can ask drivers. From the same spot you can hitch towards Wrocław so make a sign.\nA lot of local people will go to Komorniki, the first suburb of Poznań in that direction, where there are a lot of shops like Auchan (supermarket) and a McD. Often you will hear the recommendation that from there you will easily find a lift to the A2, but actually this is not true. Most traffic is coming from the A2 and is going to the center of Poznan. \n\nIf you happen to be stranded on that McD, you can also walk towards \'\'Głogowska\'\' road, just under the bridge, there\'s a lane in direction of [[Świecko]], that some locals take. You can either take this and go to [[Berlin]] directly or hitchhike until the toll plaza, which will be a much easier option. \n\nIf you plan to go to Germany, it is also a good possibility to catch a ride to Warszawa, get out at the toll box and change the side. Once on the motorway it will be very very easy to catch a ride to Germany because there is no big city inbetween Poznan and the border and if a car here stops for you, you can be quite sure it crosses the border.\n\n====Marii Lange Roundabout====\nINFO AS OF WINTER 2022: Get to \'\'Górczyn PKM\'\' (last stop of tram lines 3, 5, 14 and many buses). From there take bus no 704 or 710 to the stop \'\'Konopackiej\'\' or 703, 705, 180 to \'\'Sycowska Centrum Handlowe\'\' (the bus stop is just by the mall). Walk towards the McDonald\'s sign, it\'s visible from both of the stops. You will get to a roundabout where people get on and off the highway. There\'s a grass patch by the entry road to the McDonald\'s, you can stand there with a sign, your back turned to the McDonald\'s. People will stop on the parking lot or in the middle of the road that\'s behind you so make sure to check once in a while. It\'s relatively easy to catch something here, usually doesn\'t take more than an hour. From the same spot you can also hitchhike east towards [[Łódź]] and [[Warszawa]] and south towards [[Wrocław]] and [[Kraków]] so make sure to bring a sign!\n\nGo to \'\'Ogrody\'\' (last stop of trams 2, 7, 17, 18 and many buses) and take bus no. 61 direction \'\'Krzyżowniki\'\'. Get out at the ninth stop called \'\'\'\'\'Ul. Wichrowa\'\'\'\'\' and walk along the road for about 300 m then you will see petrol station and McD\'s. Ask drivers there or stay on the road with sign or thumb. Also about 100 m after this place is a bus stop so it\'s more convenient for drivers to stop their car.\n\n \'\'Comment by a local: It\'s more convenient to get off at a stop named \'\'\'\'\'Smochowice\'\'\'\'\'. You can hitch hike from there or (what i usually do) hitch until the bus 01 (going through \'\'\'\'\'Sady\'\'\'\'\', don\'t mess it up!) arrives.  Get  on the bus, buy a ticket to Tarnowo and get off after you pass Sady. It\'s probably the 2nd stop after Sady, as far as i know the name is \'\'Marianowo\'\' (i\'m not 100% sure about it though). You will notice it since it\'s a perfect  place to hitch-hike: there are 2 lanes instead of 3, you are visible from a far distance and there is a lot of space for a car to stop. On your left side there will be a forest, on the right side there are few houses, in front of you there will be a board which indicates, that it\'s the road towards the Pl - D boarder.\n\'\'\n\n \'\'Comment by J.N.: Just ride bus 01 to Tarnowo Podgorne instead of confusing yourself over which bus goes through Sady. Ride/walk along the main road through Tarnowo Podgorne until the end of the village where there is a roundabout on which the local road joins road 92 going to Pniewy and Swiebodzin. You can hitchhike on the roundabout. The businessman who picked me up told me he and his colleagues prefer using this road over the highway as there are much less traffic jams due to roadworks and trucks" (10.8.2011)\'\'.\n\n=== East towards [[Łódź]], [[Warsaw|Warszawa]] {{Apl|2}} {{E|30}} ===\n====Roundabout Rataje====\nGet to \'\'Rondo Rataje\'\' (roundabout). There are plenty of trams and buses going there. You can hitch just behind it, on a dual carriegeway (the one without tram tracks). There\'s no emergency lane or bus stop, but drivers generally stop there, and you may even expect some competition there, as it\'s popular spot for students hitching back from school. From the same spot you can hitch southeast towards [[Katowice]], so make a sign.\n\n This spot is not good, I got stuck here for several hours with another hitchhiker until I gave up and took the bus. The stop appears like it should be a very good one but no one will stop. Not recommended. (08/2016).\n\n====Junction Poznań Luboń====\nIn the city centre, just in front of the castle there\'s a bus stop called \'\'Zamek\'\'. From there take a bus 71 in the direction \'\'Osiedle Dębina\'\' and get off at the end. Go along the main road till you get to the motorway junction. You can ask at the red lights for a lift to the nearest petrol station on A2 (MOP Krzyżowniki), which is just before the junction Poznań Wschód (exit for S5 towards Gniezno). Ask: \'\'stacja benzynowa A2\'\' (pronounce statsya benzenova ah dva).\n\n====Toll plaza Gołuski====\nSee direction Berlin, then just go to the other side of the motorway.\n\n====Marii Lange Roundabout====\nINFO AS OF WINTER 2022: Get to \'\'Górczyn PKM\'\' (last stop of tram lines 3, 5, 14 and many buses). From there take bus no 704 or 710 to the stop \'\'Konopackiej\'\' or 703, 705, 180 to \'\'Sycowska Centrum Handlowe\'\' (the bus stop is just by the mall).

It\'s relatively easy to catch something here, usually doesn\'t take more than an hour. From the same spot you can also hitchhike west towards [[Berlin]] and south towards [[Wrocław]] and [[Kraków]] so make sure to bring a sign!\n\n====Petrol station on Warszawska street====\nFrom city center take trams 6 or 8 to \'\'Miłostowo\'\' and get out at the last stop. From there walk along the road about 100 m and you will see Orlen petrol station. You can either ask drivers at the station or hitch at the end of it where is a place for cars to pull over. \n\n This spot at the road is ok, but traffic is going a bit fast (70km/u). [[User:Worldhitchhiker|Worldhitchhiker]] stood there for more than an hour. After that he moved to the petrol station and asked people, then I got a lift within 15 minutes to a gas station at the highway (04/2019).\n\nOptionally you can walk along the same road and after 200-300m you will see a bridge and Volkswagen factory. Hitch straight after the bridge on the bus stop (there is plenty of cars and trucks who are going by inner bypass around Poznan, so many of them are going for a longer distances, and you may avoid local traffic like it\'s possible at the first place mentioned).\n\n=== Northeast towards [[Bydgoszcz]], [[Toruń]], [[Gdańsk]] {{National Road Number Poland|5}} {{E|261}} ===\nTake bus no. 73 direction \'\'Janikowo/Ogrodnicza\'\' from place called \'\'Rondo Sródka\'\' and get out after 11 stops (about 15-18 minutes) at bus stop called \'\'\'\'\'Bogucin Bałtycka\'\'\'\'\'. Hitch on this bus stop, it\'s on the road to Gniezno, Bydgoszcz and Gdańsk just after junction with Poznań bypass. You should notice railways nearby and crossed Poznań sign (end of the city zone). Notice that if your driver goes to [[Gnizeno]], make sure you exit before the city, since the road becomes a motorway inside the city and there is no good spot to be found.\nUPDATE: If going north, e.g. to Gdańsk and your driver continues straight ahead to Gnizeno, ask to be let out just before the big new highway crossing to the west of Gnizeno. There is a bus stop where even trucks can stop, whereas the crossing itself is not very busy and the cars go much to fast. Morsch, August 2018.\n\n=== North towards [[Piła]], [[Koszalin]] {{National Road Number Poland|11}} ===\nFrom city centre e.g. \'\'Rondo Kaponiera\'\' take tram 9, 11 to \'\'Piątkowska\'\' and get out at the last stop. From there go north along \'\'Piątkowska\'\' street to the first junction, then turn west (left) and go to roundabout \'\'Rondo Obornicka\'\'. On roundabout turn north again (right) and enter national road no. 11 (you will see hipermarket Carrefour next to you). You can hitch after roundabout or anywhere along \'\'Obornicka\'\' street where is a place to pull over. There\'s almost always traffic jam, so cars go slowly, which helps hitchhikers.\n\n=== Northwest towards [[Gorzów Wielkopolski]], [[Szczecin]] {{National Road Number Poland|92}} ===\nSee direction Berlin by national road 92 as it\'s the same spot.\n\n=== South and southwest towards [[Wrocław]] {{National Road Number Poland|5}} {{E|261}} and [[Zielona Góra]] {{National Road Number Poland|32}} ===\n====From bus stop on Głogowska street====\nSee direction Berlin by motorway A2, from \'\'Głogowska\'\' street as it\'s the same spot.\n\n====From the village of Szreniawa==== \nGet to \'\'Górczyn\'\' (last stop of trams 5, 8, 14 and many buses). Then take a bus 703 to the station AFTER \'\'\'\'\'Szreniawa\'\'\'\'\' (aproximatelly 25 min by bus from Górczyn). After getting off you can easily catch a car in the direction of Leszno, Wrocław. Get off the bus, walk back a few meters, turn right and walk down the path for about 200m to a bus stop where you can hitch.\n\n====Marii Lange Roundabout====\nSee direction Berlin or Warszawa/Łódź by motorway A2, same spot.\n\n=== Southeast towards [[Ostrów Wielkopolski]], [[Katowice]] {{National Road Number Poland|11}} ===\nSee direction Warszawa by motorway A2, from behind roundabout \'\'Rataje\'\', as it\'s the same spot.\n\n== Public Transport ==\n\nThe city has efficient public transport system with daytime trams and buses operating from 5.00 till 23.00 and nighttime buses and one tram running every half an hour. In Poznań you can not buy tickets at the driver, you can get them in newsagents (kiosk) and grocery shops, and there is more and more ticket machines on the stops. The most convenient way is to buy the tickets directly in the [https://jakdojade.pl/poznan jakdojade.pl] app. Some buses and most of the trams have ticket machines inside the vehicle and you can buy tickets there, but prepare coins. A 15 minutes ticket costs 4 PLN (December 2022). If you travel a lot by public transport, the most cost-effective option is a 24-hour ticket, which offers unlimited rides for 24 hours and costs 15-20 PLN. There is a 50% student discount (\'\'ulgowy\'\' ticket) upon showing a valid student ID. You have to scan paper tickets when entering the bus/tram, the scanners are yellow and usually located near the doors.  Drivers don\'t care if you have a ticket and all the doors are open on stops, but there are controllers checking tickets from time to time. They\'re dressed in civilian clothing and usually don\'t care about any explaination you might have. For riding without a valid ticket you will be fined from 140 to 280 PLN. \n\nTip: if you buy a 24-hr ticket on a Friday after 8PM, it will be valid all weekend until Sunday midnight.\n\nThere is a good [http://jakdojade.pl/Welcome.jsp?locale=en website] showing you how to get from one point to another by public transport in major Polish cities.\n\n== Eating ==\n===Traditional===\nIn Poland you can find many places called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_bar milk bars] or dairy bars (bar mleczny) where traditional Polish and Eastern European cuisine are sold. They are subsidized by the state and city authorities, so the prices are very low.\nNames and locations:\n* Caritas - Plac Wolności \n* Pod Arkadami - Plac Cyryla Ratajskiego 10\n* Przysmak - Ul. Podgórna 2 \nNormally they are open till 18.00 or 19.00. \'Apetyt\' is open until 22:00.\n\n===Other===\n* Chain of diners \'\'Piccolo\'\'. Cheap pasta/faux-italian dishes. 9PLN for a small serving.

Cheap pasta and rice dishes, they have vegetarian options. 8PLN for a small serving. (rynek Łazarski 11, Kraszewskiego 9b, Słowiańska 53B, Plac Ratajskiego 6, Marcelińska 94)\n* There\'s a lot of sketchy looking Kebab restaurants all around the city. Not the best quality but it\'s a good option if you need a hearty meal for a reasonable price. One of the most popular and cheapest is the \'\'Zahir kebab\'\' chain. Most of the places are open til late night and carry vegetarian options (falafel). As for winter 2022, you generally shouldn\'t be paying more than 16PLN for a small kebab. \n* If you\'re truly desperate for a hot meal, a chain of corner stores named Żabka operate in Poland. They are open 6:00-23:00 and located basically everywhere. You can buy a hot-dog for 5PLN or a reheated panini for 10PLN. \n===Free Food===\n* Every Saturday at 17:30 there\'s a soup kitchen for those in need at the tram stop Dworzec Zachodni PST. It\'s called Zupa Na Głównym. \n* Poznań has a branch of Food Not Bombs, an anarchist organization distributing food. They give out free meals for everyone on Sundays at 16:00, by the Stary Marych monument on Półwiejska street. \n\n===Bars and Nightlife===\n* Really cheap shot bar called \'\'Czupito\'\' on one of the corners of the Old Market Square. Warning, it\'s pretty packed on weekends.\n* Cheapest beer in the city, bar \'\'Pomidor\'\' (pol. "tomato"), Długa 7. \n* Neighboring clubs \'\'Mustang\'\' and \'\'Pod Minogą\'\'.

From this roundabout, there is an exit going on the motorway in the good direction, with a nice place for cars to stop. Use a sign with Laval written on it, if your driver don\'t want to pay for the toll you can ask him to drop you at the last exit before it from there you can simply walk to the toll station.\n\n[[dws49]] waited 20 minutes and got a ride all the way to Paris !\n\nAnother option is to go to \'\'Noyal sur Vilaine\'\', there a transport company operate you can just ask truck driver at the gate or hitch on the entrance of the motorway next to it.\n\nAt the end of summer vacancy, it\'s also possible to find people going back toward [[Paris]], all the tourist coming from the south of Britanny taking the N24 pass by Rennes see the West towards [[Vannes]], [[Lorient]], [[Quimper]] section how to get there but of course hitchhike on the other direction at the entrance of the ring road.\n\n=== North East towards [[Fougéres]], [[Caen]], [[Rouen]] ===\nTake the bus line 1 in the direction of Champs Blancs. Get off at the terminus, make your way north to the roundabout Boulevard Allies/Route Fougeres, place yourself on the Boulevard des Allies direction of the periferic (signs may also indicate Route de Saint Sulpice).\nAt the exit of the roundabout cars pass quiet quickly, but there is a long strip for cars to pull over about 2 meters after.\n\n== Hitching in ==\n=== From south ===\n\nIf you are coming from south by the N137, and that your driver does not stop at Rennes, he will probably want to take the ring. It is not good for you !\n\nIn this case the best option for you is to ask him to get into Rennes for a few hundreds meters at the end of the N137. Next to the first roundabout, ask him to follow the signs "Centre Commercial", there is a parking where you can stop safely. The metro station \'\'Henri Fréville\'\' is very close. Then your driver has just to go back to the roundabout, where he can go back on the ring. Otherwise, you will not be able to cross the ring by feet to get into Rennes.\n\n\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\n\n[[nomad:Rennes]] [[trash:Rennes]]\n\n{{Cities France}}\n\n{{IsIn|Bretagne}}\n\n[[Category:France]]\n[[Category:Bretagne]]\n[[Category:E50]]\n\n[[de:Rennes]]\n[[fr:Rennes]]'},

Its is right at the entrance of some kind of motorway (wich is not yet the highhay, the pay toll ("pedaggio") entering on highway A1 is still about 6 km away). You can walk along this two-lanes motorway and find a petrol station a few hundreds meters further up. There, ask for a ride to the highway. People could also be heading to [[Rieti]] (\'\'check this name\'\'), ask them if they can let you at the pay toll ("casello"), where there is a petrol station right before.\n\n==== Option 2 ====\n\n\'\'\'A)\'\'\' \'\'This\'\' {{Coords|42.0045509|12.5272698|1}} is a petrol station on the motorway A1 towards Firenze. To get there, take the metro (costs 1.5 euro) to "Tiburtina", and from there a regional train to "Settebagni". It takes 20 minutes, leaves every 15 minutes on weekdays and costs 1 Euro. You can follow [https://goo.gl/maps/RSDE7BRwM4x this route] to the footbridge over the motorway which leads you to the petrol station - the road is called Via dell\'Inviolatella Salaria. You shouldn\'t walk more than about 20-25 minutes from the station. Until Firenze, there are around 5 more petrol stations to change cars, so it goes quite well. The last one is 5 km before Firenze. \n\n\'\'\'B)\'\'\' [http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.010805,12.51824&num=1&t=h&sll=42.00736,12.52286&sspn=0.016583,0.032015&ie=UTF8&ll=42.009525,12.521281&spn=0.009008,0.01929&z=16 This] is petrol station which should at least bring you on the highway A1. (But probably it\'s worth looking for a totally other petrol station on A1 which is reachable by public transport; at the latter station a lot of people don\'t head onto the motorway, a lot head home)\n\n\'\'\'Option 3\'\'\' to Grosseto\n\nTake bus to Maglianella/Riserva Di Torretta, and walk a little bit forward to the highway and turn left, walk 20meters, there is a bus stop\xa0 «\xa0Aurelia/Brava\xa0», a big place for car to stop.\n\n\n=== South towards [[Napoli]], [[Sicily]] ===\n\n\'\'\'Option 1\'\'\'\n\nThis is the first gas station on the highway connecting Rome to the A1 highway going south. It\'s still inside the city, so very easy to reach, but it\'s already on the highway. There is a fence on the back but if you look trough some bushes where a little building is, the fence is broken and easy to climb, or there is an hole in the bottom (to be updated if they fix it). Go to Anagnina station either by metro or by bus (it\'s one of the biggest terminal in Rome)  take the bus 046 and stop at "carnevale lettere", the gas station is only 400 m away. Walk back for a few meters  cross the road and turn right on via cavaglieri, and then the first left, and at the end of the street there is the gas station. there are also other buses going around the area (500, 504...) just use the route planner of public transport to see what\'s the best for you\nhttp://www.atac.roma.it/index.asp?lingua=ENG\n\n\'\'\'Option 2\'\'\'\n\nTake Line No. 105 (Staz. ne Grotte Celoni) to the stop \'\'\'Casilina/Tor Vergata\'\' (29 stops), walk 150 meters, go to stop \'\'Tor Vergata/Casilina\'\', take Line No. 507 (Anagnina (Ma)) to \'\'Heidelberg\'\' (4 stops) take Line No. 509 (Fosso del Cavaliere/CNR) to \'\'Fosso del Cavaliere/CNR\'\' (2 stops).  Follow the sign Napoli to your right and then at keep left at the tournabout. Bus stops are a good indication that you\'re on the right path. \'\'Via del Fosso del Cavaliere\'\' takes you to the other side of the motorway, and from there keep walking towards the IP Frascati Ovest gas station; you can enter it from the backside. Don\'t bother about "forbidden entrance". And now you can continue hitchhiking towards Napoli/Sicily.\n\n\n=== East towards [[Pescara]], [[L\'Aquila]] ===\n\n\'\'\'Option 1\'\'\'\n\nFrom Termini go by metro line B to Ponte Mammolo station, and there you can take bus 508 (that is first station) and go untill last station Mondavio. That is one long ride and you will come close to crossroad of second ring of highway around Rome and highway from Rome to east [Pescara, L Aquila]. Actually from that last station Mondavio, you have walking around 500m to highway and then choose left side walk to Roma Est Strada dei Parchi toll around 1 km or right side walk to Eni A24 Colle Tasso Sud gas station 1 km. We were walking on the highway which is illegal, but we had a luck not to be caught by police. \n\n\'\'\'Option 2\'\'\'\n\nThere\'s a much more practical option if you want to head east. It\'s a Q8 Easy  gas station at the very beginning of A24 on the outbound side. GPS coordinates are: \'\'41.900767, 12.549775\'\' {{Coords|41.900767|12.549775|1}} While the gas station described above has got traffic heading other directions already filtered out, this one serves people going multiple directions, but is way closer to the city center, easier to reach and still very effective. From Roma Termini, ride subway line B towards Rebibbia, and get off at Monti Tiburtini. From there, walk down the main road until you\'re just past the second overpass (exact coordinates here: 41.902511, 12.556836). From there, walk up the off-ramp trying to keep behind the guardrail. At some point you\'ll have to walk on the very road because of a fence surrounding a canal, but you can climb back over the guardrail after that. At the end of the off-ramp, you\'ll have to walk on the motorway again, but it\'s just a very short distance, and a part of it is ever sheltered by a concrete divider. The gas station is just a few meters down the road. Place also is 5oo metres away from Roma Prenestina train stop\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n\n\n\n__NOTOC__\n\n{{IsIn|Italy}}\n\n\n[[Category:Italy]]\n[[Category:E35]]\n[[Category:E80]]\n\n[[fr:Rome]]'},

If you get out of metro, follow the road S113 and pass by the park with a little lake, go under the bridge and you should already see the spot. It did not look busy but hitchhiking with a sign can be probably also possible because cars are still relatively slow and there is a lot of shoulder.\n\n=== East towards [[Utrecht]], [[Arnhem]], [[Apeldoorn]], [[Amersfoort]], [[Germany]] (A20) {{European Route Number|25}} ===\n====Option 1==== \n{{Coords|51.9342|4.4650}}<br>\nThere is a great spot directly north of the central Station. It is about a 25 minute walk or take tram #25 in the direction of \'\'Schiebroek\'\' until the stop \'\'Schieweg\'\', which is just before the tram goes up onto a bridge over the motorway. Continue walking in the same direction on the right-hand side. During peak hours the traffic is very heavy and is slowed down by traffic lights feeding the traffic onto the motorway at intervals. There is a small parking area, so drivers have ample room to stop.\n\n====Option 2==== \nOn the A16. Take the Metro to \'\'Kralingse Zoom\'\' and walk south down the \'\'Kralingse Zoom\'\' and then left at the \'\'Abram van Rijckevorselweg\'\' until you get to a huge roundabout with an on-road. There\'s a lot of space for cars to stop and a lot of traffic, but getting on the other side of the roundabout can be a tad dangerous and it\'s probably technically speaking illegal to stand there. A sign is a must. \n\n====Option 3====\n\'Knooppunt Kleinpolderplein\' at the A20. Walk a little bit with the bicycle path 50 mtr and you can hitchhike just before the sign that shows you are entering the highway. It is a 10 minutes walk from \' Diergaarde Blijdorp\' , the zoo. A sign is a must and probably also technically speaking illegal. I had to wait 30 min. for a car with the sign \'Utrecht\' but a sign with \'Eerste Benzinestation\' will do even better probably.\n\n====Option 4====\n{{Coords|51.9669|4.5901}}<br>\nBest spots are often at a BP \'\' de Vink\'\' petrol station on the highway, one could also choose to take the train (direction Utrecht, Leewarder, Groningen, Zwolle, Uitgeest or Gouda Goverwelle) or metro (A or B direction Nesselande or Binnenhof) to Rotterdam Alexander. Here you can take bus 190 to Gouda and get off at Luxemburgsezoom. From here you walk a few meter back to the roundabout and you go right to the bridge over the highway. You do not want to go over the bridge but pass it on the left side. You can walk until the highway and go left to the petrol station. This spot can also be reached from metrostation \'De Tochten\', however, a longer walk is necessary.\n\n=== West towards [[Hoek van Holland]] and ferries to [[England]] ===\nThe ferries from the Hook of Holland to England do not often carry trucks and therefore do not always offer free options. To get to the ferry terminal you can blackride the train to Hoek Van Hollland Haven. You can also hitch there from one of the many service stations on the A20 with someone going on the ferry. After speaking to drivers on the A20, most trucks passing through there terminate at the port, which means no free ferry. That being said, you could hitch to where they terminate and continue to [[Calais]].\n\nAt the Hook Of Holland you can ride a ferry to [[Harwich]], England. It is hard if not impossible to get across without paying. On the ferry you can ask around to find someone driving to your destination, even walking around with a hitch sign, and possibly start a conversation\n\n=== South towards [[Dordrecht]], [[Breda]], [[Antwerp]], [[Lille]] (A16) {{European Route Number|19}} ===\n====Option 1==== \nTake tram line 21 (direction De Esch) to the \'\'Woudestein\'\' stop. Once in \'\'Woudestein\'\' you need to follow the big road in front of you. Keep walking in the direction of the \'\'Erasmus university\'\'. If looking for rides at traffic lights is your thing, then there\'s plenty of opportunity on the way. But if not, keep on going until you reach the motorway which crosses in front of you. It\'s about a 15 minute walk. The only place to stand now is next to the last traffic light.  Traffic density is quite high but unfortunately so is the speed of the traffic. It\'s best to have a sign here because although traffic can only be going north or south, there are plentiful exits on the way.\n\n====Option 2==== \n{{Coords|51.9156|4.5157}}<br>\nShell petrol station south of the city that feeds on to the A16. It is directly to the west of `\'\'Oude Plantage, De Esch, Rotterdam, The Netherlands\'\'` and is walking distance from Gerdesiaweg Rotterdam train station and from trams. It has good visibility for you and your potential rides and a slip road entering the station where your ride can stop. From the station, head South until you hit the river, then head west (left) and you will see the station on the side of the river.\n\n=== South towards [[Berg-op-Zoom]], [[Middelbourg]], [[Antwerpen]], [[Gent]] (A29, A4, A58) ===\n{{Coords|51.8443|4.5138}}<br>\nTake tram line 25 to the terminus "Barendrecht Opstelstoor Carnisselande".

It has direct motorway connections to [[Vienna]], [[Munich]] and [[Slovenia]] ([[Villach]]). Most of the traffic between southern [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], especially Germans going for holidays, to the [[Croatia]]n coast passes Salzburg.\n\n== Hitchhiking out ==\nThese tips describe hitchhiking from the city centre. For hitchhiking from the airport, see [[Salzburg airport]].\n\n=== West towards [[Munich]], East towards [[Linz]], [[Vienna]], South towards [[Graz]] ===\n__TOC__\n==== Option 1 ====\nWhen you want to go over the [[A1 (Austria)|A1]], no matter which direction, you should go to the ramp ''Salzburg Mitte'' at the ''Münchener Bundesstrasse'' (B155). There is a lot of traffic and enough place to be seen and for cars to stop. From the town center it's 20–30 minutes walking, but you can also take the bus #4 to ''Schmiedingerstraße''.\n\nGoing in the direction of Munich, there's plenty of space directly on the ramp to the highway, just before the beginning of the tunnel.\n\n[[File:2005 HH in Austria.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[User:Sigurdas|Sigurdas]] and a friend taking it easy while hitch-hiking to Salzburg, 2005]]\n\n[[File:Tunnel Salzburg.jpg|thumb|The hitchhiking spot for Munich at Salzburg]]\n\n==== Option 2 ====\nAnother good spot is a bus-stop ''MAP'' {{Coords|47.8256565|13.0532254|1}} near the end of Bahnhofstrasse, where the Landstrasse crosses the Salzburger-Bundesstrasse, just before the small railroad tunnel. Walk north from the main railroad-station in the city center (10-15 minutes), then follow the Bahnhofstrasse until you arrive at the Landstrasse. This spot is especially good for direction East.\n\n==== Option 3 ====\nWhen traveling to [[Graz]], the best option might be to follow the A1 towards [[Linz]]. Swap to the A9 at the petrol-station left at the crossing 'Voralpenkreuz'. Your driver can continue its normal route from there towards any direction. The A9 towards Graz is a nice tour with many tunnels.\n\n=== South towards [[Ljubljana]] ([[E55]]) ===\nTake bus #3 to the terminus then walk south along ''Alpenstraße'' to the junction with the A10. To avoid walking back, you can also get off two stops before the terminus. \n\nThe ramp onto the A10 worked really well, a car going to Villach stopped within a few minutes. I would reccomend to take the bus 170 from the centre however as it gets you much closer to the ramp, from where the 3 leaves you on Alpenstrasse it's a long walk.\n\nThere is also a field here that is suitable for stealth camping. Walk about 100m further from the bus stop on the ''Alpenstraße'', until you come to the ''Fürstenweg'' on the right side. Enter this street and immediately to your right is a really big field where it's possible to set up a tent.\n\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\n\n[[nomad:Salzburg]] [[trash:Salzburg]]\n\n{{hitchbase_city|217}}\n{{IsIn|Austria}}\n[[Category:Austria]]\n[[Category:E60]]\n[[Category:E55]]\n[[Category:E52]]\n[[Category:Border crossings]]\n\n[[de:Salzburg]]\n[[tr:Salzburg]]"},

Ask to confirm, but I believe that the #104 goes all the way to Peaje Guapilo, which is right on the road out of town, and an excellent spot. The road seperates about 10km beyond Pailon. \n\nOtherwise, since it is fairly cheap, a truffi from the Ex-Terminal in the centre will cost 10B, and go direct to Pailon. Get out as it enters the town, 1 hour, and a good idea.\n\n=== North towards [[Montero]], West towards [[Cochabamba]], [[Oruro]], [[La Paz]] ===\nOn the first ring road (Primero Anillo) take the green bus (micro verde) going to ViruViru International Airport. Get off when it exits to the the airport. Stay on the main road (F4) leading towards Montero and start hitching right after the bridge in front of you {{Coords|-17.6574|-63.1577}}. The first toll booth (peaje) is another 4km down the road.\nAlternatively you can also get off 4km earlier at the last gas station (ES Bioceánico, {{Coords|-17.6918|-63.1589}}) on the way out of town that seemed quite frequented by cars and a few trucks when we passed it in the bus.\nUnlike the local busses (2BS/0,25€), this bus will cost you a little more (6BS/0,75€), but will also bring you well out of central Santa Cruz. \n\n=== Southwest towards [[Sucre]], [[Potosí]], west towards [[Samaipata]], south toward Villamontes, [[Paraguay]], and [[Argentina]] ===\nTo get out of central Santa Cruz and to Ruta 7, take any minibus (micro) going to El Torno. Once out of the ring road around the historic centre most routes run along Avenida Grigotá, which is Ruta 7 exiting the city in that direction. If coming from another area of the city, take a micro along the closest of the concentric ring roads and make a transfer there.  Get off at the toll booth (peaje) right after La Guardia (2,50BS/0,30€) and start hitching.\n\nIf headed south toward Villamontes, Paraguay, and Argentina, you can take the same micro as above but need to get off at the T-junction with Ruta 9, known as Kilómetro 13 (for self-evident reasons). You could hitch there, but most of the traffic passing you goes no farther than the kilometre of exurban neighbourhood that remains down where you\'re headed. An even more compelling reason is that not quite two kilometres from the junction is a gas station. If there\'s no gas and you don\'t want to wait with a truck you find (or can\'t find one) there\'s at least one middling speed bump a ways before the gas station that will help you out. Around 25 kilometres down the highway there\'s a tollbooth, to where [[User:Movethathoof|Movethathoof]] got a ride under those circumstances, with no gas for pumping or desire to wait, flagging a pickup off the road there at the speed bump.\n\n== Public Transportation ==\n\nSanta Cruz is laced by a dense network of minibus routes, the vehicles plying them known as \'micros\'. They make it very easy to get into or out of the city, since several routes run on almost every spoke and ring road into or around the centre, meaning you need not pass through the centre to skirt the city or to get to the outskirts. The [https://cruzero.net/home| Cruzero website and app] offers an impressive level of detail on routes, stops, frequencies, as well as a trip planning function (though don\'t necessarily place too much faith in the exact accuracy of all of its information).\n\n== Places to avoid ==\nViolence is contained in specific barrios, but we aware at night. Central areas are super safe and well policed.\n\n== Accommodation and Sleep ==\nCouchsurfing proved a little difficult here, and you can not sleep in the central squares, for that matter, even put your feet up on the benches. The Terminal is safe enough, but closed up at night. Lots of people sleep around there, and there are guards.\n\n\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n[[Category:City\'s]]\n[[Category:Bolivia]]'},

It goes twice an hour at peak times, so check the public transportation website [http://www.nahverkehr-schwerin.de/] for a timetable (''Fahrplan'' => ''Fahrplanbuchseiten''). The ticket for tram is valid on buses too. You'll be heading out of the inner zone, so you'll need a ticket for the Gesamtnetz. Get out at ''Raben Steinfeld'', and walk up the hill. After 10 min. max you'll find a highway ramp on the right hand side. The first goes south, and if you continue, the second is on your left and heads north. \n\n===Option 2===\nAnother frequented driving route is on the ''Ludwigsluster Chaussee'' heading towards [[Ludwigslust]], because the road passes the {{Ade|24}} 20km from Schwerin. I've never tried it, but it should be possible to take tram line 3 or 4 to ''Ludwigsluster Chaussee'' or ''Haselholz'', and continuing south on the Ludwigsluster Chausee, until it crosses the next big street.

Turn left where the street ends and go straight, under the highway (make sure you have a flashlight to indicate to cars that you are there), and turn right on the first bridge, going back under the same highway. walk up to the Namyangju Tollgate at [37.597N, 127.2414E] (by either climbing the hill immediately or following the road east.\n\nAlternatively, go to Moran Station either on line 8 or the Bundang line, get out at exit 9. Turn 180° and turn right on the main road (following the bridge) until you see the highway on another bridge in front of you. Just before the bridge, there is a small road to your right.

Follow Maeheon St (매헌로) across a park, dive beneath the highway you\'re after, and continue until you see a very wide avenue (there\'s a very visible E-mart mall nearby, might be good for stocking up on supplies before a long journey). You have to cross this wide avenue, there is a pedestrian crossing if you go up a bit on the right. After crossing the road turn left (cross another pedestrian crossing) and then right, following a road that takes you to the expressway in the direction of Busan. You\'ll pass close to an helipad and the rest area should already be visible by that time just after it. GPS Coordinates of the rest area is [37.4601N, 127.0419E]. There\'s also a place to pitch a tent (for those who came late in the evening, plan to set out next morning, and don\'t mind the traffic noise). The rest area itself has toilets for the disabled (with running warm water!), free hot water, free wifi, and all sorts of amenities. This paragraph has been updated the 21/11/2017) See the hitchhiking spot \'\'on map\'\' {{Coords|37.46026|127.04214|1}}.\nI got almost immediate rides out of there on two separate occasions.\n\nexperience summer 2018 (updated November 2018): my friend and myself went there. The staff helped us write a sign in hangeul and we got a ride in 10 minutes. There were many cars offering us rides as the traffic is high and half of the people passing offered to take us. Note: \'\'\'the spot is so good that I suggest you refuse rides not going far enough\'\'\', many people go through this station and you can probably find a ride going directly to the city of your choice on this way. We went into a car that didn\'t go far enough and ended up on a tollgate less conveniently located to catch good rides. Regretted not being more selective.\nSee the hitchhiking spot \'\'on map\'\' {{Coords|37.46026|127.04214|1}}.\n\nOld / economy (saves you 900 won) tip:\nYou will be charged 900 won for riding the Sinbundang Line. That can be avoided at the cost of about half an hour\'s walk. Take the subway/metro line number 3 to Yangjae (342) station (take care to avoid the dark red line, or the whole thing loses its economic sense!) and leave on exit number 7. When you come out, there is a big road south so keep walking on it for ~30min till you reach the big crossroad with the Korean highway Nr.1 and the Yangjae IC (intersection) on your right. The spot on the ramp itself is not very good, but a few hundred meters south along the highway there is a big GS25 service station, with a lot of cars, information center and free internet access :) So stand here, make your sign (in Hangeul) and GOOD LUCK :) \n:after waiting here for about 20 minutes, I stopped a BMW series 7 with some famous Korean DJ inside, giving me lift all the way to [[Daejeon]] :)\n\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}'},
 'Shkodër': {'text': '\'\'\'Shkodër\'\'\' is the major city of northern [[Albania]]. You will likely pass through the city when passing to or from [[Montenegro]]. Throughout Albania the people are amazingly friendly, but in Shkodër they sometimes seem more so and you may elicit all kinds of positive reactions when thumbing.\n\n== Hitching out ==\n\n=== North towards [[Montenegro]] ===\n\nThere are two border crossings not far away from Shkodër. The first, Hani i Hotit, goes directly to [[Podgorica]]. To go this way, walk the SH1 towards the North and start thumbing as soon as you see a convenient spot where cars can stop. (For an example, see the coordinates in the comment below.) An alternative would be to take a minibus to the villages nearby in that direction like Shtoj or Boric.\n\nFor the other crossing towards Montenegro, taking you to [[Ulcinj]] and [[Bar]], just walk south along the main road SH1 until you reach an old wooden bridge. After crossing the bridge, turn left and walk a short distance until you reach a petrol station. Start thumbing from here.\n\nIn 2011 it was recommended to go via the southern road. However, later internet sources say that the construction of the Hani i Hotit road is finished and so traffic might be better there now. It is advisable to just ask local people about this issue.\nEdit: as of 2014, the road towards [[Podgorica]] up to Koplik is absolutely fine, and it probably is all the way to Podgorica. However, in summer it might be hard to find a ride hitching in this direction, as everyone will play taxi.\n\n[Update] [[User:Viniciuscastro]], December 2015: The road until Podgorica is fine and, even without being summer, a good amount of cars go in that direction (Hani i Hoti).\n\n[Update] [[User:Evolverine]], June 2016: I can also verify that the road to Hani i Hotit / [[Podgorica]] is good and that we (2 men) had an easy time getting a ride to the border, and then two more to [[Podgorica]]. We started near the "Sheshi Ura e Maxharrit" intersection:{{Coords|42.07913|19.51440}}.\n\n=== North towards [[Theth]] ===\nIf you are travelling towards Theth, follow the road to Podgorica until you reach Koplik and turn right at the roundabout. It might prove hard to hitchhike this way because of upcoming tourism in the area. There are plenty of people going up the mountain, but they will sometimes charge you up to 15 euros for the ride. However, if you are patient, you could manage to hitch all the way to Theth. \n\n=== South towards [[Tirana]] ===\n\nFollow the SH1 road south. As soon as you see the old wooden bridge (as described above) start hitching right after it. \'\'Do not\'\' cross it, as this would lead you to the road towards Montenegro. Keep in mind that there are a lot of minibuses and shared taxis going that way. This of course does not make normal drivers less helpful.\n[Update] [[User:Mediterranean]],October 2017 I took a walk from the city center to the place where road splits into two ways(two bridge)(40min walk aprox). It is very obvious witch one takes you to Tirana but if you dont use map and dont read signs then it is the left one(when coming from the center) or the more distant one. You can start hitchiking right before that bridge and i found it a really nice spot. After refusing couple of offers for money (yo pare-no money) i got a ride all the way to Tirana. It took me about an hour to hitchike and it was around 11am.\n\n== Accommodation and Sleep ==\n\nHospitality networks are not well represented in Albania. Still, you might have some luck with foreigners working in Shkoder for a period of time.\n\nThe train station seems to be closed at night.\n\nIf there is no other chance, the prices in the Stalinist hotel bunker in the center seem to be quite fair.\n\nTown also offers two hostels very near center for quite cheap price.\n\n== Alternatives ==\n\nIf you need a break from hitching or would enjoy a nice ride in a half-destroyed old fashioned train with local people, there is a train once daily for around 1€ to Tirana. Smashed windows, old Italian or German wagons and a locomotive from Czecheslovakia make this an unusual and cheap ride in Europe.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:bridgeshkoder.JPG|The brige towards Montenegro...\nFile:Benz.JPG|Old Mercedes Benz is still loved in Albania\n</gallery\n\n{{IsIn|Albania}}\n[[trash:Shkodër]]\n{{Category|Albania}}'},

Again a good spot just after a roundabout where cars will have plent of space to stop. If they are only going to Meppel, ask them if they can drop you off at exit 2, Meppel. The other two exits (Meppel-Noord and -Zuid) are much harder to get away from. If they are going to Zwolle, don\'t get off at Zwolle-Zuid! The other two on-ramps are perfect to continue hitching.\n\n====Option 2====\n{{Coords|52.7751|6.1691}}<br>\nAnother possibility is taking bus 40 or 48 to the stop \'\'Rotonde Havelterberg\'\'. This drops you off right at exit 5 \'\'Steenwijk-Zuid\'\'. Here\'s also a good spot in the direction of Zwolle, Both on-ramps are about equally frequented, and your choice will pretty much depend on your location in the city.\n\nThe on-ramp towards Leeuwarden at Steenwijk-Zuid is a bit harder to access because the road leading there is prohibited for pedestrians, but is also a good spot if you got dropped off here and don\'t want to walk through the whole city to the other on-ramp.\n\n== Hitching in ==\n{{Coords|52.7750|6.1685}}<br>\nIf you\'re dropped off at exit 5 (Zuid), walk to the roundabout west of the motorway. There\'s a bus stop there from where you can try to hitch a ride into the city, as going by foot means a 4km walk to the centre. In general it\'s pretty easy to get a ride into the city.\n\n== Wild camping ==\n\nLuckily enough there are some great places for wild camping close to the motorway. If you\'re at exit 6, walk along the \'\'Onderduikersweg\'\', an unpaved road parallel to the motorway, until it makes a sharp right turn. About 50m after that there\'s a trail leading left into the forest. It\'s a brief 750m walk to the beginning of the trail from the motorway.\n\nFrom the roundabout at exit 5, walk south on the \'\'Meppelerweg\'\'. After 500m cross under the motorway using the tunnel for cyclists. Keep going straight until you enter \'\'\'Havelterberg\'\'\' and then turn left on the \'\'Haarweg\'\'. This road eventually becomes unpaved after 500m and then leads into the forest. Be aware that this forest is a military training ground, though not much will happen if you camp at the edges of the forest.

Drivers can take you at least to petrol station on the border and you can cross the border on foot and start hitchhiking just after Hungarian passport control.

The city is a famous haven for car manufacturers and thus it\'s surroundings are not exactly beautiful once outside of the city centre. However, there are plenty of fields to sleep in, public transport is cheap and the pizza is superb.\n__NOTOC__\n== Hitching out ==\n\n=== West towards [[Chambéry]], [[Lyon]], [[Grenoble]] ([[France]]) ===\nThe best way is starting from the petrol station "Rivoli Nord", in Alpignano town, in which you can get very easily. Take the bus 32 (ticket "biglietto interurbano", costs less than 2 euros) and go till the headline "Robotti". From there take \'\'Via Rivoli\'\' and walk it down till the end (more or less 1 km). Right before the highway there is a a small country road on the left which goes along the highway. It will take you directly to the petrol station. Once there you just have to follow the fence until you reach the revolving doors. Another way to get here if coming from \'\' Mezcal squat\'\' in \'\'Colegno\'\' is by train from the Colegno train stop and by getting of at the next one in Alpignano. Coming out of the train station you are already on Via Rivoli. \n\nOn the {{Ait|32}} [[E70]] in Susa (about 20km from Torino), there is a truck stop (with petrol station and restaurant) where you will find a lot of trucks going both ways to [[Chambéry]] or [[Turin]]. You can get in Susa by train and the spot worth the effort.\n\nAn efficient way to get a ride westwards is to get to the toll (pedaggio in Italian) at Bruere. Take a bus to Macario stop on Corso Francia and walk along Via Bruere until you across the bridge and see the tollgate on your left. Get off the road and walk through the maize field along the motorway direction, you will see the toll office. There is a rail fence which is easy to climb over, other places along the edge are splitted by net fences. Stand by the outmost toll ramp with a sign indicate your direction and waiting for your ride. A service area is just 1km ahead.\n\n=== East and South ===\nThe best way is starting from the petrol station "Nichelino sud", in Nichelino town, in which you can get very easily. Take the bus 35 (ticket "biglietto interurbano", costs less than 2 euros) and go till the stop "Torino". Than you have to walk for something like 1,5-2km following: Via Torino (keep it for approx 100m), Via Gozzano (keep it for approx 1km), turn left on via Vernea (keep it for approx 100m) turn left on Via Napoli. After 50m you\'ll see a small country road which takes you directly in the petrol station. There\'s no fence to climb.\n\n=== North ===\n{{Coords|45.1288|7.6906}}<br>\nThere is a gas station called "Stazione di Servizio ENI" thats on the {{Ait|55}} north of Turin. A lot of traffic goes towards [[Milano]], but there are some cars going north towards [[Aosta]] / [[Bern]] / [[Germany]].\nYou can reach the gas station by public transport and walking. Take a bus or a local train to the train station Turino Stura. From there its a 2,5 km walk. This is the adress of the gas station: Tangenziale Nord, KM 16,315, 10156 Torino.

Toulouse\'s bypass is complicated, so try to change vehicles at a [[péage]] when entering the motorway. If you change at the exit péage before entering the Toulouse bypass a lot of passing traffic won\'t be going the same way as you.\n\n== Hitchhiking out ==\n\n=== North towards [[Bordeaux]], [[Agen]], [[Limoges]], [[Paris]] {{E|9}} {{E|72}} {{Afr|62}} ===\n\nOption #1: to get directly to the toll (\'\'péage\'\') starting the highway A62. From the metro station "La Vache" (Metro line 2), take the bus 29/60/69/105, get off at "Lapin", walk ahead (on Avenue de Front) for about 75 meters and take the first left (Chemin du Lapin) until you reach a pedestrian bridge. From there you can jump across a small barrier, get in something that looks like a small abandoned field and walk along ahead for about 100 meters. You\'ll see a one-way northbound motorway connection road to what will become the péage after about 500 meters. You want to walk along that portion, staying as much as possible on the right side of the safety barrier (not very dangerous actually, but if the police see you, they won\'t stop to annoy you). In my opinion (Hertinek, aka Uncle_Franek), this is the ultimate option to hitch north out of Toulouse. I\'ve lived in the area almost all my life, and have experienced many different spots. Today I always use this one. Two busstops after "Lapin" you can leave the bus at stop "Lapparou" as well, walk ahead 50 meters, turn left Impasse des Horticulteurs at the end of which you will find a red wall and fence which you need to climb over, which is probably possible as the fence is damaged - this way you are only a few meters from the péage, which then saves you from walking along the motorway for half a kilometer. Take a HUGE sign with you as the toll is large. \n\nOption #2 : a smaller peage but maybe easier to reach (I had to get there because there were policemen and higway employees at the main one), from the subway station La Vache, take the bus 69 toward Bruguières, then stop at Pont rouge, you\'ll need to walk a few hundred meters, cross the bridge and you\'ll be at Saint Jory\'s peage, I got a ride to Agen waiting just a few minutes.\n\nOption #3: you can walk to the entrance of the "périphérique" (ring road) at Pont Jumeaux as well (10mns walk from metro Canal du Midi), there are 2 traffic lights there. Easy to go there (plus standing at the péage might be forbidden), nice spot, but took me like 1 hour to get a ride, both times.\n\nOption #4: REALLY EASY. A really good idea is to take the metro to Balma Gramont, from there, 5 min away there is a ramp entrance to the "périphérique", a lots of cars go in that direction, cars can easily see you and stop, you can find people going torwards Bordeaux(A62) Montauban/Paris(A20) or Albi (A68). I\'ve hitchhiked several times there any day any time of year and sometimes I\'ve not been alone, there are often other hitchhikers going out Notrh from Toulouse there (especially during the summer). The big advantage is that you\'ll get there really easily, compared to the time it takes you to go to the péages, and if the person that stops isn\'t going in your direction they can always leave you at a péage. So if you\'re heading anywhere North of Toulouse you can think of starting at Balma.\n\n=== Northeast, towards [[Albi]] {{AutorouteFR|68}} ===\nTake metro line B to stop Borderouge, then change bus 40 or 73 or walk to stop Atlanta. Just walk along the Route d\'Albi to the road sign post before the road splits to ramp onto A62 and hitch with a sign. The passing traffic goes to Albi via D888 or A68.\n\n=== The [[Péage]] towards the East/South-East (Carcassonne, Narbonne, Perpignan, Montpellier) {{AutorouteFR|61}} ===\n\n\n\'\'\'Option 1\'\'\'\n\nTake metro line B in the direction \'\'Ramonville\'\' to the very last stop. Then,\n*hitch from the park and ride parking lot, asking people to bring you to the péage or to the first service area, Toulouse-sud, 11 km further, or\n*hitch from the roundabout: turn left at the traffic circle just out the metro station. Follow the \'\'autoroute/Montpellier\'\' or \'\'Carcassonne\'\' signs to the entrance of the motorway; it\'s the first exit on the right of the second roundabout, or\n*get to the péage \'\'\'on foot\'\'\': the -péage is only 2km further than the roundabout.\n\n\'\'\'Option 2: Canal du Midi near the Jardin du Grand Rond\'\'\'\n\nThis street leads directly to the highway A61. You can wait next to the small bridge over the canal, there\'s a bus-stop so cars can easily stop. From here you can get to the rest station 5 km after the big péage, from where you can continue towards the Mediterranean. This is the fastest way for cars getting from the centre on the higyway, so there\'s always a lot of traffic. \'\'go to this point from Ferme Pédagogique de Cinquante (Maps)\'\' {{Coords|43.5411536|1.5012752|1}}\n\n\'\'\'Option 3\'\'\'\n\nThere is a small \'\'petrol station on the highway\'\' {{Coords|43.59418|1.39711|1}} in town, before the split towards either Andorra or Carcassonne. To get there, you can take Linéo 3 or bus 67 to Pont Rocade, walk across the highway and turn right immediately, or Linéo 2 to Castanet. There\'s not heaps of traffic, and much of it stays in town, but it\'s definitely possible to get rides in either of the major directions. \n\n==== Towards [[Carcassonne]], [[Montpellier]], [[Barcelona]] ([[Spain]]) ====\n\nMost of the cars are going this way, you should get a ride in a few minutes. The Raimonville metro station (line B) is very close to one of the roundabouts that lead to the highway (A61). \n\nOtherwise, the first toll of the highway is 30 minutes walking from there and offers higher chances.\n\n==== Towards [[Foix]], [[Andorra]] ====\n\nAbout 20 kilometres after the péage the motorway splits, with most traffic going on to Montpellier.\nThe best way is to get to the rest station 5 kilometres after the péage. There you can continue searching for drivers. A sign reading \'\'direction Foix\'\' can be useful.<br />\nIf the driver is not going all the way to Foix or Andorra, he might be able to drop you off at the péage \'\'Pamiers\'\', from which one can easily continue on.\n\n=== Towards [[Tarbes]], [[Pau]], [[Bayonne]]  on highway {{AutorouteFR|64}} ===\n\nThere is a toll gate near the small town of Roques, on the highway A64 direction Tarbes/Pau/Bayonne. Take the red Metro to Baso Cambo (last stop) then bus line 50 from Baso Cambo to Roques Acacias (last stop) (buses every 30min at the most, careful not all line 50 buses go to Acacias!)\n\nFrom the stop, walk in the direction the bus came from, through a small lot, following the sound of the motorway (you can hear it). After a while you have to climb over a small grassy knoll, and you arrive on a \'\'route nationale\'\', parallel to the motorway, and from the top of the hump you can see the toll gate in the distance. Walk along the \'\'route nationale\'\' to your right until you arrive at a roundabout. Go left, over the bridge that crosses the motorway, you\'re now on the right side, follow the motorway to the toll gate. If no cops are around and you feel lucky you can hitch from the inter-lane spaces (effective but illegal...) or otherwise go to the small service-area just behind (no petrol pumps but people do stop occasionally, and you can always wave a thumb at passing cars).\n\nOther Option: Take bus 58 from Basso-Cambo to "Centre de détention" (there are not many so check the schedules, but some terminates only at "Seysse maison d\'arrêt" or "Seysse Gay", it also works but the walk will be longer). From there walk 10min to the entrance of the motorway https://goo.gl/maps/b9bkxUH2xqB2 . All the traffic that wants to avoid the toll (péage) will enter here as the motorway becomes free and there is a good place to stop for the cars. You can easily find a lift to the petrol station 20km down or further away.\n\nYou can also walk directly from the Metro station Basso Cambo or even better Bellefontaine to the highway entrance. From there, you can find a ride to the péage. Even cars exiting the motorway before the \'\'péage\'\' to go to Roques or Muret will be able to drop you on the \'\'route nationale\'\' very close to the péage.\n\n=== Towards [[Auch]], N124 ===\nThere is a spot at the [[roundabout]] just in front on the Purpan Hospital (a bunch of public transport stop there).\n\n== Metro ==\nIf you are on a low budget: The security at the entry of the metro stations is watching for people who enter, that they validate their tickets. Even if they are there you can ask them friendly if they let you enter without ticket as you don\'t have much money. Worked with me 3 of 4 times, basically outside the very centre of the city. In the centre they are more strict and you need to be careful when you change the lines there.\n\n== Wild camping ==\n\nYou can pitch a tent north of the soccer field on the Pech-David hill south of Toulouse.

For Ding-semester ticket holders it\'s free. Walk over the train tracks and river and take road "Sägeweg" to the Autobahn [[A7 (Germany)|A7]].

It is one of the oldest cities in the Netherlands, dating back from Roman times. Today, it has a population of over 300,000. While being a nice travel destination on its own, boasting a very picturesque inner city and hosting many events throughout the year, it also serves as one of the major transport hubs of the Netherlands. The ''Ring Utrecht'' is composed of the A27 North/South, the start/end of the A28, the A12 West/East, the A2 North/South, and the N230 connecting the A27 and A2 motorways. While the motorway maze around Utrecht might seem complicated, it is generally easy to hitch in and out of the city, as long as you know where the good spots are. \n\n== Hitchhiking out ==\n=== North to [[Amsterdam]]===\n{{Coords|52.0802|5.0870}}<br>\nThe (arguably) best place to get a ride to Amsterdam is near the ''24 Oktoberplein'' in ''Kanaleneiland'', where the flyover comes down to the traffic lights. Taking any tram for Central Station, get out at ''24 Oktoberplein'', walk back to the traffic square, pass underneath the flyover and make an immediate left. Follow the road until the flyover comes down, and position yourself on the small shoulder between the two traffic lights. Absolutely awesome place. Also works well for going south!\n\n=== South to [[Breda]], [[Belgium]], East to [[ Amersfoort]],[[Germany]] ===\n{{Coords|52.0798|5.1435}}<br>\nThere is a [[liftershalte]] - a special spot for hitchhiking - at the ramp of the ''Waterlinieweg'' near ''De Galgewaard'' stadium. It's good for going northwards on the A27 and A28 (on the right when coming from Galgewaard Stadium) or southwards on the A12, A2 and A27 (crossed the highway on the left when coming from Galgewaard Stadium, indicated by a BP gas station). Official hitching spot, indicated by a traffic sign with a thumb on it. \nTo get there, take bus 12 from the Central Station and get off at bus stop 'Stadion Galgewaard'. Cross the road and you're at the sliproad!\n\n(Note: as of April 28th 2019 the bus 12 does not run on Sundays however another bus [if I remember correctly the 41] does go to the same stop.)\n\nAlternatively, you can take bus 55 in the direction ''Maartensdijk'' and get off at the stop ''Nieuwe wetering''. From there you are able to walk to a petrol station directly on the A27. Beware though, you have to walk for about 1 kilometer next to the motorway and a hitchhiker once got a 90€ fine for that, but otherwise it's a great starting place to go south direction [[Paris]] (A27) as well as [[Luxembourg]] (A2) (Note: Looking at the satellite image on Google Maps, there seems to be some bushes between the A27 and the railway parallel to it, walking in this strip as far as possible from the A27 '''may''' just keep you out of view!)\n\nAlso, you can reach a petrol station on the west side of Nieuwegein, on the A2 highway. Take any tram from Utrecht Central Station, get out at Nieuwegein Stadscentrum, and walk along the Wijkerslootweg in the direction of the A2 highway (be careful, there is no sidewalk, only vegetation you'll have to walk through, and cars pass by fast, but it's perfectly doable). Cross the highway (there is a sidewalk on the bridge), take the first right after the bridge, and take another right at the little pedestrian roundabout up ahead. Then, keep walking until the petrol station appears on your right. You're already at the front end of the station by now. There's a low fence you can easily step over and walk into the station. Stepping over the fence is probably technically illegal as you enter part of the highway, but you can step over and walk in in just 10 seconds, and you circumvent the creek running round the station. From here, you can hitch to either southwest (A2) or southeast (A27).\n\n=== East towards [[Arnhem]] and Germany ===\n{{Coords|52.0618|5.1786}}<br>\nTo go east, direction [[Arnhem]] and Germany, the best thing to do is to take the train from central station to [[Bunnik]] (6 minutes), cross the footbridge across the highway, and walk along the highway back towards where you just came from for 2 kilometers. This petrol station, ''De Forten'',on the A12 is a good spot to find rides towards Arnhem. (From this place it is also possible to go to direction Berlin if you take the A50 north near Arnhem.) \n\nIn addition, the abovementioned liftplaats at Stadion Galgewaard is also a viable place for hitchhiking east towards Arnhem/Germany.\n\n=== West [[Rotterdam]],[[The Hague]] ===\n{{Coords|52.0606|5.1056}}<br>\nGet down to ''Kanaleneiland'' in the southwest corner of Utrecht, for instance by taking any tram leaving from Utrecht Central Station. Get out at ''Kanaleneiland Zuid''. Walk towards the A12 highway. There's an entry lane leading up to the A12 on your right hand side where there's ample room for cars to stop on the hard shoulder. \n\nAlternatively, try the spot near the 24 Oktoberplein as mentioned above. Although the road directly leads to the North/Southbound A2, you can find people going west on the A12. (I tried this myself and it worked)\n\n== Sleeping ==\nFor wild camping, it's best to stay at the university area (De Uithof). Take bus 28 or 12 from the main train station in Utrecht (Utrecht Centraal Station) and you will know where to get out when you see the large school buildings. There are great spots to camp there and little to no guards. It's pretty far away from the city center, so you should be able to sleep pretty safe there.\n\nAlternatively you can ask the friendly people at the local vegan café if they know anywhere you can stay for free:\n''ACU, Voorstraat 71'', vegan food on donation basis is served on Saturdays, and Sundays.\n\n== Other useful info ==\n\n=== Free Internet ===\n\nThe main Library in Utrecht has a computer that you can use without paying for the internet. It's on the second floor, and as you face the room, there is a row of three computers in front of you (but behind the desk of the person who works there). The one that works for free is at the end of the row on the right from the perspective of sitting at the computer.\n\nThe library in the university area (Uithof) also has some computers with free internet. Enter the area by the Heidelberglaan, this is the street with only buses on it. There are two buildings above the road. The second building (coming from the city centre) is connected to the library. The north of this building is connected to the computer rooms, which have a few computers with free internet, and don't require you to log in. \n\nA pilot project until the end of 2013 offers free wifi at Vredenburg, Stadhuisplein and Domplein. Network name: 'Free Wifi Utrecht'.\n\nAs of Sep 2013 free wifi at central station on the KPN network as well as on  [http://www.ns.nl/over-ns/nieuwscentrum/nieuwsberichten/2013/09/ns-biedt-in-samenwerking-met-kpn-gratis-wifi-op-stations-aan.html  48 train stations in NL].\n\n[http://www.openwifispots.com/country-city_free_wifi_wireless_hotspot-Utrecht_NL.aspx  Free hotspots in Utrecht (unverified)].\n\n\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n<!--Infoboxes and categories.

Leave the bus at St Christophe stop. Then you'll have to walk about 1 km. Keep to the left side on the street Jean Jaures and then follow the road going to the left. The pavement ends here but there is a wide roadside. You'll get to a roundabout from which you can hitchhike. This is the exit from the motorway services back to the highway, apart from that you'll get some people entering the highway from the local zone.

The city itself is a collection of islands.  You will probably arrive and leave through \'\'\'Mestre\'\'\'.\n== Getting around ==\nPublic transport in Venice centre is extremely overpriced (7,50 for an one-way ticket). No worry, as you can walk almost everywhere excluding the islands (Giudecca, Lido..) to which you have to take a water bus. However you can blackride (quite easy from what we heard, almost no ticket checkings), and hitchhiking private and cargo boats is also possible. Ferries, gondolas, and water taxis will probably not take you. We stood on the bank of Canale Giudecca close to the railway station with a big sign saying "Giudecca" and waved at boats - we got a ride to G. in around 15 mins. On the way back it took us around 1 hour to get a ride, but thats still decent.\n== Hitchhiking out ==\n\nLeaving the city can be a drag so better prepare the whole day for that. You can catch a ride from [http://maps.google.it/maps?ll=45.441102,12.315366&spn=0.007242,0.01929&z=16&lci=com.google.webcams&layer=c&cbll=45.441102,12.315366&panoid=ODp2EZxJb52sSOx1mJcf4w&cbp=12,30.75,,0,0 the start of the bridge], but avoid short rides to Mestre. Hitching out of Mestre is really hard, maybe taking a short train ride to better place is the best option. If you arrive by plane at Marco Polo Airport do NOT catch the local bus (lines 5, 15, 45, 45H) inside for €8,  walk 10 min and head outside of the airport to this point [[{{Coords|45.5039466|12.3300867}}]] stop name "Tessera Centro". From there you catch the exact same bus for €1.50 buying the ticket from the kiosk in front of the bus stop, right from the hotel (or blackriding).\n\n=== West towards [[Verona]], [[Bologna]] ===\n\nTake bus 6 to the Via Petro Paleocapa in Marghera, walk to the roundabout, through the Via Cesare Begharia and through the Via de la Ponte on the right. At the very end, there\'s a path on the right to the AGIP petrol station. It\'s far from perfect but at its exit you can hitch both people from the petrol station or try to get someone over from the roundabout. Also possible to go east here if you are already in the eastern part (e.g. stayed at Camping Jolly, 500m from there).\n\n\nAlternatively, you can take a local train from the station in Mestre to Padova for around 2 Euro.  It takes 40 minutes and will put you in the center of Padova.  From there, see the [[Padova|article on Padova]].  The petrol station/truck complex is huge and busy, a great place to hitch from in either direction.\n\n=== East towards [[Trieste]], [[Udine]], [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]] ===\n\nIf you are already in Marghera, see above.\n\n\nOption 1\n\nTake bus 2 to the last stop, \'\'Viale don Sturzo\'\', go to \'\'Via Vallon\'\' and go to the end of the street where you will find a small path leading to the AGIP fuel station on the motorway [[http://goo.gl/IvItP]]\n\nYou have to go to the end of Via Vallon - it is not a straight street and is not short. It turns, goes under the rails and then goes through fields (you need to walk for about 40 minutes) and finally leads to the highway. Walk about 200 metres along the highway and there is the AGIP station.   \n\n\n\nOption 2\n\nGoing to Trieste was very easy for me and my friend as we just got to Marco Polo Airport by bus number 5 from Piazzale Roma from Venice. It takes just a moment and one way ticket costs 1,5 euro. Just go off the bus on the last stop on Marco Polo Airport and start walking east (when you stand in front of bus stop go left along the street and then through the openair parking) until you reach the roundabout with direction Trieste on the right side. Before the roundabout there\'s a great spot to stand next to the street and cars can easily stop\n\n== Going To Marco Polo Airport  ==\n\n\nWhen you go to buy a bus ticket from Venice (Piazelle Roma) to the Marco Polo airport  they will charge €8 or €8.50. Instead, ask for a ticket to Tessera, which is one stop before the airport and costs only €1.50 to get on the exact same bus (#5).

Continue on your right down the main street, Brünner Str (road no.&nbsp;7); go past the Billa Plus supermarket until you come to another shopping centre, about 300&nbsp;m further. Hitchhike right after the entrance to the parking lot. \n\nYou can use a sign "Brno", but if you don\'t get a lift after 30 minutes, then just hitchhike without a sign and ask any driver to take you to Wolkersdorf or Mistelbach. There is a huge petrol station 5&nbsp;km north of Wolkersdorf and from there it is easy to find a lift into the Czech Republic.\n\n====Option 2====\n\nTake the [https://www.g3-shopping.at/services/bus-shuttle-s11150/ free bus to G3 Shopping Center] . The Bus starts from the regional buses\' stop in front of the "Floridsdorf Bahnhof" train station, they depart in 30 minute intervals, more frequently during Fridays/Saturdays, first bus at 08:00am. If you do make the terrible mistake of taking the local bus instead of the free one, it will cost you 4.20 euro and you can\'t black-ride, as it\'s paid to the driver. From where the bus stops, cross the parking lot towards the big street that the bus had taken out of Vienna and cross that street. There is a petrol station "Eni" (the yellow one) and next to that there is a free, unused lane for cars and trucks to stop easily. [https://goo.gl/maps/a9pXqeusHft GoogleMaps Footpath]\n\n=== East towards [[Bratislava]], [[Győr]] and [[Budapest]] {{Aat|4}} {{European Route Number|60}} ===\n\nThere is an OMV [[petrol station hitchhiking|petrol station]] with a McD on the motorway to Budapest where you can easily find a ride to Bratislava, [[Hungary]] or further.\n\nTo get to this petrol station by public transport, take metro line U3 to \'\'Enkplatz\'\' and from there you can take a bus 76A to \'\'7.&nbsp;Haidequerstraße\'\' (the bus stop is on the other side of the street at the intersection when you leave the metro station). Be careful because there are two stops with almost the same name, \'\'7.&nbsp;Haidequerstraße\'\' and \'\'11.&nbsp;Haidequerstraße\'\' – get off at the first one, which comes after the stop \'\'Simmeringer Haide\'\'. After the stop, the bus turns right, but to get to the petrol station, walk straight on on to the north for just 200&nbsp;m. The petrol station is on the [[A4 (Austria)|A4]] highway towards Bratislava, Győr and Budapest. Once you have reached the petrol station, just wait near the entrance and ask drivers entering the shop.\n\nNote: Watch out for Romanian drivers who may attempt to charge you for the ride; make sure before you accept a lift from a Romanian driver that you are not going to pay by saying e.g. \'\'E gratis? / N-am bani sa va dau.\'\' ‘\'\'"Is the lift free? / I can\'t pay.’\n\nMost of the cars passing in this petrol station are coming off the motorway or going to the airport. You can get more cars going to [[Slovakia]] or [[Hungary]] if you take the first ride to the next petrol station on the motorway, named Göttlesbrunn, which is just before road splits into the E58 towards Bratislava and the E60 towards Budapest. The E60 road enters Hungary at the [[Hegyeshalom-Nickelsdorf border crossing]].\n\nIf your ultimate destination is [[Romania]], then ask your driver to leave you at the [[Hegyeshalom-Nickelsdorf border crossing]] and hitch from there with a sign Romania\n\n\n=== South towards [[Graz]], [[Slovenia]], [[Zagreb]] {{Aat|2}}===\n\n===Option 1: Triesterstraße, highly recommended===\n\nWith the completion of the construction site the hitchspot at the [https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2043915283 onramp from Triesterstraße] is open again.\n\nThere is a lot of space to stop. On empty streets cars will go 70km/h but they are slower (<50km/h) when there is more traffic (during most of the day). There is also street light and a bridge in case of night or rain. There is even a small section of gras with trees where you can camp. Public transport: Badner Bahn from Wien Meidling, station Wien Inzersdorf, ~5 min walk. A regular Vienna City Ticket (2,40€ in 2020) is sufficient.\n\nThere are several places beforehand on Triesterstraße where people tried hitchhiking. Triesterstraße / Computerstraße, public transport: Bus 16a from U6 Am Schöpfwerk. Triesterstraße / Herta-Firnberg-Straße, you can only ask people - no thumbing, includes a McDonalds and a gas station, public transport: Bus 7B from train station Wien Meidling\n\n===Option 2: ===\n\nOther option if you want to pay EUR 3.40 for the train then take the \'\'Badener Bahn\'\' to \'\'Maria-Enzersdorf (Südstadt)\'\' Advantages of the latter one: it goes more often and earlier in the morning than the bus. If you take the train, you can go to one station after \'\'Shopping City Süd\'\' which is called \'\'Maria-Enzersdorf (Südstadt)\'\'. This one is closer to the actual [[slip road|interchange]]: just get off the train, head the direction you came from, turn right by the end of the platform, cross the tracks, pass 100 m of wild grass and there is a curved street – you\'ll see the signs.\n\nAlternatively you can take public transport to \'\'Matzleinsdorfer Platz\'\' where the \'\'Triester Straße\'\' begins [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Triester+Stra%C3%9Fe+2,+Vienna,+%C3%96sterreich&aq=0&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=26.674078,56.513672&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Triester+Stra%C3%9Fe+2,+Favoriten+1100+Wien,+Austria&z=15] (direction South-West). This road is extremely long but it has on-ramps for heading South ([[Graz]]). Try hitching along this road, or ask at the petrol station. If you keep walking down there is a perfect place for hitchhiking where cars take the exit and join the highway. There is a lot of grass and a perfect place with enough room for even a truck to stop.\n\n===Option 3: Grünbergstraße / Altmannsdorfer Straße===\n\nIf you are OK with hitchhiking at traffic lights, you can also just go to "Schönbrunn" with U4 (underground – green line). Cross the street and walk towards the entrance of Schönbrunn-castle. Now you are on "Grünbergstraße". Here you can try to hitchhike from the traffic lights. This street leads to "Altmannsdorfer Straße" which leads to A2 (the motorway leading to the south)\n\nFor everyone going to Slovenia or Zagreb, know that there are no petrol station on your side of the road some 100 kilometres before Graz. The first one is near Leibnitz, some 15-20 km after Graz. So if someone offers you a ride to Graz, try to see if they\'re maybe going to Leibnitz or past Leibnitz. There are many people from Maribor working in Graz, so if you end up in Graz, try using a sign for Maribor on roads going out of the city towards the highway. The petrol station near Leibnitz is on the way to Maribor.\n\n== Hitchhiking in ==\n\n\'\'\'From [[Germany]]\'\'\'\n\nMost of the traffic going through [[Passau]] is heading East to [[Linz]], [[Vienna]], [[Budapest]] while most of the traffic going through [[Salzburg]] is heading South to [[Trieste]], [[Italy]], [[Slovenia]], [[Balkans]].\n\nYou should then seriously consider coming by the E56 (even if you come from southern Germany).\n\n\'\'\'From East, West\'\'\'\n\nIf your driver heads to [[Slovakia]] ([[Bratislava]]), [[Hungary]] or the eastern [[Balkans]] they\'ll pass the Airport at "Schwechat". There is public transportation, of course, but if you are in the departure area there are a lot of drivers emptying their cars before going back to the city.\n\nIf you find yourself in a car that is passing through Vienna on the eastern ring road, try getting out around the Donau island (German: \'\'Donauinsel\'\'), close to the river. From here you can walk to a metro-station that usually heads directly towards the centre of Vienna.\n\nYou will often find yourself, especially at night, on the E60 passing south of Vienna. I dont know if trucks can go there since you have to go through an underpass: Jump out at the exit "Campus 21"/"Breitenfurterstrasse" \'\'GoogleMaps\'\' {{Coords|48.116017|16.2891633|1}}. Take care since it is an exit with 2 exits, you should keep as right as possible! About 100m further there is a roundabout where you can jump out and the car can get directly back to the highway. From that roundabout it is about 3km to the next U-Bahn, the final stop of U6. I found this to be the shortest way to get to public transport. If you come at night, there is a so called ASTAX, you call a number, and from the moment when there are enough people that want to go a small bus comes and picks you up, you pay by buying a regular ticket ([http://www.wienerlinien.at/media/download/2015/ASTAX_N64_141310.pdf Number, Schedule, ... in German]). The ASTAX will bring you to the night bus N64 that is driving through basically all Vienna ([http://www.netzplanwien.at/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Nachtnetz-Wien_20131215.pdf map in German for public nightlines in Vienna]).\n\n== Public transport ==\n\nIt is possible to ride the subway, bus, and tram system with no ticket, though at your own risk. Buses and trams are almost never controlled (except night buses and in the first month of each semester, e.g. October and March), but checks on the metro are rather frequent. Also they check trams around center.The fine is EUR 103, but foreigners can give a fake address in their home country and avoid paying.\n\nThe Wiener Linien themselves provide information on where their ticket inspectors are riding on any given day (https://www.wienerlinien.at/web/wiener-linien/kontrollen). It is unsure how reliable this information is, so be careful anyway.\n\nAnother website where the passengers tell of where and when they have seen controllers is http://schwarzkappler.info/, with information for major Austrian cities and some German cities as well, with Facebook and Twitter pages.\n\n== Sleeping == \n\n\'\'\'Option 1: Erdberg\'\'\'\n\nTake line U3 of the metro to the station \'\'Erdberg\'\'. Exit the station, then walk 300 m southeast to the pedestrian bridge over the railway tracks. This pedestrian bridge will bring you over the railway tracks, the Danube canal and the motorway. On the other side, behind a few houses, there is a vast park where you can pitch a tent. You can even sleep late, as in the mornings the only passers-by are joggers and riders on horseback.\n\n[[File:Vienna-erdberg-sleeping.png|200px|thumb|left|The walk from Vienna\'s U3 metro station Erdberg to a park for camping.]]\n\n\'\'\'Option 2: Park Prater\'\'\'\n\nAlmost the same as Erdberg but a lot closer to the city centre, you can camp in the Prater Park / Jesuitenwiese. There are plenty of wells and a free toilet. Sometimes people party here, but they wont bother you. In the Hundezone you can find hidden spots in a forest like area.\n\nIt\'s about a 30 min walk from Stadtpark.\n\n\'\'\'Other options\'\'\'\n\nI\'ve been told that sleeping at the Donau is possible too, even on the Donauinsel. If you\'re looking for a quick option in th North, check out the university and its benches (when visiting during the holidays).\n\n\'\'\'A safe option for the winter time\'\'\'\nAlternatively, if you need to stay warm during the cold season, the Airport is easily reachable (didn’t get checked for a ticket on the train) and is pretty sleeping-friendly - nobody bothered me or wanted to see a boarding ticket or so.\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\nAs Nomadwiki is down here is [https://web.archive.org/web/20210618003818/http://nomadwiki.org/en/Vienna a link to an archived version].\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n\n\n{{IsIn|Austria}}\n\n{{Hitchhiking Zine nomination}}\n\n\n[[Category:Austria]]\n[[Category:E60]]\n[[Category:E59]]\n[[Category:E58]]\n[[Category:E49]]\n[[Category:E461]]\n\n[[de:Wien]]\n[[tr:Viyana]]'},

The road is first called Rynek, later Biskupica, and the road number is 720. Keep following it until you pass the A2 with a tunnel, then take the first road left and follow it until the service station. The distance to walk is about 3.5 km.Google maps ''link here'' {{Coords|52.1555185|20.6843505|1}}\n\nAlternative way: bus 743 from Cmentarz Wolski  till Wolica Plochocina end stop and than walk to Biskupice 5 km (look a bus stop list some buses goes to other final stop)\n\n====Option 3, S8 onramp Warszawa Zachód====\n{{Coords|52.2161|20.8629}}<br>\nThis option involves the least walking and is quite close to the city centre and the western districts. To get there you have two different possibilities:\n\nA. Take the tram 8, 10, 26 direction ''Os. Górczewska'' and get off at ''Ciepłownia Wola''. There you can get in the bus 713 and get off at ''Mory'' (The first stop on public transport zone 2 (''strefa II'')). Walk back around 200m in the direction your bus came from, until the on-ramp of the A2 snd hitchike there\n\nB.  Especially during rush hour, there is a faster way to get to the on-ramp at the A2: Take the ''KM3'' train in direction of [[Łowicz]] or [[Sochaczew]] (sometimes only going to [[Błonie]]) and get of at the station ''Gołąbki''. From the pedestrian crossing over the tracks you can already spot the highway's noise barrier to the north-west. Follow the road on the northern side of the train station to the north, turn right at the next crossing and the road should lead you through an under-bridge under the highway after a couple of minutes. After, you cross the road and arrive at the on-ramp described under ''#1''. The whole walk is around 1,5km.\n\nYou can take the trains from platform #3 at ''Warszawa Śródmieście'' which is next to the Central Station\n\n====Option 4, S2 bus stop on the entry to bypass from southern part of the city==== \n{{Coords|52.1398|21.0161}}<br>\nTake the bus from metro station ''Wilanowska'' to the stop ''Żołny'' (lines 319, 709, 715, 727, 739). Then go back a bit to the direction you arrived under the overpass and turn left. There is a place where a lot of the southern inhabitants of Warsaw go to A2. There is an unused bus stop on the highway entrance. There is enough space to stop a truck. The drivers will come around the bend, but if you stay at the end of the bus stop they will go slow enough and they will have much time to see you and stop. It is a great place to catch direct car to [[Łódź]], to [[Poznań]] or even [[Gdańsk]] you can change on the service station (MOP) ''Nowosady'' (there are Burger King and Shell gas station), if the driver comes to Łódź and you want to go west or north it is important to left before A1 and A2 junction.\n\n====Option 5, National road 92 slower option==== \n{{Coords|52.2103|20.7997}}<br>\nIf you wish to take the old main road DK92 (not advisable if you want to travel fast...) you can use a place which takes a bit more time to reach:\n\nTake the ''KM3'' train in direction of [[Łowicz]] or [[Sochaczew]] and get out at ''Ożarów Mazowiecki''. \n\nWhen you get out at the station in ''Ożarów Mazowiecki'' (make sure you keep an eye out for the correct station, Ożarów Mazowiecki only has one sign at the end of the station) just leave the station to the right (facing away from Warsaw) and follow ''Marii Konopnickiej'' Street until you reach a bigger street, ''Poznańska'' (about 500m). Another few hundred meters to the East you will find a bus stop with plenty of space to stop (it's across the street from the church). It's just one lane, cars are going quite slow and you avoid a great deal of local traffic out of Warsaw. Even though this is the old main road to the West and some drivers (especially trucks) take it to avoid the highway fees, it will probably take longer than using the highway.\n\n=== South towards [[Radom]], [[Kielce]], [[Kraków]] {{National Road Number Poland|7}} {{E|77}} ===\n{{Coords|52.1394|20.9018}}<br>\nGet tram 7, 9, 35 from the city centre e.g ''Aleje Jerozolimskie'', ''Warszawa Centralna'' (Main Train Station), ''Centrum'' (Warsaw Metro station) going in the direction of ''P+R Aleja Krakowska'' and get off at the last stop. Then, take bus 707, 728, 807  to ''Janki'', or bus N88, 706 or 807 to ''Plac Szwedzki'' (a stop near ''Janki'' and in front of an IKEA store) and walk back to the stop ''Janki''.\n\nFrom the stop ''Janki'', note that the road splits. The Aleja Krakowska road going left will cointinue on E77 highway. Place next to Aleja Krakowska street 5 has nice place to hitchike. Using a large sign can be very effective.\n\n As of 2020, there's new piece of S8 expressway, which goes around Janki. You can go to ''P+R Aleja Krakowska'' as mentioned before. From there take bus 721 in direction of ''Kosów'' or 728 towards ''Złotokłos''. You can go out on stop ''Sękocin Las'' (Second one, after the crossing & joining with main road. There are two stops with same name, if you get out on first, right one is ~100m further). There's some forest if you want to sleep, but not a lot of lights for after sunlight. You can also go further to stop ''Wygoda'' and try on road or gas station there.\n\n\n=== Southwest towards [[Wrocław]] {{National Road Number Poland|8}} {{E|67}}, [[Łódź]] {{National Road Number Poland|72}}, [[Katowice]] {{National Road Number Poland|1}} {{E|75}} ===\n====Option 1====\n{{Coords|52.1312|20.8882}}<br>\nGet tram 7, 9, 35 from the city centre e.g ''Aleje Jerozolimskie'', ''Warszawa Centralna'' (Main Train Station), ''Centrum'' (Warsaw Metro station) going in the direction of ''P+R Aleja Krakowska'' and get off at the last stop.

All cars that go west fit you, you just need to ask driver to drop you off at that exit so that you can go {{National Road Number Poland|5}} .\n\n==== Option 2 (via [[Kłodzko]]): Magnice village {{National Road Number Poland|8}} {{E|67}} ====\nTake the bus to the village Magnice. There is direct bus number 862 from main train station (Dworzec PKP (Sucha)) and it costs 4,50 zloty but it goes not so often (once per hour) so it is better to check timetable in advance [https://www.marcopolo.pl/transport-miejski-kobierzyce timetables]. Hitchhike on the bus stop that you get off at. This spot is straight after the roundabout, so cars go slowly. All the traffic from A8 motorway towards Kudowa-Zdroj (PL / CZ) border crossing goes through this point. \n\nUse [https://jakdojade.pl/wroclaw/trasa/ website] to find bus connection with Magnice.\n\n862 - direct bus from main train station\n\nAnother option is train to Kobierzyce.

Start hitchhiking on Wroclawska street for example at "Bielany Wr. - MAKRO" bus station.\nFor this option taking train from Wroclaw main station to "Bielany Wroclawskie" could be convenient.\n\n==== Warning for option 2 and 3 ====\nIn case of getting a lift which will be crossing going by any other place than Kudowa Zdroj, \'\'\'do not\'\'\' take it (only if you can drive directly to Prague or Hradec Kralove). All other roads (as Miedzylesie - Mladkovske sedlo) are pretty dead and you might find it very difficult to get a lift in there.\n\n== Hitching in ==\n\nThere are a few different highways that circle around Wroclaw. If your driver isn\'t travelling directly to Wroclaw, it is unlikely that they will take you to the centre because it is a rather large diversion for them. \n\nIf you\'re coming either from Kraków or from Germany along the A4 motorway ask your driver to drop you off at Bielany Orlen petrol station. From there you can take a bus 612 to Wrocław main railway station. The last bus leaves at 22.14 Monday till Sunday and the bus stop is located on Wrocławska Street south of the motorway, next to Hotel Bielany.\n\nIf you\'re going along the A8, ask the driver to let you out at the airport.

Savski most a bus terminal where you can catch buses #111 or #132. These buses pass by the pay tolls "Lučko". Get off after 15 minutes of ride at bus stop  Put Za Leskovac . You can recognise a big restaurant "Calypso". Once you get off you will see that one road goes over the bridge - take the other road that doesn\'t go over the bridge, take first left and go through the parking lot and voila! you\'re there. \n\nAlso if you walk a bit highway forward you get on the Crodux petrol station. There is less traffic than on tolls.\n\nIf you are going to \'\'Dalmatia\'\' (Zadar, Split, etc.) don\'t take rides to Rijeka because it is a bit out of your way. Car plates for each city: Pula and Istria (PU), Rijeka (RI) Zadar (ZD) Šibenik (ŠI) Split (ST).\n\n*\'\' I followed the instructions about the bus to go to the Lucko toll station. The bus driver was very frıendly and explained me where to get off. From the busstop towards the toll station is 10 minutes walk. I first tried at the toll station for one hour with no luck. Then I changed strategy and I walked towards the first petrol station behind the toll station. Here you can find more shade facilities and cleaner air. Also you are able to talk to drivers. Most of the cars where tourısts with no space left. It took me 3 hours to fınd a direct ride to Split. But it was worth it. Although there is less traffic at the petrol station I believe it is a better option than the toll station. Good Luck. May 2012. Len \'\'\n\n*" I\'m always lucky with this spot, no matter where I am heading. I wait about 5-10 minutes when going to Rijeka and about 20-30 when going to Zadar, Šibenik or Split. But then again, I\'m a girl. HAVE A SIGN with car plates of the city you\'re going to. December 2012, Nina_Unexia "\n\n*" July 2015: spot worked well. There\'s a lot of police around, but they seemed not to care at all. Be careful of getting dropped on one of the rest areas though, there are quite many so traffic isn\'t very heavy on each one, and in the summertime almost all traffic is fully loaded vacation cars heading for the coast. The best rest stop before the highway split at Bosiljevo is probably Draganic, as it has both a Burger King and a Marche Bistro. We were stuck at Vukova Gorica rest area for hours."\n\n*" Even though the ticket inspectors are more common now and the bus drivers control if you have the ticket, these buses (#111 and #132) are almost always crowded so you can still sneak in without buying a ticket. April 2014, Nina_Unexia "\n\n*" You can skip the bus part - just exit the tram (14 or 7) on "Jadranska avenija" which is the name of the street in which you will get after crossing the bridge and following a small road going east (with some bigger shops on your right), you can hitch on the spot where the small street is flowing into the big one, the cars go fast but there is space - even a truck. If they\'re not going your way, just ask to be dropped at the pay toll. Great place for finding long rides. --[[User:Uyku.tulumu|Uyku.tulumu]] ([[User talk:Uyku.tulumu|talk]]) 18:38, 15 March 2013 (CET) "\n\nFurther to the above directions, you\'ll stay on tram 14 until it\'s crossed the river, then find yourself on the lower level of a motorway roundabout junction.  You have several possible exits under bridges.  When you get off the tram with the river to your back, go right.  You\'ll see a Billa supermarket and a McD\'s.  There is a slip road there with a decent dirt layby where cars can pull in.  Have a sign that reads \'LUCKO\' and you\'ll easily get a lift to the toll station five minutes up the road.  From there it\'s easy pickings.  --[[User:Looking for Stu|Looking for Stu]] ([[User talk:Looking for Stu|talk]]) 10:42, 14 May 2013 (CEST)\n\n*" July 2017 : I were in this spot and i have some advices . Really really really avoid WEEKENDS ! I were there a saturday and the jam were incredible with cars and vans full of people and staffs from many europenas countries heading to croitian costs. I didn\'t found a problem for the stop of the bus because we were 10 or 12 people( all locals except me) heading to split and other destinations. I waited maybe 2 or 3 hours in a very hot day , so i went to the petrol station 200 metres from the poll station to refresh , and some local news catch me for interview xD . My ride was fun because both of us spoke about sports and football ;)) . he was nice and ride me to Zadar poll station, so i took another stop from there to the bus station (10 minutes) . Good luck and from my personal opinion ovoid weekend guys !\n\n=== Direction [[Osijek, Slavonski Brod]], [[Belgrade]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] ===\n__TOC__\nTHEY MOVED TOLL STATION 8KM TOWARDS EAST, so going to Dumovec is no longer a good option. Get on a bus #216 or #276 from Kvaternikov trg and get off at a stop called \'\'Ivanjorečka pošta\'\' (post office in Ivanja Reka), cross the street and follow the road going on the right, it\'s called \'\'Rimski put\'\', it will take you straight to Tifon petrol station. There you can ask drivers to take you to the toll station (in croatian: naplatne kućice) or hitch on the road.\n\n\'\'\'THE BEST OPTION\'\' to Serbia and Hungary\'\nI was hitchhiking around 10 times from this spot and always got a ride within a minute or two. Take a bus 216 or 276 from Kvaternikov trg to Ivanja reka. After about 25 minutes of ride, you should see a small church on your right side ({{Coords|45.7983221|16.1181564}}). Get off the bus, walk back to the church and turn right. This street is going directly to the entrance of the highway. You have to walk around 5 minutes and you will see an intersection with a traffic light ({{Coords|45.8027577|16.1188897}}). Ask drivers at traffic light to take you to the toll gate Ivanja Reka which is now farther than it used to be before, but don\'t worry. Same HH spot if you are going north towards Budapest, just ask people if they are going to the north toll gate. (by [[User:NixyJungle|NixyJungle]])\n\nYou have three options for these destinations. \n* First option is outdated and deleted. Look up for updated version.\n* Second option is to get the tram #2, #3 or #13 to \'\'Savišće\'\' or \'\'Žitnjak\'\'. Get out at the last stop and then walk for about 15 minutes towards the motorway. On the motorway you\'ll find a bus stop and there you can easily hitchhike towards the on-ramp in \'\'Ivanja Reka\'\' or you can even stop cars who are going to Belgrade or Bosnia. Ask the locals for extra tips and explanations.\n: \n- [[User:Chillion|Chillion]] (2018) This method is good. About 5-10mins before the bus stops (there are two on the same Street), is a church where you can fill up your water bottles at the tap inside the church yard. When I hitched from the bus stop I had both "Slavonska Brod"  and "Ivanja Reka" signs. After using both, the latter sign got me a ride in 5 mins, taking me to the town of Ivanja, where I was dropped off on the highway in the direction of Serbia. Got to Serbia that same day (1 car and 2 truck rides).\n\n\'\'[[User:nuclearphyllis|Nuclearphyllis]]\' local experts took him to the first toll station on the Zagreb-Belgrade motorway, even though it was illegal to hitchhike from there. They weren\'t troubled and got a ride within 10 minutes.\'\'\n* Third option, go to Savski most and get on IKEA bus. It will take you to IKEA, and this is right on the highway to Belgrade, next to Dumovec. This bus ticket costs 10 kuna and you can use 5 kuna discount in IKEA for food or coffee. \nBus leaves Savski most station at Mon-Sat: 9:00, 10:00, 12:00, 14:00, 16:00, 18:00\nSun: 9:00, 10:00, 12:00, 14:00, 16:00\nHere are the stops:\nhttp://www.ikea.com/ms/hr_HR/about_store/ikea_bus.html?icid=hr%7Citl%7Chpl%7Ctxt_link_bus_line\n\n*I hitched 3 times in direction of Belgrade, so just one tip - if the car that is giving you a ride goes to Slavonski Brod (half way before Belgrade) ask him to drop you off at EAST EXIT of the city. in Croatian - ISTOČNI IZLAZ. because, if he drops you off at west exit, 95% of cars go to direction of Zagreb, I waited there 2 hours once, and the second time 3 hours ;)\n\nI could just add if you need to go from Zagreb to Osijek on high way A3 and a lot of cars are driving forward to Slavonski Brod Belgrade. You need to go out on turn to Đakovo and Osijek(high way A5). Than you walk right to high way and just climb up till turning for Osijek direction and hitchhike there at the beginning, cars need to slow down when they join to high way that leads to Osijek. If driver left you after Đakovo on some rest place near high way, try not to stuck up or avoid that.  Because on this high way in one hour maybe 15 cars passed by, so it is not so crowded with cars even that is main high way, try to catch ride directly to Osijek. People probably do not use often this high way becaue you must pay fee for driving there and normal road is free.\n\n=== Direction [[Budapest]], [[Varazdin]] and [[Cakovec]] ===\n(Read below, this one doesn\'t exist anymore! The best option is on the bottom - to HH on Slavonska avenija ) Take bus number 216 from Kvaternikov trg to the last stop in Ivanja Reka or bus 276 till 2 stations before the final station. Ask for the church in Ivanja Reka, people will know it, you should get out there. There will be a small road which leads to the on ramp, ask people for which one it is. You should walk till the traffic lights, the turn right and you already see the place. After the lights you should walk about 300 meters and you can start hitching there with a sign VZ for example. Works like a charm, someone waited there for less than 10 minutes.<br />\n[[User:NixyJungle|NixyJungle]] edit: No need to walk 300 meters after traffic lights. You can ask people on the traffic light. It\'s easier and more safe, plus, if the police comes, you are legal, because sign for the beginning of the highway and forbidden hitchhiking is 200 meters after the traffic light.\n\n\'\'\'Update\'\'\': This place doesn\'t exist anymore, as the new road was built and there\'s no stopping lane, so cars can\'t stop to pick you up. Don\'t hitchhike here.\n\n\'\'\'Update - april 2012\'\'\': There is able to hitchhike there, last year I was there, but it is \'\'\'very hard to get out of there\'\'\'. You need reach \'\'petrol station\'\' and the exit from station has got long shoulder where U can safely try to cach someone.\n\nThree problems:\n#90% of cars which stop are those which leave the station.\n#From those who stops almost everyone was local people.\n#It was my one of the longest stops (no less than 3 houers).\n\n\'\'\'Update\'\'\': The main problem with direction towards Hungary is that pay tolls are quite far away from Zagreb, so it would be easier if you first get to the pay tolls. The best starting point is the "Tifon" petrol station as it\'s the furthest hitchhiking spot on the way to Varaždin and Budapest you can get to by public transportation (directions to there are already described in the directions to Belgrade section on the top of this topic - bus 216 or 176 from Kvaternikov trg...) and hold a sign "ZELINA" (the closest town to the pay tolls) or "SV. HELENA" (the exact name of that pay tolls). Many drivers get off the highway just before the pay tolls, so maybe you\'ll have to walk a few kilometers. But once you\'re there, you can easily get a ride straight to Budapest.\n\nSecond option is to hitchhike on Slavonska avenija, this way you dont have to take any public transportation. You can stand after the crossroad of Slavonska avenija and Ulica Josipa Marohnića. Many people go towards the highway on this road. We hitchhiked with the sign "Sesvete", got a ride in 15 mins and got dropped at the petrol station right in front of highway ramps in Ivanja Reka. From here we hitchhiked with sign "Varazdin" and got a ride in 15-20 mins and got dropped at the pay tolls towards north.\n\nNote: this (the crossing of Slavonska avenija and Ul. Ulica Josipa Marohnića) seems to be the best and easiest option. Many cars in the direction, there\'re traffic lights + lot of space for cars to stop. From the central square (Trg bana Josipa Jelačića) you can either walk (southwards, 3km) or take trams 14 (direction ZAPRUĐE) or 17 (direction BORONGAJ)  for 15mins till the stop Vjesnik. The stop is near the crossing of Savska cesta and Slavonska avenija, so you have to walk 10min till the spot where Ul. Ulica Josipa Marohnića is. You can hold sign VŽ (Varaždin). Once you get a ride and are on the highway, be sure to get off at the first petrol station (OMV, some 20kms from the starting point), because it\'s also the last one before Varaždin!\n\n[[User:Gallar|Gallar]] hitch-hiked (with girlfriend) from crossroad of Slavonska avenija and Ulica Josipa Marohnića and he waited 9 hours just for a single lift to mentioned OMV station. It might be bad luck, but be aware there is no better place to hike and yet this one might be not so perfect.\n\nNote: This can\'t be a good hitchhiking spot by any reason as it\'s too much inside the town and there\'s too much of local traffic, also there are more cars coming to Zagreb from the west than those departing to the east. However, it\'s not impossible, but getting a lift there in a normal time is more about the luck...\n\nUpdate: I think the best spot to hitchhike from is the gas station on Slavonska avenija 110, you can get there by taking 286 bus and walking for like 15 mins, even though it\'s like 40 mins from the city centre but there is plenty of room to stop, also I dont recommend going to Varazdin and hoping to get a ride at the toll booth going to the highway because the traffic is pretty small there and mainly not towards budapest. There is a gas station before Varazdin(like 10 km) and we got a ride from there in like 5 mins.\n\nJune 2019\n\nAnother good option is to take the tram until Dubec.  At least 3 different lines end there.  Once you get there look for a bus going to Sesvete.  There will most likely be many people trying to board and you should be able to enter from any door.  The ride shouldn’t take more then 10 minutes and you will find it makes a left turn followed by two right turns soon after.  This is where you want to get off and cross the street. (Veraždinska cesta; bus stop Selčina) The bus stop on this side is slightly further up the road. You will then want bus 273 going to Lužan. (Someone entered this bus from the middle door as well.)  Take bus 273 to the end of the line.  From here it is just a 3.2 kilometer walk to the first gas station directly on the highway.  There is a gravel road after you cross over the highway which you can easily reach by going a couple hundred meters past the highway.  (No need to try and cross the ditch to reach it.) As you approach the gas station fence and the road turns to lead around the back you will see a gap where you can easily hop the fence and follow a well formed path directly to the parking lot.  It should be just a handful of meters after the curve and very easy to notice.\n\nThere are also plenty of good places where one can pitch a tent for the night if one wants to come out here in the evening and get a nice and early start the following morning.\n\n=== Direction [[Ljubljana]], [[Austria]], [[Novo Mesto]] ===\n\'\'\'From town\'\'\'\n\nTake tram #5 or #17 from the centre of Zagreb towards the \'\'Precko\'\'. Notice that the ride takes a lot of time, 45 minutes at least. In \'\'Precko\'\', exit the tram and walk left. You\'ll see a street that turns right. Take this street and walk 5 minutes till you get to the main street \'\'Ljubljanska Avenija\'\' (also called \'\'Zagrebacka Avenija\'\'). Cross this street in front of the \'\'Konzum\'\' supermarket and turn left. You will see a small bus station, this is your spot. However most people commute from this point. Best is to hitchhike from there with a SLO sign. Don\'t take rides that don\'t take you at least to the border - There is no good places to hitchhike further down the road. From the border crossing itself it\'s relatively easy to get a good ride, even as far as to Austria.\n\nOn a [[Good times to hitchhike|Sunday]] Erga and [[User:Guaka|guaka]] waited way to long. Not a single car stopped in two hours time, and at the petrol stations everyone with space pretended not to go anywhere near Slovenia (West or North). Two Belgian guys didn\'t manage to get a ride in the same period, also trying in different spots in the area ([[User:Guaka|guaka]] somehow convinced the West Gate bus driver to also pick them up). Use the West Gate option if you\'re simply heading to Austria, find another solution if you\'re heading towards Ljubljana...\n\nAfter more than one hour of waiting, I went further down the road to the next bus stop (in front of FORD car dealer center) where most of the local traffic is gone and I found a ride after 15min.\n\n* I recommend following this advice, after going to the Konzum market to get some food and cardboard I spent only 40 mn before someone offered to take me to Slovenia. You are highly visible and this worked at dawn.\n\n\'\'\'INA Lučko - north\'\'\'\n\nINA Lučko - north is a big rest stop just outside Zagreb, and it takes quite a long time to come there from the city center. You have to take a tram to Savski most and then bus line 112 or 168 to Lučko centar. Don\'t panic when you won\'t see any shopping center as you expect, this place looks like a village;) from there, you walk for about 2km to reach the stop.\n\nIt is good place to hitchhike and locals told me that\'s where everybody goes. For me it took whole 3.5h to get a pick (december 2019), but it was one day before christmas, so the place was deserted. I got a direct ride to Ljubljana after all, so i can recommend.\n\n\'\'\'Take a bus to the highway\'\'\'\n\nThis option takes you a bit longer to get started with (nearly an hour), it takes you directly to the highway though.\n\n== Much better option to Slovenia ==\nTake a bus number 112 from "Savski most" bus station. Get of the bus at the last station. You should see highway from that place. If you don\'t, ask for the direction. Above highway you will see an overpass. Go to the opposite side and hitchhike there at the entrance of the road. There is a petrol station with many cars entering the highway. If it\'s easier for you, it is a place called Motel Plitvice and it\'s here {{Coords|45.7747269|15.8804763}} (by [[User:NixyJungle|NixyJungle]])\n\nCaution: On a Sunday check the [http://www.zet.t-com.hr/media/144255/112nnn.pdf schedule for bus 112], since it does not depart very frequently that day - [[User:Questrayer|Questrayer]] had to wait for about 80 minutes. Apart from that, this option is very good, and he got a ride all the way to Ljubljana within 15 minutes approaching people at the petrol station.  \n\n=== North, direction [[Maribor]], [[Graz]], [[Vienna]] ===\n==== First option ====\nFrom the Črnomerec and Ljubljanica bus terminal there\'s a free bus (red or white colour) to West Gate shopping centre which is adjacent to toll station (check out the West Gate Zagreb page to find out its schedule), see also [http://maps.google.com/?q=zagreb&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=City+of+Zagreb,+Croatia&ll=45.874518,15.829003&spn=0.009815,0.02459&t=h&z=16 Google Maps], the toll station is very close to the shopping center, you can see it from the parking lot where the bus arrives. But you will have to cross a bit of water. Don\'t try this in the dark. Look for one of the areas with stones covered by metal or just walk about 300 metre in opposite direction of the shopping mall and you will find a little bridge, handy! then come back to the toll station.\n\nIf you\'re heading to [[Slovenia]] or further you\'ll have to make it to the [[Macelj-Kozminci border crossing]], from where you can easily get rides far into [[Germany]].\n\nYou better forget about trying the Precko option (towards Ljubljana), Erga and [[User:Guaka|guaka]] waited for about 2 hours, asking people, with signs (\'\'Macelj\'\', \'\'Maribor\'\', SLO) and without sign. Fortunately the free bus to the West Gate center also goes from this above spot.\n\n[[User:T0ma5|t0ma5]] was hitchhiking here in January 2011 and he got a ride all the way to Vienna in about 20min.\n\n[[User:Cro_gavran|Cro_gavran]] tried to hitchhike here in September 2014 but was in just few minutes forced to leave by highway guards. They said that same day they moved out from highway already 5 hitchhikers and called police to arrest two who didnt wanted to leave the highway. If someone else had same experience, please share.\n\n[[User:Uncle sam01|uncle_sam01]] hitched a direct ride to Bratislava in about 20 minutes in August 2015. Definitely wouldn\'t recommend going over the bridge, since the right side is virtually impossible to walk towards the highway (bushes, trees, water, weeds, etc.). In August 2015 there was only a relatively short fence, which was easy to climb over but you must cross the highway, which is obviously not the safest thing to do, but cars go slow and there are no barriers in the middle. No one bothered us, except some maintenance guy in a pick up who was driving by, but we couldn\'t make out what he was saying and no one from the toll booths told us anything even though they clearly saw us hitching.\n\n--[[User:Yeguaerrante|Yeguaerrante]] ([[User talk:Yeguaerrante|talk]]) 13:05, 18 November 2015 (CET) You can\'t get to the toll station, it\'s all fenced, i waited on the road after going for the blue small bridge, you will see a bridge that crosses the highway, a car pick me up after 20 min and took me to small town area, was really hard to get into the highway this way because there was a lot of locals not going too far away. \n\n--[[User:Duffajfka|Duffajfka]] walked from the shopping centre along D1 in the direction back to Zagreb until the highway ramp to the north. As it\'s a two lane one with not too dense traffic, he tried to hitchhike from the guardrail with a sign "Odmorište" (service area), probably "Naplatna Postaja" (toll booth) would be easier. As he has already been inside the fence, he walked to the toll booth. It was quite a hard walk, but probably worth it. Tried to hitch right from the gates but was expelled by the staff few tens of meters behind the booth, where a car to Graz easily stopped in 20 mins. (May 2019)\n \nAs alternative, try to get Plitvice petrol station (not to confuse with famous National park!). It is reachable from Lučko trough the village. It is around 3 km walk.\n\n==== Second option ====\n\nInstead of the seemingly risky toll station, you can also get a bus to King Cross shopping center or simply walk along Ljubljanska avenija until you reach the on-ramp of the highway. The spot is an approach road of a nearby, not very frequented truck park and offers great visibility and space to pull over for bypassing drivers. [[User:Vapaakulkuri|vapaakulkuri]] however still had to wait about two hours to get a ride to the first gas station that is located about 20km down the road.\n\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\n\n[[trash:Zagreb]] [[nomad:Zagreb]]\n\n\n[[Category:E65]]\n[[Category:E59]]\n[[Category:E71]]'},

Alternatively you can walk around 1,5 km in Northeastern direction following the streets \'\'Stationsplein\'\', \'\'Nieuwstad\'\', \'\'Dijkmeesterweg\'\' and \'\'Deventerweg\'\'. \n\nYou can hitch rides straight from the busstop.\n\nFrom here is also the best spot to get to the {{Anl|1}}, and from there to [[Amsterdam]], [[Hengelo]] or [[Germany]].\n\n=== East towards [[Lochem]], [[Hengelo]] ===\n\n====Option 1====\n{{Coords|52.145|6.233}}<br>\nTake bus \'\'\'54\'\'\' and get off at \'\'Rhienderinklaan\'\'. Hitch from the bus stop along the {{Nnl|346}} in eastern direction. Also accept offers to [[Vorden]], they might lead a bit in the wrong direction, but you can be dropped off at the roundabout where the {{Nnl|314}} and {{Nnl|319}} meet. From there you can hitch in northen direction to the next roundabout. Most of the time you\'ll already get a ride in direction Lochem from the first mentioned roundabout (option 2).\n\n====Option 2====\n{{Coords|52.134|6.259}}<br>\nTake bus \'\'\'51\'\'\' and get off at \'\'GG Net\'\'. Follow the road in the direction of the bus for around 1km and then turn right. Hitch from the roundabout where the {{Nnl|314}} and {{Nnl|319}} meet in northern direction, as also described above.\n\n=== Southwest towards [[Dieren]], [[Arnhem]] ===\n{{Coords|52.140|6.184}}<br>\nFrom the train station, walk in western direction along the \'\'Stationsplein\'\'. Cross the bridge over the river IJssel and follow this road until the crossing of the \'\'Kanonsdijk\'\' and \'\'Weg naar Voorst\'\'. There\'s a bus stop right after the crossing on the \'\'Kanonsdijk\'\'.\n\nPay attention though because there is a roundabout where the {{Nnl|348}} and {{Nnl|345}} meet. If you don\'t have a ride past [[Brummen]] you\'re going to have to get out here. The spot here is not good at all however. The roundabout is quite fast and there\'s no shoulder.\n\n=== South towards [[Doetinchem]] ===\nAfter Zutphen there are many good places to hitchhike from like parking bays, bus stops and gas stations, so even if you get a ride only to [[Baak]], accept it. You wont be there for long.\n\n====Option 1====\n{{Coords|52.1352|6.2193}}<br> \nParking bay along the {{Nnl|348}}. Either jump the ditch after coming from \'\'Piet Heinstraat\'\', or walk along the ditch from the crossing with \'\'Gerard Douwstraat\'\'.\n\n====Option 2====\n{{Coords|52.1176|6.2160}}\nBusstop \'\'Revelhorst\'\'. This one is further from the centre, but can be usefull when getting dropped of from the East or West.\n\n=== West towards [[Apeldoorn]] ===\n{{Coords|52.141|6.184}}<br>\nFollow the directions for southwest to Dieren and Arnhem, but instead hitch from the road \'\'Weg naar Voorst\'\'. There\'s a bus stop right after the crossing. Once you hit the roundabout at the small village of Gietelo, make sure to continue on the {{Nnl|345}} towards Apeldoorn. That means you\'ll have to turn left instead of going straight.\n\nIf your driver goes to the on-ramp at the {{Anl|1}} (on-ramp 21), it might be wise to leave the car at one of the two roundabouts after Gietelo. You might be able to catch a ride going into Apeldoorn then, something that will be much harder at the fast road crossing under the highway A1.\n\n== Hitching in ==\n<!---\n\'\'\'Only\'\'\' include this section if it is difficult to enter a city, like from the ring around Berlin or the M25 around London!\n-->\n\n== Places to avoid ==\n\n== Accommodation and Sleep ==\n<!---\nWild camping places are good.

It has very good road infrastructure connecting it to the north, south and west, but eastbound is lacking. \n\n== Hitchhiking out ==\nMotorway [[A28 (Netherlands)|A28]] runs right through town. It has four ramps in Zwolle, of which two are useful for hitching; '''19''' and '''20'''. Use ramp 19 (Zwolle-centrum) for both north and southbound hitchhiking; and ramp 20 (Zwolle-noord) for northbound hitchhiking. \nRamp '''21''' [[Ommen]] is inconveniently located in an industrial estate on the north side of town, but does get a fair amount of traffic from the surrounding towns, and ramp '''18''' (Zwolle-zuid) is basically just a big roundabout with no good place to stop, at least not there where the traffic isn't going at least 80 km/h. The on-ramp in the direction of Leeuwarden does have a hard shoulder, but traffic is still fast here so it might be hard to stop cars.\n\n=== North towards [[Leeuwarden]], [[Groningen]] ===\nIf you need to go towards Leeuwarden, try to get a ride at least to [[Meppel]] on the [[A32 (Netherlands)|A32]]. On the other hand, if you Groningen is your destination, try to get a ride to [[Hoogeveen]]. Otherwise, get out at the service station ''Dekkersland'' and change cars.\n\n====Option 1, onramp 19====\n{{Coords|52.5177|6.0863}}<br>\nOn-ramp '''19''' is within walking distance (~1km) of the city centre. Get to the ''Pannekoekendijk'' and walk in northern direction until the roundabout. Turn left here on the ''Burgemeester Roelenweg''. After 400m the on-ramp is on your right. It has a nice hard shoulder with plenty of space for cars to stop.\n\n====Option 2, onramp 20====\n{{Coords|52.5253|6.1173}}<br>\nOn-ramp '''20''' is just as good as '''19''', but has less traffic and is further away from the city centre.\n\n=== South towards [[Amersfoort]], [[Utrecht]] or [[Apeldoorn]], [[Arnhem]] ===\n{{Coords|52.5168|6.0818}}<br>\nWalk to on-ramp '''19''' via ''Pannekoekendijk'' and then ''Katerdijk'' in western direction. Go under the overpass and find the on-ramp on your left side. The highway splits very soon after this on-ramp, so make sure to get a ride in the good direction. The {{Anl|28}} takes you towards Amersfoort, Utrecht and [[Amsterdam]], the {{Anl|50}} to Apeldoorn and Arnhem.\n\n=== South towards [[Deventer]] ===\n====Option 1====\n{{Coords|52.5168|6.0818}}<br>\nThere are two options to get to Deventer, based on the part of the city you're in. If you're close to the city centre, follow the advise above regarding direction ''Apeldoorn'', and ask to be dropped off at exit '''26''' [[Vaassen]]. From here you can hitchhike through the countryside in eastern direction on a straightforward route to Deventer.\n\n====Option 2====\n{{Coords|52.4860|6.1272}} Roundabour<br>\n{{Coords|52.4699|6.1322}} Crossing<br>\nIf you are more in the south-east of the city, get to the roundabout on the {{Nnl|337}} just after the crossing of the ''IJsselallee'' and ''Oldeneelallee''. An alternative if you don't mind walking is getting to the crossing of the {{Nnl|337}} and the ''Hollewandsweg'' at very south-eastern part of the city.\n\n=== South-east towards [[Almelo]], [[Enschede]] and [[Germany]] ===\n{{Coords|52.5049|6.1261}}<br>\nIf you're heading to Twente or Germany, head down to one of the many bus stops on the ''Ceintuurbaan''. Bus stop ''Kuyerhuislaan'' seems to be the most suitable one because of its location (best compromise between distance from city centre and amount of local traffic), but feel free to try ''Meppelerstraatweg'' or the abandoned one next to the Isala hospital if you don't feel like walking that far or ''De Marslanden'' if you want to filter out local traffic. A shared trait of all of the above spots is that the cars might be going too fast to stop for you, but, with a little bit of luck, you should be able to get a ride to the south-east within no time.\n\n== Sleeping ==\nSouth of the city centre is a park called ''Het Engelse Werk'' / ''Spoolderbos''. There are some quiet places here where you can pitch a tent. To get there follow the ''Nieuwe Veerallee'' and cross under the {{Nnl|337}} through the pedestrian/cyclist tunnel.\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n----\n<!--Infoboxes and categories.

 'Zywiec': {'text': "'''Żywiec''' is a town in [[Poland]]. If you find yourself wandering in surrounding ''Beskidy'' mountains, you are likely to pay a visit sooner or later. Some people might have tried beer produced here, which is named after the town.\n\nPronunciation might be a little tricky - the first sign '''ż''' is pronounced as ''s'' in ''pleasure'', then '''y''' like ''i'' in ''lip'', '''w''' stands for v, '''i''' pronounced as in ''big'', '''e''' like in ''bed'' and finally '''c''' like ''ts'' in ''bits''. Good luck.\n\n== Hitchhiking out ==\n=== North towards [[Bielsko-Biała]], [[Katowice]] and south towards [[Slovakia]] by {{National Road Number Poland|S1}} ===\n==== Spot nr 1 ====\n{{Coords|49.6886|19.1755}}\n\nFrom the main railway station ''' 'Żywiec' ''' (there are few) go through a foot-bridge above the tracks and turn right into ''Armii Krajowej'' street. You will soon get to a roundabout next to a McDonalds restaurant. You may ask for a piece of box for a sign. Walk down ''Podlesie'' street which begins behind the restaurant and after a few steps turn left into ''Sezamowa''. Walk along the fence and find an opening which allow people to cross the main road, there is a pedestrian crossing and a little space for cars to stop. Make a visible sign so they see you from the distance\n\n'''This spot will probably not work during the night'''. When it's dark there is a better idea - hitchhike just past the roundabout, next to McDonalds. There is little traffic, drivers slow down before the roundabout and even if they won't stop right next to you (they are not allowed) they have the option of turning right for McDolands parking and then calling you.\n\n==== Spot nr 2 ====\nPetrol station next to the roundabout described above. Safer option if you feel insecure about spot nr 1, where people might be going pretty fast.\n\n=== South-east towards [[Jeleśnia]], [[Korbielów]] and [[Dolny Kubin]], [[Slovakia]] by 945 ===\n{{Coords|49.6819|19.2018}}\n\nIf you are going to hike ''Pilsko'' or ''Babia Góra'', that is the way to go.\n\nFrom the main railway station ''' 'Żywiec' ''' go down Dworcowa street to the north. Right after you cross the bridge turn right and follow the road. You'll get to a parking which provides quite a lot of space to hitchhike.\n\n\n== Accommodation and Sleep ==\nYou might wildcamp at the ''Soła'' river bank. Follow instructions for hitchhiking out towards Jeleśnia written above. Instead of looking for the parking find the yellow trail (coordinates: 49.6820428N, 19.2015203E) and turn right into it. After crossing the bridge you may start looking for a good place to put your tent up.\n\nTrain (described below) to '''Rajcza''' (direction '''Zwardoń''') costs few zlotys and takes you into the mountains. Of course you can hitchhike there as well - follow instructions for Zwardoń described above. Feels way more wild than Żywiec. Provided weather is favourable and you are up for hiking a little: go to ''Ujsolska'' street which begins right next to the railway station in Rajcza, hitchhike few kilometers to '''Ujsoły''' and hike the green trail to the top of ''Muńcuł'' mountain - put your tent up on the meadow and enjoy fabulous views, especially if you wake early enough to catch the sunrise.\n\n== Other useful info ==\nStreet lights are turned off from 00:00 to 04:30am (20.02.2021)\n\nRail transport works well. Most trains are operated by ''Koleje Śląskie'' and head either north to '''Katowice''' or south to '''Zwardoń'''. Katowice is the capital of the region, where a night in a hostel can be as cheap as 20PLN (5 EUR). The route to the south goes through the mountains all the way to the Slovakian border, where it is possible to cross the border by foot and take a train at Slovakian side. The last train towards Katowice departs more less at 10pm. Buy a ticket at the railway station, if for any reason you don't have a valid one use the first door to board the train and wait for the manager.\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n{{IsIn|Poland}}\n{{Category|Poland}}\n{{Category|City's}}"},

It is the biggest city in Switzerland, but not its capital. The city is well connected with motorways in all directions. Keep in mind that Zürich (and Switzerland in general) is expensive compared to its neighbouring countries.     \n\n\n== Hitchhiking out ==\n\n\n=== Northwest towards [[Basel]] {{European Route Number|60}}, southwest towards [[Bern]] {{European Route Number|35}}, ===\n\n\n\'\'\'Option 1 \'\'\'\n\nTake tram 4 to \'\'Sportweg\'\'. Cross the tram tracks to the opposite platform and walk back about 30m in the direction the tram came to the lay-by on Pfingstweidstrasse. This is a very good hitching spot located before the motorway entrance as cars are not going too fast and drivers can see you from afar and have time to pull into the lay-by. It is also a spot easily accessible from the city center.  \n\n\'\'\'Option 2 \'\'\'\n\nAnother option is to reach a petrol station on the motorway by train and then foot. Take the S12 to \'\'Kilwangen-Spreitenbach\'\'. The stop is near the service station. One can also use this petrol station to go east and south of \'\'\'Zürich\'\'\' by using the opposite side to the Bern/Basel exit.\n\n\'\'\'Option 3\'\'\'\n\nThird option is to reach an other petrol station on the motorway by train and then foot.Take the S6 (Direction Baden) and stop at Würenlos or go to the train station Killwangen Spreitenbach (there are both at the same distance more or less). From there you will have to walk to the gas station (C8QX+F3 Würenlos, Suisse)  crossing the village and then follow a road leading the station itself (crossing nice fields and a little forest from Würenlos). There is a gate which opens in both direction that gives you access to this big gas station and you can access both sides of the motorway since the stations are connected. Easy rides towards to Lausanne/Geneve and even France.\n\n=== South towards [[Italy]] {{European Route Number|41}}, east towards [[Austria]] ===\n\nFollow signs in the city for motorway 4 to [[Luzern]]. You will reach West st. Just past the intersection of West and Werd, there is a driveway in front of an apartment building where cars can pull over just before the right turn onto the onramp of motorway 4. To get to the onramp of the motorway from Bahnhof Wiedikon (a railway station nearby) take a look at \'\'this map\'\' {{Coords|47.3702897|8.522488|1}}. It is also possible to walk from the city center, it should take you about 15-20 min.\n\n\nThis spot is also an option if you are heading for the canton of Graubünden, Austria, Liechtenstein, and southern Germany, especially Munich (via Bregenz).\n\nSince there is the bypass tunnel, you can also stay at the spot at Pfingstweidstrasse (look above) to go towards Luzern and Italy. There are not so many cars going in this direction, but it is a very kindly spot.\n\n\nUpdate nov 2024: \nThis spot is outside a fire station and is illegal to stop there, I would not say this is a good spot. If you want to hitch this road there is another spot just down the road right before the road splits and where the big signs are.\n\nIn my experience this spot is not very good, a lot off traffic but nobody stopped for me, and many are probably not going far. I think a way better way of getting out of Zürich is to take the bus to Affoltern where you can go to the gas station and raststätte right by the highway.\n\n=== North towards [[Germany]], east towards [[Austria]], [[Germany]] ===\n\n\n\'\'\'Option 1\'\'\' from city centre\n\nTo start towards Germany from the City Centre you can also take the public transport to Limmatplatz and walk over the Kornhausbrücke. On the other side of the bridge you take the stairs down to the Wasserwerkstrasse. Just some hundred meters from there the highway starts into a tunnel to the left. You can walk near the tunnel and take position in the middle of the street on the traffic island just in front of the traffic light. Like that the cars can see you easily and you can jump in, while it is red. Unfortunately, this position is not very comfortable because you are standing in the middle of the traffic (an I am not sure, if it is legal... but normally you come away quite fast). If you don`t like that (or if it is raining) you can also stay under the Kornhausbrücke. There is not so much traffic, but it is also ok. The best thing is to write Winterthur on your board. Like that you are coming to the petrol station Kempttal just in front of Winterthur.\n\n\'\'\'Option 2\'\'\' BP petrol station\n\nTake S-Bahn S7 to Kemptthal (~25 minutes from the main station), then walk up the hill in the direction from where the train came from. After a 5 min walk, you should see a grassy hill on your right hand side. Walk to the top of the grassy hill and you will find a BP petrol station, a restaurant and a small COOP supermarket.\n\n\n== Public Transport (Freeriding) ==\n\nOn the buses after 21.00 (when the controllers stop their work day) one has to enter at the front and show the driver their ticket, before then, one should be really careful because the conductors can come with a whole bunch of people and won\'t let anyone out. Better to take the tram - according to a friend who grew up in Zurich the chance is very small that there will be a control, and after 21 there won\'t be any controllers at all. \n\nHowever, if taking the tram during the day, and there is a control, you are going to be caught. They come in a giant group of ~15 and take up the entire station so you can\'t escape. I was caught 8/2015 and plead poverty, although while I had my wallet out giving ID, he discovered I had euros (40), so he took that, saying I owed the remaining 60 and gave me a receipt/bill/ticket.\n\nYou can also reach everything in Zürich very easy by bike. Here you can rent bikes for free (you have to give a deposit): https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/aoz/de/index/shop/veloverleih.html\n\n\n== Free Food / Free Concerts ==\n\nEvery Saturday you can go to a Bar called "La Stanza" in Bleicherweg 10 from 18:00 to 19:00, they will serve free pasta as long as they have some.\nThis is a Homepage where a guy is collecting all the free concerts and interesting free stuff in Zürich: www.zuerifreikollekte.tk\nThere is also www.zuerichunbezahlbar for a broader spectrum of free events like museum entries etc.\n\n\n== Wild camping ==\n\nIn the Platzpromenade, there is a big tree big enough to set the tent inside, well hiden inside.\n\n\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\n\n{{nomadwiki}}\n\n\n\n\n{{Template:Cities Switzerland}}\n\n[[Category:Switzerland]]\n[[Category:E60]]\n[[Category:E41]]\n\n[[de:Zürich]]\n[[tr:Zürih]]'},

The good thing, this far north the swedish people are more open to pick up hitchhikers.\n\n===West on the [[E14]] towards [[Åre]] and [[Norway]]===\n\nTake public transport to the village [[Brunflo]], 10 km north of Östersund. {??Brunflo is south-east of Östersund??} There is a gas station in the end of the village, also the cars drive very slow on this road. You can also walk out to Trondheimsvägen (called Rådhusgatan before leaving Östersund). There\'s a bus stop where students from Åre usually hitchhike from.\n\nAlthough a bit outside, Krokom is a good place to hitchhike from. There\'s a roundabout on the E14 and a gas station next to it. Krokom is 20km northwest of Östersund. To get there you could either try hitchhiking (write Krokom on your sign) or take the bus.\n\n===South on the [[E45]] towards [[Mora]]===\n\n====Option 1====\n{{Coords|63.1715|14.7029}}<br>\nYou can walk to Lillänge. After a big roundabout there\'s McDonal\'s, a gas station and grocery stores. But the problem is, that this part of the road is not a normal one. It is not a highway, but you are not allowed to walk on it. So what you can do is to walk further to a kind of parking lot. \nYou cannot walk beside the road, so you have to get there through some nature trails. I is good to have a map or gps not to get lost. Where the nature trail makes a curve you can climb up to the spot. There you can stand in a save distance to the street and the cars see you from a far.\n"Stefansupertramp got a ride there after 30 min"\n\n====Option 2====\nYou take a bus or train to Brunflo and search for a spot after the roundabout where the E14 and E45 split.\n\n[[trash:Östersund]]\n\n{{IsIn|Jämtlands län}}\n{{Category|Sweden}}\n{{Category|City\'s}}\n{{Category|E14}}\n{{Category|E45}}'}}
