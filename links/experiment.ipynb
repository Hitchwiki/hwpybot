License plates with \\'\\'\\'DN\\'\\'\\' indicate that a car is from the neighbour locality of Düren in the east. The central terminal for local and regional buses is called \\'\\'Aachen Bushof\\'\\'.\\n\\nLocal inhabitants tell that during recent months there were some car robberies (summer 2014), when one person stops the car and suddenly other people appear and take the car from the person. It was said to be some immigrants from Belgium. So car drivers are very circumspect and it is harder to get a lift there.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n=== East to Cologne {{Autobahn|4}}, north to Düsseldorf {{Autobahn|44}} ===\\n\\nThe \\'\\'Europaplatz\\'\\' roundabout is a popular hitchhiker spot to start to any destination within Germany. It is located in the east of Aachen directly near the on-ramp and can be reached quickly. There is an Esso petrol station where you can ask and that also offers a spot where cars can see you easily and stop. If you don\\'t feel lucky at the Esso there is also an ARAL petrol station at the same roundabout. Cars could also stop for you at the hard shoulder right after the roundabout, but the spot is already on the autobahn so police might ask you to leave.\\n\\nGetting there is a 15 minute walk from \\'\\'Aachen Bushof\\'\\'. Go east for the \\'\\'Peterstraße\\'\\' which later becomes the \\'\\'Jülicher Straße\\'\\'. At the \\'\\'Blücherplatz\\'\\' square you will see a church to your right. Bear right following the B1 federal road and you will come to the Esso petrol station.\\n\\n=== West towards [[Maastricht]] ===\\n\\nIt is possible to get to Maastricht via the autobahn A4 (A76 in Netherlands) or the federal road B1 (N278 in Netherlands). To take the autobahn, walk from the \\'\\'Ponttor\\'\\' while in Aachen for about two kilometers up the \\'\\'Roermonderstrasse\\'\\' or take the buses 27, 37, 47 or 77 from the central bus station \\'\\'Aachen Bushof\\'\\' to \\'\\'Jupp-Müller-Straße\\'\\'. There are two petrol stations and the bus stop for thumbing where you can find a Dutch driver. If he\\'s not passing by Maastricht you can get out at the A76 exit #2 \\'\\'Geleen\\'\\' or N281 exit \\'\\'Maastricht\\'\\' and continue from there.\\n\\nPeople going from Aachen to Maastricht might prefer to use the federal road via Vaals, the first town after the Netherlands border, instead of the autobahn. To get there, go to the B1 \\'\\'Vaalserstrasse\\'\\' or take a bus to \\'\\'Vaals\\'\\'. When in Vaals, walk to the roundabout on \\'\\'Maastricherlaan\\'\\' road, go for 20 meters more and you will see a bus stop where cars going to Maastricht can stop.\\n\\n=== West towards [[Netherlands]] {{Autobahn|4}} {{E|314}}, [[Belgium]] {{Autobahn|44}} {{E|40}}, East towards [[Cologne|Köln]] {{Autobahn|4}} via service station \\'\\'Aachener Land\\'\\' ===\\n<map lat=\\'50.80\\' lng=\\'6.1571502685546875\\' zoom=\\'12\\' view=\\'0\\' width=\\'400\\' height=\\'220\\' float=\\'right\\'/>\\nThe autobahn [[petrol station hitchhiking|service station]] \\'\\'Aachener Land\\'\\' is located 10 km east of Aachen on the A4. The north side is good for heading towards Netherlands or Belgium, while the south side offers good opportunities to hitch towards almost any region in [[Germany]] via [[Cologne|Köln]].\\n\\nYou can either hitchhike there or take the bus. Hitchhike from \\'\\'Europaplatz\\'\\' roundabout as explained in going east. To go further east towards Germany, stay on this side; cross the autobahn to continue towards Belgium or Netherlands.\\n\\nBus line 52 from \\'\\'Aachen Bushof\\'\\' in direction of \\'\\'Eschweiler Bushof\\'\\' will take you to the station \\'\\'Röhe Wasserwerk\\'\\' in about 25 minutes. (3,20 Euro in January 2012). To continue in direction of [[Cologne|Köln]] just walk back 500 meters, to go to the Netherlands or Belgium cross the bridge over the autobahn and turn left at the first street.\\n[[File:AachenerLand2013.jpeg|200px|thumb|left|Approaching Aachener Land from town Eschweiler]]\\n\\n=== West towards [[Liège]] (B), south towards [[Luxembourg]] {{Autobahn|44}} {{E|40}}===\\nTo go to in the direction of Belgium, especially if you want to go to [[Liège]] or [[Luxembourg]], go to the service station \\'\\'Lichtenbusch\\'\\' on the German-Belgium border at the A44. There\\'s not too much traffic, and most of it seems to go via [[Liege]] and [[Namur]] to France.\\n\\n==== Option 1 ====\\nTake bus 11, 36, 55 or SB63 from the centre to \\'\\'Kohlhof\\'\\'. Walk westwards on the little street parallel to the motorway and you will find the service area on the right. There\\'s a pedestrian bridge connecting both sides.\\n\\n==== Option 2 ====\\nTo get to the service station or the exit you can also hitchhike from the bus station \\'\\'Aachen Siegel\\'\\'. It can be reached by bus lines #11, #21, #36, #46, #53 and #SB63 or by a 45 minute walk from the city centre to the south. Cars can easily see you and stop.\\n\\n==== Option 3 ====\\nOne may also thumb at the on-ramp at the Autobahn exit \\'\\'Aachen Brand\\'\\' on the A44. To get there take bus lines 25, 45, 55 or 68 from the main bus station \\'\\'Aachen Bushof\\'\\' until \\'\\'Königsberger Straße\\'\\' (2,55 Euro as of May 2013). Walk 500 m along the road and either thumb down the cars coming from Aachen centre turning right or the cars going straight onto the highway from the industrial area. Beware that there is local traffic that will leave the Autobahn on the next exit.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Eifel]] region ===\\n\\nTo get into the region south of Aachen hitchhike from the bus station \\'\\'Aachen Siegel\\'\\'. It can be reached by bus lines #11, #21, #36, #46, #53 and #SB63 or by a 45 minute walk from the city centre to the south. The spot is perfect if you want to hitchhike south to the Eifel in the direction of Roetgen, Monschau, Simmerath or further. Cars can easily see you and stop.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking In ==\\n\\nIf you are with people that are going directly to Aachen being dropped of at the central bus terminal \\'\\'Aachen Bushof\\'\\' is a good idea. Most buses come through there, but this is not the main train station. Otherwise, if your driver is only passing by the city your best option to get off depends on the direction.\\n\\n=== A4 from/to west (Netherlands) ===\\n\\nAsk your driver to drop you off at the exit #3 \\'\\'Aachen Zentrum\\'\\'. From there you can take various buses to the central bus terminal \\'\\'Aachen Bushof\\'\\'. If you\\'re coming from the Netherlands, your driver can turn around when going straight after the exit. Otherwise, going towards the Netherlands he should turn right and then left to be able to drop you off and make a U-turn.\\n\\nDon\\'t drop yourself at the Dutch petrol station (Shell) near borderpoint Vetschau. It was very difficult to find a ride just to Aachen and I stucked there for 3 hours in Feb 2018. There is also NO train-station in the next village Bochholtz (like in some maps), but at least some bus-services to Aachen.\\n\\n=== A4 from/to east (Cologne) ===\\n\\nWhen your driver is passing by on the A4 it is a good idea to get out at the autobahn service station \\'\\'Aachener Land\\'\\' and take the bus 52 to the center (see [[Aachen#Hitchhiking Out|Hitchhiking Out]]). Buses to Aachen go weekdays every half hour between 5:00 and 20:30 and hourly until 23:30. Saturday service is from 5:30 until 23:30 and sunday service is between 8:30 and 23:30.\\n\\n=== A44 from/to south (Belgium) ===\\n\\nOn the A44 from/to Belgium, get dropped off at the exit #3 \\'\\'Aachen Brand\\'\\'. You can use the frequent bus service at any time from there to the center (2,40 Euro as of January 2012) or try to hitchhike. Your driver can get back on the highway easily.\\n\\n== Public transportation ==\\n\\nCheck [http://www.aseag.de/ the website of the local bus operator ASEAG] for bus informations. There is no english page but you can just input your request on the top right. Input the start city (e.g. \\'\\'Aachen\\'\\') and station (e.g. \\'\\'Bushof\\'\\', the main bus terminal) and the same for the destination in the second row. The results are understandable without knowing German.\\n\\nPeople with monthly tickets and job tickets can take you along for free in buses and regional RE trains on weekdays from 19:00 until 3:00 and on the whole weekend within the area of their validity. Feel free to ask around.\\n\\n== Other useful info ==\\n\\nThere are quite a few [[police]] controls around Aachen, so make sure you are not bringing any drugs from the Netherlands to Germany as you might get controlled. Controls are for sure for buses, cars and even bicycles. Bus lines from the NL are being controlled, especially the line 50 from Maastricht if you get out at the main train station. Cars are more likely to be controlled if they have registration plates from other cities than Aachen.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[[Category:North Rhine-Westphalia|North Rhine-Westphalia]]\\n[[Category:E40]]\\n[[Category:Germany]]\\n\\n[[de:Aachen]]',\n",

It is also known as the city of smiles.\\n\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n\\n=== North towards [[Aalborg]], [[Frederikshavn]] ===\\n\\nTake the 14 bus from Århus city center towards Sabro and get off at Tilst Vestervej/Frømosevej. Walk to the crossroads next to Netto and turn right. There is a lane where cars can easily pull over, this is a great place to stand with a sign saying Aalborg. There is a traffic sign there which forbids pedestrians from walking along Viborgvej any further. This is the closest point on Viborgvej to the E45 highway onramp where you can safely hitchhike.\\n\\nCoordinates of this spot: 56°11\\'13.1\"N 10°05\\'15.6\"E\\n\\n=== North West towards [[Viborg]], [[Thisted]] and North West Jutland ===\\n\\nOne option is the same spot as described towards Aalborg and Fredrikshavn. \\n\\nAnother option is the bus stop Viborgvej/Hasle Ringvej on the second ring road in sight of the water tower. A lot of traffic passes by here and there is a lot of space for cars to pull over.\\n\\n=== West towards Silkeborg, [[Herning]] and West Jutland ===\\n\\nTake the 11 bus towards Harlev get off at \"Tre Ege/Silkeborgvej\" you can hitch a car from the busstop, make sure that they are going on highway 15, towards Herning\\n\\n\\n=== South towards South Jutland and [[Germany]] ===\\n\\nThe best spot to go is definitely located near \\'\\'Viby Torv\\'\\'. Take bus #1a, #6a, #4a, #200, or #14 towards \\'\\'Viby Torv\\'\\'. Get out there, walk some meters back to the big traffic light and go to the left into the \\'\\'Viby Ringvej\\'\\'. You\\'ll also recognize signs announcing the motorway. Walk along this street for around 1 km, then the on-ramp for the motorway appears. There\\'s enough space for you to stand on, easy to catch cars in all directions. Most cars are driving from the other direction, so it will be faster to cross the roads (you will have to cross a road where it is not allowed to walk by foot, and also go under a tunnel, but it takes only 2 minutes and it is really way more easy to catch a ride). Most cars stopping only goes to Skanderborg, but if you want to get further south (Germany), only accepting cars to at least Vejle Nord is a good idea, as there are so many cars stopping here, that you will eventually get a ride to at least Vejle in a short time. Here it pays to be patient!\\n\\nAnother great spot towards the south is Infoteria Petersminde. This is a highway restaurant which is frequented by a lot of traffic going towards the German border. From my experience it is way easier here to get a ride all the way to the German border than at the spot near Viby Torv. I actually started hitchhiking at the Viborgvej/hasle ringvej bus stop but you can also take a bus there or from the city towards tilst. You get off at the bus stop near Netto on Viborgvej. The next step is to subsequently follow grydhøjparken, Munkevejen, Bavnehøjvej, Lyngbygardsvej, and finally you turn left into a dirt road which leads to some sort of car dealership indicated on Google maps as SS Auto. There you will reach some woods which you will have to enter. There is a pathway which leads through the woods to the infoteria. \\n\\n\\n=== East towards [[Copenhagen]] ===\\n\\nGo to the harbour of Aarhus  and have a look for the ferry towards \\'\\'Sj. Odde (full name Sjællands Odde)\\'\\'. Wait in front of the terminals with a sign for Copenhagen, nearly everybody is going there. The drivers pay per car and not per person so it is free for them to bring you. You can find timetables for the ferry here: [http://www.mols-linien.dk/ Mols Linien]\\n\\n\\n== Other ==\\n\\nYou can get very good maps of Aarhus for free at the tourist information, it is inside the library Dokk1 located at the harbour, 700 m. from the train station. \\n\\nIn the library Dokk1 there is the tourist information and there are computers and WiFi that you can use for free. (wifi is called SmartAarhus - ask for someone\\'s danish phone number to log-in as a guest). You can also find lockers there where You can store your lugage for free in their opening hours, using a 20 kroner coin that you will get back.\\n\\nOn the train station there are luggage boxes where you can store your luggage ( 20 kroners per day for small one, 40 kroners for a big one).\\n\\n== Transport ==\\n\\nBicycyles\\n\\nThere used to be municipal bicycles (blue or colorful, with thick construction) which you could use for 20 kroners without any limitations (on the internet you can find a map of the stands for these bicycles. Many of them are already taken, so stands can be empty. If you manage to find one, be aware that quality is not perfect.) You can also often find abandoned bikes. If it looks quite trashy and is unlocked, you may adopt it.

It is known as the granite city and is a hub for the oil and gas industry operating in the north sea. It is a major public transport hub with links throughout the north east. \\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n=== South towards [[Dundee]], [[Edinburgh]] or [[Glasgow]] ===\\n\\nWork your way south of the river to Torry.\\nWalk onto the A956 (Wellington Road).\\nFollow the road A956 south over two roundabouts, the second of which is really big. There are good pavements all the way. \\nJust south of the big roundabout is a petrol station. \\nYou can also take the 3A bus instead of walking as it will drop you right at the petrol station\\nFrom experience thumbing is not very effective, be willing to approach people as they fill up their cars.\\n\\n\\n=== A96 North-West towards [[Inverness]], [[Elgin]] or [[Inverurie]]===\\n\\nEither take a bus or walk out from the city center towards the Bucksburn suburb, following the A96 urban dual-carriageway from the Huidagian Roundabout (from the Huidagian to the Bucksburn roundabout is roughly a 25 min walk).  After a while there is a large roundabout with a 'Lidl' supermarket and a MacDonalds above it.  Take the road just before the roundabout to the right, called 'Inverurie Road', it rejoins the A96 after a short time. Continue along the main A96, and after about ten minutes you will reach a bus stop. You can also reach this bus stop from city center with an arry of busses to save the walk.  \\n\\n=== A947 North towards Banff  ===\\n\\nThere are no good places to hitch from if you walk all the way to the edge of the Dyce suburb.  You are left with rural roads with nowhere safe nor possible for people to stop for a good distance. I would suggest either hitching from within the Dyce suburb or even closer to Aberdeen with a sign for Oldmeldrum.  Other options may be either to hitch to Inverurie and then take the backroad to Oldmeldrum (note: i have not tested this route myself!) or take the bus to Oldmeldrum and hitch onwards from there. \\nOnce on the A947 at Oldmeldrum it is quite easy to hitch from town to town.\\n\\n=== A93 Towards [[Braemar]]  ===\\n\\n=== A92 North towards Peterhead  ===\\nThe A92 is a dual carriage way with few suitable points to pick up hitchhikers from. The best place is a garage on the north side of the river Don. . You might need to approach drivers as thumbing when the trafic is moving so fast can prove a challenge. \\n\\n== Public Transport ==\\nAberdeen has a robust bus network streaching throughout the city. This can provide an easy way of moving about the town, but also a way to reach some of the hitching spots that are otherwise far outside of town. Fares are reasonable, but unavoidable as tickets must be purchased from the driver when you board the bus. There are also regional bus services, north to Inverness and Peterhead, south to [[Edinburugh]] and [[Glasgow]], as well as west towards [[Braemar]]. There is service from the flixbus network, so you can really catch a bus to anywhere. \\n\\nThere are two train stations within aberdeen. Dyce is on the [[Inverness]] to [[Aberdeen]] line, and serves as a link to the airport. The main railway station downtown has trains to [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Perth]], [[Dundee]] and [[London]]. There are automatic ticket barriers at the main station so avoiding fares can be a challenge.\\n\\nLastly, there are ferry connection to the [[Shetland Islands]] and [[Orkney Islands]]. These cannot be hitched, but passenger fares without a bearth are not expensive. You can offten ask around on the boat to find lifts to your final destination on the islands. \\n\\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\\n\\n[[nomad:Aberdeen]] [[trash:Aberdeen]]\\n\\n[[Category:Scotland]]\",\n",

The country is recognised only by a few states, including [[Russia]]. Western governments declared it as occupied by Russia, but you barely will see any of the Russian peacekeepers at all.\\n\\nAbkhazia was part of the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] SSR during Soviet times and most countries and the United Nations still consider it as a part of Georgia. Entering Abkhazia is illegal according to Georgian law. That\\'s why travelling from Russia via Abkhazia to Georgia is curently not possible or connected with quite some difficulties for holders of non CIS-passports (July 2011).\\n\\n=== Hitchhiking ===\\nHitchhiking in Abkhazia is definitely easy. It is recommended to read the [[E97]] article for specific information on hitchhiking in Abkhazia. Be aware that off the main road, especially in the southern districts, traffic can get very sparse. \\n\\nAbkhaz drivers love to drive very fast, be aware of that and get out whenever you\\'re afraid of crashing into roaming cows or horses along the way. Abkhaz police is very friendly in general, don\\'t be afraid to hitchhike next to their police posts. Nevertheless, hitchhiking is possible everywhere, even inside the capital, and you won\\'t wait long at all (most times, [[User:Platschi|platschi]] had no chance to even put his backpack off his shoulders).\\n\\n\\'\\'[[User:Redjo27|Redjo27]]: I went to Abkhazia in summer 2015 (which is tourist season) and I can say, that I had my worst hitchhiking experiences with locals there. They were shouting bad things, showing the middle finger and of course this had happened in other parts of the world as well, but not as often as in Abkhazia. Nearly everyone who stopped wanted money and one guy even a blow-job. I don\\'t want to advice against going to Abkhazia, but I can just disagree about hitchhiking being easy in Abkhazia.\\'\\'\\n\\n=== Cities ===\\n* [[Gagra]] (Abkhaz and Russian: Гагра; Georgian: გაგრა) \\n* [[New Athos]] (Abkhaz: Афон Ҿыц, Afon Ch\\'yts; Georgian: ახალი ათონი, Akhali Atoni; Russian: Новый Афон, Novy Afon)\\n* [[Pitsunda]]  (Abkhaz: Пиҵунда, Georgian: ბიჭვინთა, Bichvinta; Russian: Пицунда)\\n* [[Aqwa|Sukhum]] (Abkhaz: Аҟəа Aqwa, Georgian: სოხუმი, Russian: Сухуми)\\n* [[Gal]]i\\n\\n=== Entry Permit ===\\nHolders of CIS passports can enter Abkhazia without any obligations, whereas each other traveller has to get an entry permit and a visa on the spot in Sukhum. You can apply for an [http://www.mfaabkhazia.net/en/visa entry permit letter] online. [[User:Platschi|Platschi]] got his entry permit within two working days in June 2011. Afterwards, you have to get your visa at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in [[Aqwa|Sukhum]]. Note, that guards won\\'t let you into the building if you are wearing shorts. Price in 2011 was 20 USD (1 month tourist visa), to be payed beforehand in Rouble at a local bank or from 2012 you can pay in the ministry building. They don\\'t stick the visa into your passport, but if you do so yourself, you won\\'t be able to visit Georgia another time.\\n\\n=== Sleeping ===\\nAbkhazians are in general extremely hospitable, so you won\\'t have a hard time finding places to sleep there. Anyway, you can pitch your tent everywhere you want, just make sure not to be visible from the roads if you don\\'t want to have plenty of friendly visitors caring about your safety. Next to that, in the Northern districts many people rent their rooms to tourists for about 200-300 Rouble.\\n\\n=== Transit ===\\n; towards Georgia\\nTraveling from Russia towards Georgia is currently (April 2012) not possible. Georgians will not let you in, if they let you in it would mean that  have entered Georgia illegaly, according to Georgian law (Georgians did not check your passport on the border with Russia).\\n\\n; towards Russia \\nAccording to the \\'\\'Ministry of Foreign Affairs\\'\\' of Abkhazia \"transit from Georgia through Abkhazia to Russia is forbidden. You can only enter and back\" (December 2010).  Keep in mind though that you won\\'t get an exit stamp by the Georgians in case of leaving to Russia, thus when entering Georgia another time, you\\'ll most likely be not able to enter the country due to a missing exit stamp from the last time.\\n \\nNevertheless, as of April 2012 it was still possible to enter to Russia after coming from Georgia. User [[User:Rozwal|Rozwal]] asked at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs whether he could go to Russia and was informed that Abkhazia is not a transit country and that it was not allowed. He tried anyway and without any problem and any questions asked he entered to Adler in Russia.\\n\\n* \\'\\'[[User:Rozwal|Rozwal]]: I really could not understand the whole deal with crossing to Russia. Literally every person in Abkhazia told me that it was not possible but on LonelyPlanet I found a lot of relations from people that did it. I went and I did it. However, maybe if they asked me if I came from Georgia and I confirmed they would not let me out? In my passport it is not possible to see whether I came from Russia or Georgia since neither of them give you stamps (Georgians do not give you stamps when you go to Abkhazia, Abkhazians do not give you stamps at all, and Russians do not give stamps at border with Abkhazia). So maybe they just assumed that I came from Russia and that\\'s it? It is hard to say though. Anyway, after you cross to Russia after coming from Georgia, next time you come to Georgia, you are going to go to court and possibly to jail. As of July 2013, they are still working on changing the law to make it just a fine. But this is still not done. Good luck!\\n\\n=== Money ===\\nThere are only few ATMs in Abkhazia (mostly in the capital), so make sure to bring some cash with you. The official currency is the Russian Rouble, but you can exchange US Dollars and Euros in most towns.\\n\\n== Links ==\\n* [http://www.mfaabkhazia.net/en/visa Visa] and travel information {{en}}\\n* [http://www.couchsurfing.org/group_read.html?gid=14871&post=2286503 Forum] post with useful information {{en}}\\n* [http://abkhazia.travel/en/info Abkhazian travel information]  {{en}}\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n[[Category:Asia]]\\n[[Category:Abkhazia]]\\n{{IsIn|Western Asia}}',\n",

It would be a good place to ask the drivers and catch a ride. Asking for a ride to Port Augusta might be a good idea.<br />\\'\\'I waited in that station for about 15 minutes and got a ride to [[Port Augusta]] and from there a ride all the way to [[Perth]].<br />I think http://www.highway1touristpark.com/ is the caravan park with station next to it\\'\\' \\n# You can also stand on a random bus stop or other place along the A1 and try to hitch from there. You can get there with bus number 224 or 225 from King William st. in town. But try to avoid that if possible, it can get hot, there\\'s no shelter and people are not keen on stopping.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3\\'\\'\\'\\nI didn\\'t find the truck stop that these vague directions above gave me but I found a good space for hitching.\\n\\nFrom the centre of town get a train ticket to Salisbury Interchange. The train is quite regular even on a sunday so you can relax about getting there. From the Salisbury Interchange get the bus. During the week the 900 will take you right to the intersection of Port Wakefield and Waterloo Roads [http://timetables.adelaidemetro.com.au/timetables/routemaps/401-403-900_270909_routemap.pdf (map)]. In the weekend the 401 will get you near there and if you have a nice bus driver like i did might take you up to the roundabout to save you some walking. The intersection has traffic lights on a quick cycle so the traffic is reasonably slow and there is a large area along the side to pull into.\\n\\n=== Southeast towards [[Melbourne]] ===\\nHeading towards Melbourne, you could wait for a lift on Glen Osmond Road before it joins the South Eastern Freeway (which is also the Princes Highway), or further out of town along this highway at Crafers or Stirling.  A number of bus lines including the 840, 841F, 861, 863, or 864 can drop you off at the intersection of Cross Road and Glen Osmond Road, or further at Crafers, Stirling.  At the Cross/Glen Osmond intersection is still in city-area on a two-lane road, with a lot of local traffic and not very good visibility for cars to see the hitchhiker anywhere around this intersection until they are very close, further along you can stand at Crafers or Stirling small on-ramps to the highway which have less traffic but all are entering the highway and out of the city area. \\n\\nIn one hitcher\\'s experience, after the Glen Osmond intersection there isn\\'t really space to stand by the road, but the buses also go further along the freeway through Crafers, Arbury, Stirling and Mount Barker and you can try getting off any of these.  The first stop out of town is stop 16 and is just a small road with not so much traffic but you can have luck walking a few metres past the petrol station to stand before the ramp back onto the freeway (one hitcher waited just 15 mins here).  You could also take the bus further and find spots to stand at Crafers, Arbury, Stirling or Mount Barker where there will be more traffic. \\n\\nIn another hitcher\\'s experience at the Glen Osmond intersection, mid-morning Saturday was the best time to find long rides. During the week much of the traffic is local and not good for an inter-city trip. You could also aim to get a lift toward\\'s \"Murray Bridge\" (outside of Adelaide but in the direction of Melbourne) and get dropped off on a downhill section of the highway. Many trucks will pass you/pick you up heading to Melbourne.  Another hitcher found it difficult to get a ride from the intersection on the edge of the city, but rather had more luck taking the bus to a place just a little further out along the highway.\\n\\n\\n\\n== Things To Do In Adelaide ==\\nEverything is to find on [http://nomadwiki.org/en/Adelaide Nomadwiki]\\n\\n{{IsIn|Australia}}\\n[[trash:Adelaide]]\\n\\n[[Category:Australia]]\\n[[nomad:Adelaide]]',\n",

Afghanistan has the lowest rate of cars per inhabitant in the world. Travelling by public transport or staying in hotels is rather expensive compared to Central Asia.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Warning:\\'\\'\\'\\nInformation about hitchhiking in Afghanistan is hard to get, and usually a little old (2-5 years). The country is rapidly changing and some areas deemed \\'\\'safer\\'\\' by previous hitchhikers might now be more at risk. Make sure to check the local news and to ask around what the current reality is; and come back to update this page!\\n\\n== Hitchhiking culture ==\\n\\nAfghanistan has no tradition of hitchhiking for free. Those who flag down cars usually pay something for the transportation. Some Afghans might let you hitch a ride out of curiosity, but even if the hitchhiker makes it clear at the beginning of the ride that he cannot pay, the driver may still insist on payment when dropping the hitchhiker off. In some regions resp. seasons, hitching on trucks is the only way to travel. Most NGOs are forbidden to pick up hitchhikers, more specifically UN-based of large humanitarian organizations (nonetheless, in practice it\\'s mainly NGOs who pick hitchhikers up). If you choose to hitchhike, be prepared to be questioned by the police over and over again. Low literacy rates mean that using a sign is not necessary.\\n\\nIn the central part of Afghanistan hitching is most common on Russian \"Kamaz\" trucks, but can be extremely slow (100 km can takes up to 5h) because the roads there are more for the donkey caravans, not for the four wheel transport. Traffic is very low as well, it\\'s possible to wait up to 6 hours for the first truck to appear. About half of the times, the drivers want some money from you, but the other half of the drivers can be really funny and hospitable. \\n\\n[http://www.couchsurfing.org/people/belzas/ Justas] hitched successfully only in the central part of Afghanistan (Hazarajat) in 2007 and in northern Badakshan province (Ishkoshim to Faizabad) in 2010. From \\'\\'Bamyan\\'\\' to the incredible \\'\\'Band i Amir\\'\\' lakes and on to \\'\\'Chagcharan\\'\\', although he took the wrong way, got lost and had to trek in the isolated mountain valley for two days. He hitched back from \\'\\'Chagcharan\\'\\' to \\'\\'Bamyan\\'\\' and the north of the country. He intended to hitch all the way to \\'\\'Mazar e Sharif\\'\\', but while sitting in a jeep and crossing over the \\'\\'Solang\\'\\' tunnel, he was dragged out of the car by the northern alliance soldiers (on suspect of being a Taliban), held up for the evening in ruined military barracks in the mountains and then taken to the police station in the city to sleep (they said sorry afterwards). He also tried to hitch out of \\'\\'Mazar\\'\\' and out of \\'\\'Kunduz\\'\\', but both times unsuccessfully and just took public transport after hours of waiting.\\n\\n[[User:Xnothingxheldxbackx|Taylor]] tried to hitch in Afghanistan in 2009, dressed as a local. He was confused for one several times and it might not have helped him because showing yourself as a foreigner will attract attention to you, especially from people trying to protect you. The downside is that it makes you also easier to spot for Talibans or other radicals. He got his ride on buses paid by kind people as he didn\\'t manage to really hitch.\\n\\n=== Maps ===\\n\\n* [http://www.aims.org.af/maps/national/routh_maps/road_network/road_network.pdf A recent road map of Afghanistan (2004)]\\n\\n== Cities ==\\n[[Kabul]], [[Herat]], [[Kandahar]], [[Mazar-e Sharif]], [[Jalalabad]], [[Ghazni]], [[Kunduz]]\\n\\n== Public Transport ==\\n\\nCollective taxis with fixed fares travel between cities once they are filled with passengers. Travelling with a backpack there means extra cost, but that\\'s where you can bargain. There are also minibuses, a bit cheaper but much more crowded. \\n\\n== Safety ==\\n\\nIt\\'s probably quite an unsafe country to travel to let alone to hitchhike even though Muslim hospitality might make up for that. Be aware that land mines are widespread in the country. Known fields are marked with cobblestones painted red (towards the field) and white (safer zone). They are identified MF (Mine Field) and LM (Land Mines). Another concern is around the opium traffic route - through the Panj river.\\n\\nIn 2006, a Russian hitchhiker travelling in Afghanistan went missing. For more information, read [http://www.digihitch.com/ftopict-6046.html here]. However, the feeling in the Russian community is that this hitchhiker perished while trying to ford a river or negotiate a cliff, and not from violence.\\n\\n=== Women ===\\n\\nWoman have hitchhiked in Afghanistan in the company of one or more male hitchhikers. It goes without saying that women are advised to cover as much hair and skin as possible when travelling in Afghanistan. This is not only a matter of safety, but of respect as well. Consider a \\'\\'salwar kameez\\'\\' dress with proper headgear. Afghan women do not chat up men in public, or make eye contact with them, or smile to them. Keep in mind that your behaviour and body language might send strong messages to men. Avoid all physical contact in public. It is generally advised to travel with a male companion.\\n\\nWomen travelling alone in group taxis generally have to pay for two seats at the front rather than be allowed to sit next to a man.\\n\\n== Border Crossing ==\\n\\nHitchhikers have crossed to Afghanistan:\\n* from [[Iran]] via Eslam Qal\\'eh. Advice given by locals is to reach Kabul using the ring road via Kandahar in the South since it is a main road used by international peace keeping forces. \\n* from [[Pakistan]], via Torkham. The trip from Peshawar to Kabul takes about 7 hours.You must obtain a free permit the morning of the departure and a have a bodyguard accompanying you to the border. There is also a checkpoint via Chaman.\\n* from [[Tajikistan]], via Panji Poyon.\\n* from [[Turkmenistan]]\\n* from [[Uzbekistan]], via Termez on the Afghanistan–Uzbekistan Friendship Bridge, it used to be off-limits but I personally crossed this border 4 years ago.\\n\\n== Eating & Drinking ==\\n\\nFood should be approached with a discerning eye, hygiene standards can often be lacking. Hot, freshly cooked food is generally safer. Bottled water is also advised, unless you have your own purification system.[http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Afghanistan#Stay_healthy]\\n\\n== Accommodation & Sleeping ==\\n\\nWhile hotels in [[Kabul]] can be extremely expensive, attempting to camp in the street will attract local people, who will then insist you stay in their homes.\\n\\nIn the centre of Afghanistan you can sleep in road side restaurants (mostly just mud buildings) for free as long as you eat dinner and breakfast there.\\n\\n== Other Useful Info ==\\n\\n* [http://www.digihitch.com/article987.html Pashtunistan, Moses, and the Lizard...

Walk further down to the roundabout marked \"Marrakesh\". Often Moroccans are also hitching from there.\\n\\n[[File:agadireast.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The hitchhiking point for Marrakesh]]\\n\\n=== North to [[Essaouira]] ===\\n\\nThere is a coastal road straight north to Essaouira. Between Agadir and the town of [[Tamri]], hitchhiking is easy. The beaches along this stretch are popular surf-spots and traffic is relatively high. To the north of Tamri, the traffic density gets lower, but the scarcity of villages ensures long distance rides.\\n\\nTo hitch along the coastal road, get yourself somehow to the harbour, where the road up the mountain castle starts. There the road to Essaouira begins. Hitchhiking here is supereasy.\\n\\n=== South to Tiznit, Tafraoute; East to Taroudant ===\\n\\nTake the bus 12, which goes from Hay Mohammadi neighborhood at the North through the intercity bus station to Ait Melloul at the South. Go to the last stop at the ring square just 100 m South of the river Oued Sous. From there choose your direction. You can walk a few kilometers till you reach the ring road, or you can take a bus which can bring you to any village outside of Agadir for a few dirhams. For Tiznit you need Avenue Hassan II, for Tafraoute – Avenue Mohamed VI, for Taroudant – Avenue Mohamed V. Also many drivers which go to Taroudant choose the road to Marrakesh and then turn right on their way.\\n\\n=== Hitching boats ===\\n\\nThe Agadir Marina is rather small but bigger than the ones in Essaouira and Mohammedia. It should be ideal for hitching boats to Canary Islands in the end of the hurricane season (November-December), but the border control guys are unpredictable\\n\\n\\nThe marina is really small, when I arived there were only 17 sailboats. But for me it worked very well. It took me only about 30 minutes to find a lift to Canaries (i am lucky bastard). I was there in half of december and there were more boats going to Canaries and from there  continueing to Senegal, Cape verde or across the ocean to America. But locals also told me about a hitchhiker who was looking here for a boat 2 weeks. You never know...\\n\\n== Sleeping ==\\n\\nAbout 20km north of Agadir, along the coastal road, you\\'ll find the surfer village of Tarazout. About 1.5\\xa0km north of this village, there\\'s a small lonely hotel/pension, just next to it you\\'ll find a great empty beach for camping. There\\' also some caves where locals are kind of living. Hitchhiking from up the road to both directions is straightforward and easy.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|Souss-Massa-Draâ}}\\n\\n[[Category:Morocco]]\\n[[Category:Souss-Massa-Draâ]]',\n",

However if you intend to cross the mountains and go to Batumi you should prepare yourself for a hitchhiking challenge as people from this area actually prefer going around the mountains rather than crossing them (roughly a 400 kilometers instead of 150) due to the dire state of the road. Even though you could be lucky you should prepare yourself for some village to village hitchhiking. The first 20 kilometers are pretty easy, the next 20 are pretty hard and after that it actually became so hard (20 hours without a single car in the right direction) that hitchhiker [[Theo]] actually gave up and went back to Akhaltsikhe instead.\\n\\n=== South towards Akhalkalaki, Vardzia, Ninotsminda, Gyumri ([[Armenia]]) ===\\n\\nFor these destinations simply walk to the eastern end of Rustavelli street and hitch once you reach the junction.

From there to Vardzia traffic is very light, (tourist buses and rental cars aside). If you have no luck, there are Marshrutkas that run every few hours. Keep in mind that the last Marshrutka returning from Vardzia departs at 4pm - given that traffic between here and Khertvisi is non existent, it might be wisest to take this. The driver will drop you off at Khertvisi castle if you're travelling onwards to Akhalkalaki/Armenia etc.\\n\\nGyumri - As this region has a sizable Armenian minority, there is plenty of movement between here and Gyumri. You should get to Ninotsminda and hitch from there. There are only some minor villages between Ninotsminda and Gyumri.

Don’t refuse lift offers for [[Avsallar]], a town about 20-25 km west, where you can get quicker lifts.\\n\\nIf you don't want to walk it's possible to take bus number 2 to the fınal stop (1.25 TL) and then walk about 100 meters to a good spot or 200 meters to a spot under a brıdge (sweet shadow)\\n\\n=== East towards [[Anamur]], [[Taşucu]], [[Silifke]], [[Mersin]] ===\\nThe junction with traffic lights above a beach at the town (or, more like suburb) of [[Mahmutlar]] some distance east of downtown Alanya seems to be best place to hitch east but still, expect to wait for hours before being picked up. Remember to bring lots of water if it's summer (as it seems there is no grocery/convenience store nearby despite the huge number of residential buildings lining the highway).\\n\\n== Sleeping ==\\nIf coming from the east ([[Mersin]]), at the beginning of town you'll recognize a big hotel called Utopia. and it looks like a castle on a rock including a big elevator down to the beach, you can't miss it. It even has a fake medıeval wall around it. Some 500-1000m further, along the road next to the sea, on the left side there's a camping site called ''Camping Perle'', located at the beginning of town. On the other side of the camping there are some banana plantations, and further on you can find a service station. It's possible to sleep on the beach for free. You can even use the deckchairs of the camping, the owner seemed to be quite relaxed with it. It's also quite a safe place.\\n\\n[[User:Vidimian|Vidimian]] slept on a bench in the waterfront park in the city centre in an April night. Although nothing bad had happened, it was really cold, probably because of the humid breeze from the sea.\\n\\nThere also seems to be secluded spots to sleep rough inside the city walls (when entered from the gate next to the Red Tower, ''Kızıl Kule''). Just walk uphill for a few minutes to be far enough from any house.\\n__NOTOC__\\n\\n[[Category:D400 (Turkey)|D400]]\\n[[Category:D400 (Turkey)]]\",\n",

For these reasons, most vehicles that do pass will most likely stop for hitchhikers, but trying to travel to precise locations and/or long distances is not recommended. On the other hand, Alaska in winters can be spectacular as you have the higher chance to see \\'Aurora borealis\\'. \\n\\nIn summer it is great though. You can get from [[Fairbanks]] to [[Prudhoe bay]] in 2 days on the  [[Dalton Highway]] . Be careful with hungry grizzly, black and polar bears though.\\n\\nThere are few roads in Alaska that cover any real distance that are not highways. Fortunately, most of the time, the highways are much more friendly than the interstates of the Lower 48. The epic and beautiful scenery calls for a huge number of turnoffs, giving the hitchhiker ample opportunity to walk down the road a bit and still have a decent spot. Many drivers are willing to stop, even from full speed, if they have a place to pull over, and they often do. Some would even slow down as just as they see you and stop where are you standing or walking.\\n\\nBy far the busiest stretch of road in Alaska is the Glenn Highway from Anchorage north to Wasilla and Palmer (in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley). It is illegal for pedestrians to be on the highway itself, so normal freeway rules apply here. (But I have never waited more than fifteen or twenty minutes for a ride, even while standing on a full speed stretch of that road).\\n\\nThe longest rides you can get are from hilltop cafe(couple of miles north of fair banks ) to the \\nThe farther one travels from Anchorage, the less traffic there is, particularly during winter. However, the Kenai Peninsula and the Parks Highway (up through Denali, to Fairbanks) are populated roadways all year long. The good thing about this is that you\\'re likely to find a ride that is going where you are, or maybe even farther. That being said, one trip from Wasilla to Kenai (less than three hundred miles) took me a day and a half and ten rides.\\n\\nThe Alaska Highway from Dawson Creek in Canada runs to Delta Junction in Alaska, and then continues on to Fairbanks as the Richardson Highway.  It took us a while to travel from Delta Junction and then later Tok Junction to the Canadian border, and locals seem more keen to give lifts than tourists (as a rule of thumb the more expensive the RV the worse reception you get) so you may not get very far at one go.  That said, people will eventually stop and can be incredibly friendly and helpful to the point of giving you food and beds when they do.\\n\\nIn summer, it\\'s not such a big deal to be caught out at some late hour. You may not even realize that it\\'s midnight! Twenty hours of daylight is the norm, and at \\'night\\' it still does not get dark enough even to see the stars. However, be particularly careful during the colder months, because getting stuck at the Seward Y at 10 p.m. can be very scary. Drivers are usually careful during the winter and may not drive so much at night, but it is likely that the first car that passes will stop for you. \\n\\nWhatever the weather, always have an extra layer or two with you. The weather here can and will change violently in a matter of minutes, and the temperature can drop very, very quickly. \\n\\n== Law ==\\n13 AAC 02.180. Pedestrians soliciting rides or business\\n\\nNo person may solicit a ride in a manner which distracts a driver\\'s attention, nor may a pedestrian upon a highway solicit employment, business, or contributions from the occupant of a vehicle. \\n\\nIt appears that hitchhiking may be illegal in some contexts if the hitcher is being obnoxious and drawing unreasonable attention to themselves (a good way to get a ride elsewhere.)\\n\\n== Cities ==\\n* [[Anchorage]]\\n* [[Fairbanks]]\\n* [[Juneau]]\\n* [[Prudhoe bay]]\\n\\n== Experiences ==\\n\\'\\'After having hitched most of the major highways in the state, I can confidently rate it as well above average for hitchhiking.

The capital is [[Tirana]]. It has borders to [[Montenegro]], [[Kosovo]], [[North Macedonia]] and [[Greece]].\\n\\nThe road network is not very complicated, and getting out from and past towns is usually just a matter of walking in the right direction. Roads do tend to go through the towns, but keep an eye out for signs for shortcuts to avoid tedious walking when transiting. In Albania there are lots of round-abouts, even on some motorways, these are perfect places to hitch!\\n\\n== Hitchhiking culture ==\\n\\n[[Hitchhiking]] in Albania can go surprisingly well. Even though Albania is still one of the poorest countries in [[Europe]], the country\\'s living conditions have improved greatly in the past years. \\n\\nPeople are usually friendly and ready to help. Be aware some drivers expect money, since private taxi is a major form of public transport. A very easy way to avoid misunderstandings (if you are strict about hitchhiking) is to say \"autostop, jo lek\" - \"hitchhiking, no money\" while showing the thumb up sign (\"jo\" is pronounced \"yo\"). This is very clear to drivers and they will either drive away or pick you up anyway. \\n\\nHitchhiking with a sign can be useful to differentiate yourself from the other people using public transportation, but on smaller roads a thumb is enough (and might actually make things easier since people might not be going far and it\\'s hard to know what to put on your sign). The only place a sign is really useful is to get out of [[Tirana]]\\n \\n[[Image:Albania hh truck.jpg|right|thumb|Hitching down from [[Theth]] at the back of a truck.]]Many private minibuses join the main cities via the main roads. There are no bus stops, so they may stop when they see you hitchhiking. They are quite cheap, for example a ride from [[Tirana]] - [[Shkodër]] (120 km) costs 500 Lek (about EUR 3.5). Thus, it may happen that they pick you for free if you say that you don\\'t have money. \\n\\nAlso, make sure to keep an eye on the road -- if the driver makes sudden turns and other similar actions while driving it is likely that he is either a taxi driver or that he thinks he is doing good by bringing you to the local bus station, and would expect some money from you. You therefore will have to be reiterative on stating that you travel by \\'\\'\\'autostop\\'\\'\\'. This kind of driver behaviour usually is not valid for the company car or truck drivers\\': they are already salaried and won\\'t be offering a taxi service to you.\\n\\nWomen hitchhiking alone do not encounter more issues than the average European country.\\n\\n[[File:100_1393.JPG|200px|thumb|left|Border Crossing from North Macedonia at Ohrid Lake]]\\n[[File:tirana.jpg|right|thumb|typical road scene in Tirana]]\\n\\n== Safety ==\\n\\nAlbania has a good hitchhiking reputation. The government financial trust in [[police]] force has lifted up the safety level in most areas of the country; however, it is paramount to remain cautious, and hitching by night as well as in some areas might not be too wise. Beware of the poorest area and hitching next to slums since you will be quickly dragging the attention of dozens of children lurking at your bags, and would make almost impossible for you to get out of there, so if you find yourself around such place just walk away and ignore the people until you are in a better area.\\n\\n== Cities ==\\n\\n* [[Tirana]]\\n* [[Durrës]]\\n* [[Shkodër]]\\n* [[Berat]]\\n* [[Lushnjë]]\\n* [[Elbasan]] \\n* [[Vlorë]] \\n* [[Sarandë]]\\n* [[Gjirokaster]]\\n* [[Korça]]\\n\\n=== Other places ===\\n* [[Theth]] (village & national park)\\n* [[Borsh]] (village with a wonderful beach)\\n\\n== Eating & Drinking ==\\n\\nIn Tirana (and probably in other cities, too) you can find very cheap local food markets with really good and fresh vegetables, such as tomatoes, cucumbers, green peppers, olives, etc. Local olive oil and freshly baked bread is something everyone has to taste!\\n\\n== Accomodation & Sleeping ==\\n\\nIn Tirana one can easily get accommodated in so called private sector: these are people who have their apartments arranged to accepts occasional tourists. It is safe, quite cheap (you can talk about how much you can pay), you get friendly company (if needed) and tips how and where. To find these kind of places just ask some more tidily looking folks on the street, or in Internet cafes and other similar places.\\nThere is a nice and individual hostel in the center of Tirana. Tirana Backpacker Hostel, Rruga Elbasanit 85, Tirana.\\nFor free you can stay at Couchsurfer house. Albanians are very good hosts and they can help you by showing the city you will stay or giving directions.\\n\\n[[User:MOAH|Mind of a Hitchhiker]] had an awesome time freecamping and squatting in Albania. There\\'s lots of building going on in Albania, especially at the coast in [[Sarandë]] there\\'s a whole rise of ugly concrete structures, presumably to launder money. There\\'s not enough people who actually buy those apartments, so squatting is really doable for the night if you manage to sneak in unnoticed. There\\'s empty buildings in the whole country. If you walk about 4km north of [[Dürres]] centre there\\'s a few beaches and hills excellent for pitching a tent.\\n\\n== Personal Experiences ==\\n\\nAlbania is a great country for hitchhiking. Although beware there is some kind of taxi \\'mafia\\' on the Albanian side of the border when entering Albania from Greece between Ioannina and Gjirokastër. Twice now taxi drivers there have prevented me from hitching further into Albania. \\n\\nIn July 2022 (and back in ~2017 a similar situation occurred) we walked across the border and stopped a ride going to Sarandë between the border and the taxi stands. The taxi drivers rushed over and told us and the driver that its illegal to hitchhike there. I guess the taxi guys threatened the driver with something, and he was afraid to take us after that. \\n\\nBest to not try and stop a car until you\\'re past the taxi stands and out of sight of them. keep walking to the gas station around the corner and if they ask where your going tell them you\\'re meeting someone. Keep walking further down the road if they hassle you at the gas station.\\n\\n== Links ==\\n\\n[http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Albanian_phrasebook Albanian Phrasebook] on Wikivoyage\\n\\n[http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Albania Albania] on Wikivoyage\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|Balkans}}\\n__NOTOC__\\n\\n[[Category:Albania]]\\n[[Category:Southern Europe]]\\n\\n[[de:Albanien]]\\n[[fr:Albanie]]\\n[[pl:Albania]]',\n",

At first blush, this city is very bad for hitchhiking. Many rude suburbanites flying by you, cops harassing you, and generally rough on-ramps nearly everywhere. If one is careful and strategic, however, getting through Albany in any direction can be a breeze. Knowing the bus system is a good move, and there are several spots worth knowing for departure out of it anywhere.\\n\\n== Going North ==\\nThere are two good ways to head north that (Hillbilly Castro) has noticed. One is the exit on I-87 north out of Colonie Mall, near Whole Foods. Wide shoulder, lots of traffic, good cover from police, and many people heading to good points northward. If you hitchhike here, do not get off at the Clifton Park rest area - there is a police station here and many of the officers stationed here hate travelers. I was pushed around and had my stuff dumped into the slush by an officer there, threatened arrest, and told to leave, though I had no way to legally exit the area on foot. If you are judicious about the rides you accept, you can get all the way to Saratoga Springs - a great exit for rides far north (the exit by Wilton Mall).\\n\\nThe other good way, if you have a couple bucks and some time, is to take the 450 bus from Schenectady to Wilton Mall in Saratoga Springs. This is a sure shot for avoiding harassment and getting really nice rides. The bus is $2 and takes one hour (take the bus from Albany to Schenectady and get a transfer - there are a couple buses that go there.)\\n\\n== Going West ==\\nThis is the most challenging direction to exit Albany from. Take the bus to Colonie and walk on route 20 to hitch towards Duanesburg. Alternatively, there is an exit in East Schodack, accessible by the 233 bus, that is on the \"free\" section of interstate 90. Hitch here with a sign that says \"past Albany\". Most at this exit are going into Albany, but with a few hours wait, you may be able to find someone traveling long-distance from MA. The Pattersonville rest area on the Thruway is hitchable if you keep a low profile. This is easier to do at night. This rest area is maybe 20 miles west of Albany.\\n\\n== Going East ==\\nTake the 233 bus to East Schodack, on route 20, signs up for Pittsfield, MA. This is a quite easy hitch generally.\\n\\n== Going south, [[New York City]] ==\\nAvoid I-87. Take the 233 bus to East Schodack and hitch south on route 9. This will be slower than the thruway, but will be more pleasant and will get you less harassment.\\n\\n[[Category:Illegal to hitchhike]]\\n[[Category:New York]]',\n",

Hitchhiking in Algeria is common and legal especially outside of the big cities. The Algerian-Moroccan border is closed, as well as the Algerian-Mali-border. In the north most people speak French, in the desert it\\'s mainly Arabic and Berber. French or Arabic is a HUGE asset in the country. Hitching without either would probably be fairly difficult.\\n\\n==Getting In==\\nThe best option is probably taking a boat from Almeria, Spain. The only company is Transmediterranea, which runs two boats a week to Oran for between 50 and 100 euros (depending on the time of year). Other options are flying into Algiers or Oran from Europe, however flights are usually cheaper into Tunis, Tunisia, from which you can get in overland. Hitchhiking in from Tunisia will not pose a problem at the border, though it is not a bad idea to communicate with your driver that you can both pretend he is a taxi driver as to hide the fact you are getting into a police state by hitchhiking.\\n[[File:AlgeriaSahara.JPG|thumb|300px|right|[[User:PhysicsHipster|PhysicsHipster]] hitchhiking in the Algerian Sahara.]]\\n\\n==Safety==\\nThe country is quite calm and safe, and has been largely stigmatized by the media. The civil war of the 90s and 00s is long finished. That being said, it is best to avoid the area around Bouira in the north, where there have been a few travelers taken hostage in the last few years. Also avoid the Libya-Algeria border, and ESPECIALLY the Niger-Algeria border, where there has been a fair bit of violence and terrorism in the past. Tourists are also not allowed south of El Oued without being accompanied by an Algerian guide, although this may not be enforced. There are regular police checkpoints along all roads so be sure to have your travel documents with you at all times.\\n\\nThat being said if you are a female traveler keep in mind the more south you go the more conservative it gets so some places don\\'t really feel to safe. Having a male traveler with you or wearing a hijab is not a bad idea for deterring potential harassment.\\n\\n== Visa Procedure ==\\nMost nationalities will need a visa to get into Algeria. The procedure can be somewhat daunting. You will most likely need:\\n* Proof of transportation in/out\\n* Hotel reservation\\n* Travel insurance\\nHowever, there is some leeway. The proof of transportation in can be your boat/plane ticket (They may let you get around this if you explain you expect to book the boat later on), and then you can just explain you will leave via Tunisia. The Hotel you can buy and then when you have your visa you can cancel it all for 100% refund (Expedia gives full refunds, but perhaps call them to make sure). The travel insurance is probably worth it, as it is only around 2 or 3$ each day, but if you want you could theoretically also cancel that as well. Even if you only have proof you have a hotel for a few nights, the minimum visa length they will issue is 30-days, starting from the first day of your hotel reservation, so you can reserve just a few nights and still travel the country for a month but make sure that you have your reservations for the full length of your \"official\" stay meaning if you have proof of getting into the country on date X and getting out of it on date Y have a hotel booked from X to Y.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'For any information about visa procedure contact this guy here [https://www.couchsurfing.com/people/el-houcine-brahim].

It even beat out other hitchhiking heavyweights like Morocco, Japan, and New Zealand. Wait times were usually a minute or two. I think the longest I waited was 10 minutes. People were incredibly generous and often gave me food, money, or even a place to stay. Even getting out of big cities like Algiers I had no trouble. I just took the metro east as far east as I could go and then just found a spot with some shoulder and the 2nd car that passed picked me up!

After going to the embassy they told us they absolutely need information of where we are staying for the duration of the trip as a formality so most certainly just book a hotel for the entirety of your stay and then cancel it once you have the visa. Other than starting the procedure three weeks before we got the visa the rest is pretty easy!\\'\\'\\n\\n== Cities ==\\n* [[Algiers]] (capital)\\n* [[Annaba]]\\n* [[Oran]]\\n* [[Sidi bel abbes]]\\n* [[Mostaganem]]\\n\\n== Borders ==\\n\\nThe border to [[Morocco]] is closed.\\nThe only open borders actually are with Tunisia, there is some fake news about Mauritania borders but nothing sure, for more informations contact local people in Tindouf.\\n\\n== Money, internet and accommodation ==\\nNever change your money in the bank or exchange offices as the official rate is much lower than the black market rate. Instead ask around touristic places or the bazaar about exchanging money with someone and they will most certainly direct you to someone who\\'s willing to do it. At the time of writing (September 2023) the black market exchange rate is 227DZD for 1 Euro but you will most likely get offers of 220DZD for 1 Euro which is completely fine as Algeria is super cheap.\\n\\nWi-fi is not widely available in Algeria, most bars and cheap hotels don\\'t have it and people that host you often won\\'t. Mobilis is the best network to get internet from as it is not only cheap but covers most of Algeria well, including the south. Expect to pay 400DZD for a SIM card and 1000 DZD for 30 gigabytes (all together 7 euro) which should be enough for the duration of your stay.\\n\\nSince tourism is largely nonexistent in Algeria you will not find backpacker hostels or cheap accommodation on booking or other online websites. Instead you should go directly to Google maps and type in \"hotel\", \"Dar\", \"Dortoire\", \"مرقد\", \"نزل\", \"مرقد في تونس\", \"مرقد في بنزت\" in the city you want to go to, although hotel usually works fine. In the reviews people often leave the price which you should expect to be about 1500DZD (7 euro) for a night. Double rooms are usually 2000-2500 so if you have a travel buddy paying 5 euro per person a night is the expected price. Even if you find nothing online you should be able to find an area in which there are plenty of hotels and can then go to that area in person and find some cheap places, or just ask around. Mind the fact that if you do end up sleeping in a hotel most of them close at midnight so you are not fully free to do as you want.\\n\\n== Personal experiences ==\\n\\'\\'September 2023: it feels a bit stupid writing about Algeria on hitchwiki since we barely did any hitchhiking but nonetheless this information will probably be helpful to someone. First of all Algerians are fantastic people, they will host you and help you every step of the way and their hospitality and generosity is one of a kind and rarely not genuine since they are not used to tourists. Once you connect with someone you are their guest and you will be fed, have a place to sleep, get gifts etcetc to the point where it\\'s hard to escape and go to your next destination. That being said most of them will tell you Algeria is completely safe which I never fully bought. Since it is a poor country you will see a lot of shady places and shady looks, police sirens, fights etc. Nothing bad ever happened to us nor were we ever close to a negative situation but I would advise you to keep your eyes open, especially in Algiers and some less touristic places and especially if you are a woman. The more south you go the more conservative it gets and my partner got more than a few odd looks because she wasn\\'t wearing a hijab and once, while walking alone in Ouargla, got followed by someone on a motorcycle for five minutes or so. I am not at all writing this to deter anyone from visiting this wonderful country, on the contrary Algeria is a site to behold and Algerians are amazing, but to remind people to keep their focus even though everyone is so good to you and maybe opt for accommodation instead of wildcamping. Other good advice is to know a bit of French, but keep in mind a lot of Algerians don\\'t speak French fluently, and definitely don\\'t just stick to the coast as the south is like a completely different country that is absolutely fascinating. A fantastic place with some of the most genuine people you will ever meet, and almost no scams. Algeria is an absolute adventure.\\'\\'\\n-[[User:JanV|JanV]]\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|Maghreb}}\\n\\n[[Category:Algeria]]\\n\\n[[de:Algerien]]\\n[[zh:阿尔及利亚]]\\n[[visa:Algeria]]\\n[[nomad:Algeria]]',\n",

Get out at the last stop, walk 100 meters and you\\'ll see the city sign with \"Alytus\" crossed out. This is the spot. Also you can hitchhike directly at AB \"Dainava\" bus station, cars can easilly pull over. about 5 km, the road splits into the directions of Vilnius and [[Druskininkai]] (or [[Hrodna]] in [[Belarus]]). The driver should know where to let you out, if you want to skip this - have a sign with your destination on it.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Kaunas]], [[Klaipėda]], [[Latvia]] ===\\n\\nTake a bus 1, 1A, 2,  4, 4A, 6, 7, 8, 8U, 9, 9U, 10, 10A, 11 ([http://i.imgur.com/2Em7C2z.png| Public transportation map]). You can get off when you see the bus station: it is at the end of the city, together with \"Maxima\" shop, there is a small lake Gulbynė on the other side of the road. You can hitch-hike from there, on the shore of Gulbynė. With buses  8, 8U, 9, 9U, 10, 10A you can go past the bus station and get off when they turn right. This spot is right at the end of the city, so there is less local traffic.\\n\\n=== West/Southwest towards [[Marijampolė]], [[Poland]] ===\\n\\nYou need to reach roundabout.

When you reach the crossroad (it\\'s called \\'\\'Simno sankryža\\'\\' by locals), the road straight goes towards [[Marijampolė]]. If you are going towards Poland, you have two choices. First is to turn left and go through Lazdijai (road to [[Augustow]]): cars that go from Vilnius to [[Warsaw]] usually take this road, but trucks cannot go here. The second is to go straight, in the direction of Marijampolė, through Kalvarija and [[Suwalki]], where most trucks go. Which way is better, is still a matter of discussion.\\n\\n== Accommodation and Sleep ==\\n\\nAlytus has two parks and a big forest next to the city, which are fine to sleep in summer. Also, you can use CouchSurfing or other hospitality networks: even though there are not to many people from Alytus there, they are usually excited about hosting someone (due to lack of foreigners in the city). If anything, you might try reaching the city park (\\'\\'Miesto parkas\\'\\') and looking for some young non-formal people under the roof of art school (\\'\\'Dailės mokykla\\'\\') or in the park: especially in summer, there are lots of youngsters there, and some might agree to host a weary traveler if you are nice enough. \\n\\n== Public transportation ==\\n\\nThere is public transport in Alytus. One-way ticket 0.60 EUR cents 0.30 EUR cents for students, schoolchildren and seniors (a document is required). You can also use your feet: Alytus is not too big, it takes about 1-1.5 hour to go from one end of the city to the other.\\n\\nNote that minibuses 8, 1A, 1, 8, 9 can bring you from the hitch-hiking spot for Kaunas/Latvia (the bus station) to the spot for Vilnius/Belarus (end of the city) and vice-versa in one ride: save your feet, as it takes about 1.5 hour to get from one point to another.\\n\\n[[Category:Lithuania]]\\n[[ru:Алитус]]\\n{{IsIn|Lithuania}}\\n{{Category|City\\'s}}',\n",

Here you will find a lot of traffic going straight to Haarlem, and possibly even cars going to Leiden, and further to Delft and Den Haag. Though, most cars going there will use the Ring A10 and then the A4 to Den Haag.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Alkmaar]], [[Zaandam]] ===\\n====Option 1====\\n{{Coords|52.3924|4.8450}}<br>\\nThere is a bus stop on the on-ramp {{Anl|10}} ''Sloterdijk station''.

This road leads to the ramp of the S112 of the {{Anl|10}}, the motorway around Amsterdam (direction {{Anl|1}} and {{Anl|2}}. This is currently being turned into a third lane and is completely unusually for hitching a ride. \\n\\n====Option 2, BP petrol station====\\n{{Coords|52.3473|4.9256}}<br>\\nA little further on that road, which is called ''Gooiseweg'', and behind the bend you will find a BP petrol-station where you can talk to drivers, often a better way for getting a ride. The petrol station is easily accessible from the backstreets, and it is very easy to hail a ride from the side of the road immediately after the petrol station.\\n\\nMost cars here will drive along the A1 towards Amersfoort, Hengelo and Germany. The first petrol-station is just 8 kilometres further, just after [[Muiden]]], a second petrol station and parkingspot, called ''De Slaag'' is located 37 kilometres from Amsterdam, right before [[Amersfoort]].\\n\\n====Option 3, BP Honswijck petrol station in Muiden ====\\n{{Coords|52.3209|5.0788}}<br>\\nFirst you go by train, tram, metro or bus to the station ''Amsterdam Amstel''. From there three bus lines, 320, 322 and 327, are going to busstop P+R Terrein in [[Muiden]]. A presale ticket costs EUR 2,90 for all buses (GVB 1 uur ticket). In the bus you pay EUR 5 for bus lines 322 and 327 or EUR 4.20  for bus line 320 (numbers/ticket price may be outdated). \\n\\nStep out at P+R Terrein in Muiden, walk south ''Weesperweg'' for 200m, then turn left crossing the canal with the bridge ''Spieringburg''/''Mariahoeveweg'' for 200m, then 400m south along the ''Vecht'' canal eastbank on ''Lange Muiderweg''. Now comes the unverified part: walk 800 meter east behind the noise breaker along the motorway and you will be at A1 BP-service station Honswijck. \\n* Comment: I tried this in 2018. Walking behind the noise breaker is a bit of an adventure - part of the terrain there is marshy, so you need to climb up to the concrete ridge on the back of the noise breaker and walk along it - but totally doable and once you're on the other side, you've got a good place to get a hitch. [[User:MatsumotoJoe|MatsumotoJoe]]\\n\\n[[File:IMGP0763.jpg|right|thumb|266px|Hitchhikers at the Prins Bernhardplein liftplaats]]\\n\\n====Option 4, [[Hengelo]]==== \\nHush AVIA highway petrol station / rest stop (out of city by train)\\n Train ticket to Hengelo is ±25 euro.\\nThere is often a lot of competition at the ''liftplaats'' and drivers usually only go short distances, so by the time you have finally left Holland you will have had approx. 3–6 rides. You can easily avoid this by taking a train to [[Hengelo]]. From the train station ''Hengelo'' take bus 14 to ''Bruninkshoek''. You now find yourself on the street ''Oostelijke Esweg''. Walk in the direction the bus just came from towards the street ''Hasselerbaan'', then turn left. Walk down until you cross ''Oldenzaalsestraat''. Turn left and you will see a footbridge overlooking the A1. When you have crossed the bridge, don't turn right but walk through the grass and descend down. Turn left before the ditch and walk with the ditch on your right. Continue until you see a little forest; here you have to jump over a small ditch. Walk through the little forest and you will reach an Hush AVIA petrol station where nearly all cars go to Germany.\\n\\n=== South and Southeast towards [[Utrecht]], [[Breda]], [[Nijmegen]], [[Arnhem]], [[Düsseldorf]], [[Antwerpen]], [[Brussels]], [[Paris]] ===\\nYou can either go and hitch from the same spot as for going West at the ''Amstel Station'', or hitch from where the motorway to Utrecht starts, which is called the ''Utrechtsebrug''. This second option definitely gives you more cars going into the right direction and generally a lot less waiting time.\\n\\n====Option 1a, Rijnstraat====\\n{{Coords|52.3405|4.9072}}<br>\\nHead to the ''Martin Luther King Park'' in ''Amsterdam Zuid'' where the motorway to A2-motorway starts, which leads to [[Utrecht]] and further to [[Den Bosch]], [[Eindhoven]] and [[Maastricht]]. Take tram 4 or 12 and walk from the ''Vrijheidslaan'' south through the ''Rijnstraat'' to the motorway A10 / A2. At the end of this road before the crossing, you'll find traffic lights where you can pro-actively ask drivers to drop you at the massive ''Haarrijn'' service station (see below). The best traffic lights to pick, as there are three sets here, is the one on your left side when you are standing facing the bridge.\\n\\n====Option 1b, Gas station {{Anl|2}}====\\n{{Coords|52.3323|4.9122}}<br>\\nJust 2km further than option 1a, but this one is only acceseble by car.<br>\\nNOTE: Though the spot is generally awesome, you are likely to spend hours waiting for cars going as far as [http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verzorgingsplaats_Haarrijn Haarrijn] on Sundays (and probably Saturdays too). It might be reasonable to try further spots to avoid local traffic during the end of week.\\n\\n====Option 2, Utrecht on ramp====\\n{{Coords|52.3369|4.8579}}<br>\\nIf you are too lazy to go that far out of the city, take a bus or metro to the station ''Amstelveenseweg'' and stand on the on ramp there with a ''Utrecht'' sign. There is a wide shoulder and it doesn't usually take more than 10 minutes to get a lift. Once on the highway, hop from rest area to rest area and you wont have any problems arriving at your destination.\\n\\n====Option 3, Haarrijn rest stop====\\n{{Coords|52.1437|5.0011}}<br>\\nJust before [[Utrecht]], after exit 5 (''Breukelen'') and just some kilometres before the ''Utrecht Ring'' you find a big petrol-station called ''Haarrijn''. This is an excellent spot to find drivers for larger distances. Place is 2.5 km from [[Maarssen]] train stop.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking In ==\\nComing from the south there is a petrol station just a couple of kilometres before Amsterdam. There are enough people stopping before going into the city. So get off there when your driver doesn't go where you need to be in Amsterdam and catch easily a ride that goes to the district you want to go - this will save you some bugs and 30-60 minutes getting to the other side of town.\\n\\n== Boats ==\\nIt is very possible to hitchhiking a boat  around the Amsterdam canals. Just sit next to the water and thumb and eventually someone will stop. This is more aimed at sight seeing than getting somewhere specific, but more worth it than paying for the touristy ones.\\n\\n== Public transport ==\\nPublic transport in Amsterdam is very expensive. Most people use a card called ''OV-Chipkaart'' which works with all public transportation in the country, but that you won't have if you don't live in the Netherlands. Thus if you just want to get across the city you're better off using a 1-hour ticket which costs a whopping €3.20. If you don't want to pay that much, here's a little guide to Amsterdam public transportation:\\n* Trams are for the most part a no-go, since you have to climb in the front or in the middle, thus in the sightline of the driver/controller who will look if you're validating your ticket/card. Lines 5, 19 and 24 have newer trams, which don't have an office thingy in the middle like the older ones, so you can just board way in the back and you should be fine.\\n* The metro is very easy to blackride: just go behind someone at the gates (preferably asking them first). Controllers are quite rare. The metro system is quite limited in its coverage but can easily get you to some main spots like Sloterdijk and Amstel Station.\\n* If you're using the train, then use the exact same tactic as with the metro (though you might have more eyes on you...). The train sees more ticket control than the metro though it's still not very frequent, especially not on the Sprinter trains (the single-decker ones).\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n{{Cities Noord-Holland}}\\n{{Cities Netherlands}}\\n\\n[[Category:E35]]\\n[[Category:E19]]\\n[[Category:E22]]\\n[[Category:Route Amsterdam - Berlin]]\\n[[Category:Route Amsterdam - Copenhagen]]\\n[[Category:city's]]\\n[[de:Amsterdam]]\\n[[es:Amsterdam]]\\n[[fr:Amsterdam]]\\n[[tr:Amsterdam]]\",\n",

Just before the river Rio Tamega, one of the two main rivers of Marco de Canaveses, you will have this ''gas station'' {{Coords|41.18695|-8.15549|1}}. You can easily walk to the gas station located in the Avenida dos Bombeiros Voluntarios do Marco, which is about 800 meters (10 min) from the city centre. From the town hall, you walk Northwest, for about 550m, from Rua de Sao Nicolau street towards Rio Tamega until you get a street on your left called Rua Cruz, the last street before you reach a small bridge passing over Avenida dos Bombeiros Voluntarios do Marco.

Tell drivers you are going to Porto through the A4. Many of the cars might be from locals, though many are also going direction Porto. If drivers are going to take the A11 towards Guimaraes, you can ask them leave you at the tolls (portagens) at the entrance of the motorways A4 and A11 (they start in the same place). You can try asking drivers directly when they stop to take the card from the machine. These tolls are located about 10 km from Marco de Canaveses (via the N211).\\nThere is a service station on the A4 before Porto, in Aguas Santas.. \\n\\n==== Option 2: Crossroad near Repsol Gas Station ====\\n\\nThe location of this option is very close (about 1 km walking) to the location of option 1.

Make sure you hitchhike the road going to the left towards the river.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Aveiro]], [[Lisbon]], [[Algarve]] ===\\n\\nThe best way to go South is to go towards [[Porto]] (West) in a first instance, using the Repsol Gas Station mentioned earlier. \\nWhen on the A4 towards Porto, you can be dropped at the gas station Estaçao de Serviço de Aguas Santas, 2 km before the merge with the A3. \\nYou can try to find a lift to a service station south of Porto (Repsol gas station in Gaia, or further south on the A1, Estaçao de Serviço Antuã-Estarreja).

It is usually faster and simpler to go to the A4, like in the previous options, with the road N211. Just 1 or 2 kilometers further east on the A4 you have a big service station.

Minibuses in Antalya can sometimes give you trouble, though. When they notice you stopping a car, minibus drivers might ask your driver not to take you, they might even threaten him/her. As Antalya is the Mecca of tourism in Turkey, many people want to take advantage of tourism and make money. So try to get into the car quickly before minibus drivers notice you.\\n\\n\\n=== North towards [[Istanbul]] and West Toward [[Izmir]] ===\\n\\nThere is a great spot to go direction North ([[Burdur]], [[Istanbul]], [[Ankara]], ...), and West ([[Fethiye]], [[Denizli]], [[Izmir]], [[Mugla]] ...) from Antalya.\\nTake the tramway (Antray) to the terminus stop Fatih. From there you can probably find a place to thumb up to get on the main road. But if you walk something like 45 minutes uphill you can get to a great spot, the big crossroad between road to north and road to east.\\nTo get there cross the big street using the bridge, and walk a bit in the same direction as the tramway was going, you'll pass on your left the tramway depot, continue the same direction and you will pass in front of the zoo entrance. Continue on the same way alongside the zoo, the path is going up. At the end the path end up at the big road. Turn left and walk on the left side of the big road, it's really tight, take extra care with the barbed wire so you don't scratch your backpack, you will pass in font of the huge Atatürk statue with waterfall, take a picture and go on. You will get to a small parking place with a great view on the city and the surrounding, enjoy the view, and continue until the end of the parking place. At the end of it cross the big road, you will find a gate to get inside a forest with benches and tables. Go straight up, there is a small channel, you can cross it with a small bridge, and then you will get to a road. Turn left, you will get to the big crossroads, one to the North and one to the West.\\nThere there is redlights, great place to hitch, and even gas stations.\\n\\nIf you want to go İzmir or Aydın directly, use the road to [[Korkuteli]] & [[Denizli]], even if you are in Olympos or near the sea side. The sea side road is rather slow for traveling. It is very long and cars can't go fast and you will change cars often. In winter, there are virtually no cars at all, except for some slow tractors.\\n\\n\\n=== East towards [[Manavgat]], North east towards [[Konya]] ===\\n\\nOption 1 - Take the T1B tram towards Expo from the center (for example from Ismetpasa). You can get of at Aksu or Kursunlu. From there you can walk a little bit on the D400 to just after the ramp at Aksu. There are some spots that are good, for example by the bus stop called Cerik Cd-17 (but this bus doesn’t leave from the center). There is a parking there where people can stop and take you towards Menavgat. \\n\\nIf you want to go to Konya, the route through Menavgat seems the best. Google maps might tell you to leave the D400 before Menavgat at Tasagil, but for hitchhiking this is probably not preferable. Instead go through Manavgat and get on the D695 to Konya. The D695 also goes through Seydisehir. This seems to be the most common and most trafficked way to go to Konya. \\n\\n\\n\\nOption 2 - Take bus 55 which goes to the airport. Get out at the intersection when it turns right to drive towards the airport, and from here if you walk along the road, you will see traffic lights. After these traffic lights is a good place to stand to get a lift heading east. Any bus going to the airport should work. Just ask around.\\n\\n=== South-West towards [[Olympos]], [[Kaş]] ===\\n\\nIn this direction the hotels and resorts stretch for about 10km, to go this direction you can hitchhike from a big roundabout near Migros Shopping Center with a space for people to stop, which you can reach by walking west from the center, following the signs. If that takes too long, the shuttles stop there ever few minutes.\\n\\nYou can also take any bus going to the bus terminal Sarısu Depolama Merkezi 1. Hop off at the terminal. The main road out is just there, and there's plenty of room for cars to stop.\\n\\nIn winter one hitchhiker had no trouble hitchhiking to Olympos and back. If you are have limited time, there is a regular dolmuş service to Kemer, about 30 or 40 kilometres along the coast. It took one hitchhiker about an hour or more to get a ride to the other side of that stretch, but it was also really fast for others to find a ride for 3 to Kemer.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[[Category:Antalya (Province)|Antalya (Province)]]\\n[[Category:E87]]\\n[[Category:D400 (Turkey)]]\",\n",

You have to go under a tunnel before getting out to the ramp. Although it\\'s easy for cars to stop here, it\\'s illegal and dangerous to walk trough the tunnel. A safer and still good stop to start is just before the tunnel.\\n\\n====Option 2====\\nA better option is to hitchhike at the \\'\\'Waaslandtunnel\\'\\'. Often called by locals the \\'\\'Konijnenpijp\\'\\'. There is much room because of the bus stop and cars drive slowly because of the nearby traffic lights. Many drivers go direction Gent\\n\\n====Option 3====\\n{{Coords|51.1937|4.4006}}<br>\\nTake a tram in the city centre. Tram 2 direction Hoboken or tram 6 direction \\'\\'Olympiade\\'\\'. Get off at the stop called \\'\\'De Singel\\'\\'. Right where you get out of the tram you find the ramp for the motorway. There is plenty of space for yourself and cars to pull over. I use this spot frequently and never waited more then 7 minutes for a ride to Gent. A sign could be helpful. Before Gent there are 2 petrol stations coming up if you need longer rides to for example Paris. The first one is \\'\\'Kruibeke\\'\\'{{Coords|51.185017777790286|4.289354398413835|1}} and the second is \\'\\'Kalken\\'\\'{{Coords|51.07155181607695|3.920303837886816|1}}.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Brussels]], [[Luxembourg]] ===\\n====Option 1====\\n{{Coords|51.2077|4.4410}}<br>\\nGet a train or some other form of public transport towards \\'\\'Oost Station\\'\\'. When you leave the station, walk under the train bridge, walk straight down to the signs for Brussels. Here, you should stand after the traffic lights and in a position that you get the attention of cars coming from the two different sections of the junction.\\n\\n====Option 2====\\nTake a tram/bus to \\'\\'Stenenburg\\'\\' stop - any of 21, 24, 242, 420, 421, 422, 423, 429. Once you get off there, turn left and go under the bridge. After you cross the bridge, turn right and keep going straight on, until you see signs of Brussels. After a while you will notice a motorway on your left going in direction of Brussels. Go until the traffic lights and cross them twice following the road signs. You will notice a good interstate, with an emergency line, where you get your rides very fast\\n\\n=== East/northeast towards [[Liège]], [[Eindhoven]] ===\\n====Option 1====\\n{{Coords|51.2157|4.4473}}<br>\\nTram 10 or several buslines to \\'\\'Borgerhout Turnhoutsepoort\\'\\' hitchhike on bus station or walk northeast over the \\'\\'Turnhoutsebaan\\'\\' for only 250 meters, passing the railway tunnel and crossroads and hitch after the motorway sign, start of the A13/E313, on the bridge over the R1/E19. Later on this highway splits in two highways (A13/E313+A21/E34), so make sure you find a ride in the right direction. A sign could be very useful.\\n\\n\\'\\'Update from May 2023: The road marking on the bridge leading up to the highway changed and there is no way for cars to stop. (The space seen on the photo doesn\\'t exist anymore. There is a concrete barrier now). We tried hitching out from the gas station on the western side of the big traffic light without success.\\'\\'\\n\\n====Option 2====\\n{{Coords|51.2082|4.5477}}<br>\\nTake bus 420 or 421 leaving from \\'\\'Borgerhout Sint-Erasmusziekenhuis\\'\\' to \\'\\'Ranst Kastanjelaan\\'\\' (takes about 20 min). From there walk 2 km north to the \\'\\'Opstapplaats Reizen Lauwers\\'\\' highway stop and gas station. It is a big gas station on the E313 with many cars stopping. Finding a hitch here is easy.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Amsterdam]] ===\\n{{Coords|51.2444|4.4287}}<br>\\nTake tram 6 direction \\'\\'Luchtbal\\'\\' and get of at \\'\\'Merksem Lambrechtshoeken\\'\\'. Follow the direction of the tram. You will notice McD. Just behind it, the highway to the Netherlands starts. The traffic is quite sparse but the cars go by slowly. There is plenty of space for you and a car to stop. There is a ring which goes to E19 highway.\\n\\nIf you are heading for Utrecht or Amsterdam, make sure your driver isn\\'t going to [[Bergen op Zoom]]. \\n\\nThere is a massive service station \\'\\'Hazeldonk-Oost\\'\\'{{Coords|51.498627913287706|4.743835317152586|1}}, before Breda, on the Dutch-Belgian border, where it is easy to hitch-hike for example near the exit from the petrol-station. You just have to write a board, because the highway divides into two directions nearby.\\n\\n----\\n\\n=== !!! 2022/07 !!! ===\\nThis entrance to the highway is closed off! An alternative place would be to take the tram to Q Easy petrol station in Schoten! This is one highway entrance further than the one in Merksem, definite plus side is that it\\'s past where the highway splits into direction Utrecht/Amsterdam and Bergen-op-Zoom meaning you can\\'t accidentally end up going to the latter :)\\n\\n\\n=== Most directions ===\\n[[File:Erga hitchhiking from Antwerpen to Paris.jpg|thumb|348px|right|Hitchhiking towards [[Paris]], on-ramp of the Luitenant Lippenslaan]]\\n\\n\\nMotorway at the \\'\\'Luitenant Lippenslaan\\'\\' (a continuation of the \\'\\'Plantin en Moretuslei\\'\\'), the on-ramps there are good for heading to Gent, Paris, Brussels, the west of the Netherlands and possibly more directions.  Make sure to make a [[signs|sign]] as people can go many directions. Nearby metro stops include \\'Draakplaats\\' and \\'De Roma\\'.\\n\\n(January 2023 edit) Alternative for those who prefer starting at gas station - east and maybe west/to the UK.\\n\\nTake bus 420 (Herentals) or 421 from Berchem Station, to Ranst Kastanjelaan, and walk 2 km/2.4 km to the service station \"Ranst\". Note: I\\'ve only tried this going east, no fence to climb! Uncertain about going west. It\\'s very possible to get a ride very far from here, as a lot of people stop here. A sign is recommended since the highway splits.\\n\\nThe bus costs 2.50 €, and you can pay with card on the bus. Not cash unfortunately. You can only buy a ten trip ticket (17€ for 10 trips) at most places who sells ticket. The tickets work for an hour on all De Lijn transport, and works for three years apparently. It should be possible to buy a ticket online as well.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n{{Cities Belgium}}\\n\\n[[Category:Antwerpen (province)| ]]\\n[[Category:E17]]\\n{{IsIn|Antwerpen (province)}}\\n<p>',\n",

A dilapidated former Soviet resort town, this city is a post-apocalyptic re-imagining of every beach town stereotype.\\n\\nIt\\'s actually possible to walk the whole distance through town, which is not that much. Nevertheless, hitchhiking even in the city center is possible, though there might be some private taxi\\'s in between. \\n\\n== Hitching out ==\\n\\n=== North towards [[Pitsunda]], [[Gagra]], [[Russia]]===\\nTake a mini bus, taxi, trolley bus or walk towards the central train station. Next to it, you\\'ll find the main road leading northwards. Just hitchhike along the road or walk about 1 km up, where you can find a petrol station. But probably you will get a ride before you move a foot.\\n\\n===South towards [[Ochamchira]], [[Gali]] ===\\n==== Option 1 (from inside the city) ====\\nGet yourself to the main road close to the city center. This road, \\'\\'Lakoba Street\\'\\' (ул. Лакоба), is where most foreigners have to obtain their visa (house #21). Walk southwards a few meters until you cross a bridge. Another 500m further is a sort of roundabout located with some shops and a stop for local mini busses. You can also take a minibus towards this stop, just stop them along Lakoba street. Just behind that bus stop it\\'s a perfect spot to hitchhike southwards out of town. Try to get a ride at least towards the next GAI (police post), which is just a few kilometers further. Inbetween, the road is extremely narrow  and people tend to drive very fast, it might be uncomfortable for the hitchhiker to stop cars there, though people might stop for you anyway.\\n\\n==== Option 2 (outside the city) ====\\nTake the trolleybus in direction south out of the city. The very last station makes a good hitchhiking spot at the main road. The bus goes quite far out of the city and costs only 3 Ruble.\\n\\n== Accommodation and Sleep ==\\nAbkhaz people are very hospitable in general. Next to that, pitching a tent in the outskirts or at the beach is possible, but it\\'s unlikely you find a spot to hide good enough. Entering the local park (botanic garden) is not free. For a good, somewhat more silent beach, just hitchhike out of town for a few kilometers to the next village southwards. The road passes nearly next to the beach there, where you can find somewhat more silence at night. If nothing helps, many people also rent private rooms, a good indicator is 250-300 Rouble within Sukhum per person/night (August 2011). \\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n[[Category:Abkhazia]]\\n{{IsIn|Abkhazia}}\\n__NOTOC__',\n",

The parking may or may not be open, but either way it would be a bad place to get dropped of at.\\n\\n====Option 1====\\n{{Coords|51.9788|5.9711}}<br>\\nOne good option is a petrol station on the ''IJsseloordweg'' {{Nnl|325}}, in the south-east of town. From the city centre the walk can be long, but bus number 5 will take you close. Walking there is impossible, but getting a lift for the last bit was easy for user Soccie.) The traffic there is busy, and much of it will be going directly to Germany via the A12. It is also possible to stand at the entrance to the station with a sign to get people to turn into the station.\\n\\n\\n====Option 2====\\n{{Coords|52.0037|5.9224}}<br>\\nThe Total petrol station on the north side of the city (see above) on the ''Apeldoornseweg'' is also usefull for heading toward the {{Anl|12}}.\\n\\n====Option 3====\\n{{Coords|51.9844|5.9789}}<br>\\nThere is a petrol station in the south of [[Velp]], 100 metres away from the ''Velperbroek'' roundabout (the junction of the A12 and A348 motorways).\\n\\n=== South: {{Anl|325}} {{Anl|15}} {{Anl|50}} ([[Nijmegen]], [[Eindhoven]], [[Rotterdam]]) ===\\nBe sure to study the routes of motorways in the Arnhem-Nijmegen area before you leave as they can be tricky to navigate when hitching. There are many intersections and not that many service stations in this region. If you're headed to Eindhoven or Rotterdam, you'll have to go toward [[Nijmegen]] first. \\n\\n====Option 1====\\n{{Coords|51.9688|5.8905}}<br>\\nA good starting point is a BP petrol station on the Eldenseweg (on the south bank of the Rhine river). This station is a few turns away from the minor motorway {{Anl|325}} toward Nijmegen. Use this station as a stepping stone to get to the A325. Not many people will be headed further away than Nijmegen. To get to the BP service area from the Arnhem railway station, take trolley 7 toward Rijkerswoerd or buses 31 (Weezenhof) or 36 (Heteren) and get out at 'Transferium'. Turn back the way the bus came and cross the big intersection, but watch out, as there are no pedestrian crossings here. Be advised that bus stop 'Fonteinstraat' is actually closer to the BP pump, but is seperated from the buslane by a busy road with a guardrail in the middle.\\n\\n====Option 2 ====\\n{{Coords|51.9315|5.8765}}<br>\\nA few kilometers down the A325 you will find a Shell station called ''Kempke'' where more long distance drivers make a stop. You will have to hitch here from the above mentioned station, as it is nearly impossible to get here any other way.\\nFrom ''Kempke'' you should only accept rides that take you past the many intersections in this area. For direction Rotterdam that should be service station ''Varakker'' on the {{Anl|15}}. For direction [[Eindhoven]] and [[Den Bosch]] this should be ''Ganzenven'' on the {{Anl|50}}.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n{{Cities Netherlands}}\\n{{Cities Gelderland}}\\n[[Category:City's]]\\n[[Category:Gelderland]]\\n[[Category:E35]]\",\n",

Although it\\'s located in a rather conservative region of the United States, Asheville stands out as a very diverse and open city. In the city one can find your typical southerners wearing flannel shirts, trucker hats, and work boots, wealthy professionals, a rather strong anarchist subculture, hip-hoppers, hipsters, street performers, among other groups of people. There are many local breweries which produce beer quality enough to rival many in Belgium or Germany.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\nDowntown Asheville is rather isolated from most exits to the highway; however, hitchhiking is very common even from the downtown to the outer parts of the city limits. Just point yourself in a direction and put out the thumb.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'East Toward Charlotte\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nBus 170 or E2 from the ART center in downtown will take you to a nice on-ramp to I 40 in East Asheville for $1. Ask to be left at the VA center (not the hospital) or Go Grocery. Hitch at the traffic light  or on the shoulder.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'South Toward Greenville/Spartanburg/Atlanta\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nTake bus w2 and get off at the stop in front of Hampton inn on Brevard road. Cross the street and hitch at the on ramp to I26 or walk .2 miles west to the Citgo and ask people. The wait won\\'t be long. Follow 26 to Spartanburg or take 25 to get to Greenville and Atlanta. If you are continuing south, Try to find someone going to at least the junction with I85 in Traveler\\'s Rest South Carolina (where there are many big gas stations). This is where everyone refuels as South Carolina has the cheapest gas in America. Even better, is to continue onto I85 and have them leave you at the Pilot Station at exit ? 31? Just a few miles down the road outside of Piedmont, SC. Their you can find car and truck traffic to any point south. Beware, though, that Pilot has a policy against hitchhikers. It is not heavily enforced, but you may be asked to leAve if you are too conspicuous.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'West Towards Knoxville/Nashville\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nExit 44 at the junctions of I40 and road 74 is probably the best spot, as there\\'s plenty of space for cars to pull over. Many of them are offering short rides though as theis is also the road towards towns in Great Smoky Mountains. I waited about two hours for a car to Knoxville, but I rejected 4 or 5 short rides as I didn\\'t want to get stuck.\\n\\n== Hitching In ==\\n\\nMost exits around Asheville are still about five miles from the downtown. But, as stated above, hitching is common in and around the town so people are likely to pick you up from there as well and take you into downtown or wherever you need to go.\\n\\nFrom southwest i85 and Atlanta\\n\\nNorth Carolina is a hub for migrant farm workers. Look for them at any exit from Texas to South Carolina and you have a chance to get a ride. They often work in the piedmont area (further east) so ask them to leave you at the cross of 85 north and 26 west in Spartanburg. There are two gas stations at the first exit on 26 heading west and most people stopping there are heading through Asheville and beyond. Though people are conservative in this area and unused to hitchhiking, they are often very friendly and curious. Owen approached two young guys at this gas station. Though they were local from Spartanburg, they drove him to Asheville because they had \\'nothing better to do\\' and treated him to beer.\\n\\n== Places to Avoid ==\\n\\n== Accommodation and Sleep ==\\n<!---\\nWild camping places are good.   Please don\\'t add regular hostels.  \\n-->\\n\\nThere is a nice park near UNCA where you won\\'t be bothered in North Asheville off of Merrimon. Down in the river arts district there are many abandoned buildings and factories. \\n\\nWarren Wilson College\\n\\nIf you take bus 170 to Warren Wilson College, there are forests and hiking trails very close to the campus where camping is allowed. There are even some treehouses and abandoned houses there. The students are friendly to travelers and are able to procure food for you from the cafeteria at no cost to them (tell them to use their \\'flex dollars\\' or to get a to- go plate from glad). There is free wifi in all buildings.  Be wary of sleeping in dorms and common areas because security or staff will ID you after a few days and kick you off campus. There are work crews on campus such as the garden, farm, and landscaping crews which might appreciate volunteers, if you want something to do.\\n\\nThere is also food not bombs every week in Pritchard park.\\n\\n== Personal Experiences ==\\n\\nIn one case, Eripson was merely walking on the road (no thumb) and a man offered to give him a ride from a far away West Asheville exit off I-40 all the way into downtown.\\n\\nOwen had a similar experience. You can hitchhike anywhere in town. Suburu\\'s are your best bet. Be friendly and praise Asheville.\\n\\n== Other Useful Info ==\\n\\nA good place to loiter without them kicking you out is the Firestorm Cafe and Bookstore. They have many independent publications regarding poetry, short fiction, anarchism, and various other social topics. The primarily vegan food is overpriced, the coffee is fair trade (therefore expensive), but the music and movie showings in the evenings are free of charge.\\n\\nTrainhopping is also very easy from this town. The train is slow all through south Asheville and hoop able, and stops in the river arts district and west Asheville. Ask any of the traveler kids in Pritchard park or firestorm if you need tips! \\n{{IsIn|North Carolina}}\\n__NOTOC__\\n\\n[[Category:North Carolina]]\\n[[trash:Asheville]]',\n",

It is the center of one of the most multicultural regions in the country, having more than 5 indigenous peoples and many more immigrant communities. You can find Orthodox, Catholic, Protestant churches, Islamic mosques and Buddhist temples in and around the city. It\\'s also notable for its architecture, the Kremlin and old wooden houses.\\n\\nNote that it\\'s located in a semidesert area with a very dry climate and probably the hottest summers in Russia. Be aware of huge amounts of mosquitoes, especially in June.\\n\\n== Hitching Out ==\\n=== North towards [[Volgograd]], [[Moscow]] ===\\nThere are two options to start hitchhiking towards Volgograd (which you have to reach first if you are going to [[Moscow]], [[Saint Petersburg]] or [[Voronezh]]). They correspond to two roads which go on the left and the right banks of Volga respectively. The river is very wide, there is a lot of islands in it, and there are no bridges outside the city, so you have to choose a road when you are still there and you won\\'t be able to change it.\\n\\nThe first option (the left bank) is to take a local train from the main railway station to the north. All of them go along the road which connects Astrakhan to Volgograd trough towns of Kharabali and Akhtubinsk. Feel free to leave the train whereever you want after you pass Astrakhan II station and before you reach 1512 km (inclusively). 1512 km might be the best option as there is a shop and a petrol station just 500 meters away from the place where the train stops. A train ticket will cost between €1 and €2 and it will take no more than 40 minutes to get to the needed station.\\n\\nThis road is a bit longer than the right bank one but it\\'s easier to reach from Astrakhan city center and it will also bring you to the downtown of Volgograd.\\n\\nThe right bank way is just a bit shorter and there is slightly more traffic there, as it\\'s preferred by truck drivers. However, the pavement quality is really bad and there are less sights on this side. It will only bring you to the southernmost Volgograd suburbs which are pretty far away from the city center and the road to Moscow. To use this way, you have to take marshrutka (minibus) № 113 from the main railway station (bus stop near the petrol station on the right hand) to Streletskoye. It\\'s a 35-50 minutes ride for which you pay around 30 Eurocents. You can also take a bus to the town of Narimanov. They depart from the small regional bus terminal located right on the territory of the main railway station. The ride will last around an hour, you\\'ll pay €1 to €2 but there you\\'ll face less local traffic.\\n\\n{{IsIn|Russia}}\\n\\n[[Category:Russia]]\\n\\n[[ru:Астрахань]]',\n",

It is a calm city, with a gritter edge than [[Argentina]], and safer than [[Brazil]] in cities. \\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== North towards [[Filadelfia]] ===\\nGet on a #5 bus that heads out towards Villa Hayes. It is likely that you will have to take a bus from the centre to Ruta Transchaco to get this, for example Linea 24 or just ask about. #5 goes out to Villa Hayes. Alternatively, ask for any buses \\'\\'que crucen la puente\\'\\', the only bridge over to the Chaco. You can hitchhike from the roundabout 1km after the bridge, or stay on the #5 and it will keep going along the route. At Benjamin Aceval (some 5\\'s go as far as here, ask), there is a peaje, and the police is cool about you hitchhiking here. If you get here late, you can camp safely nearby.\\n\\n=== West towards [[Salta]] or [[Jujuy]] ([[Argentina]]) ===\\nProceed as described above, turning south at the roundabout after the brige. Alternatively, on Ruta Transchaco, get a bus towards Puerto Falcón (it should say \"Falcón\" as a destination), walk across the border and hitch a ride towards Formosa (it seems that RN81 in Argentina gets way more traffic than RN86 directly from Clorinda).\\n\\n=== South towards [[Encarnacion]] ===\\nPick up bus #18, which runs close to the bus station and from various points, or bus #85, which stops right in front of Paseo La Galería shopping center on Avenida Santa Teresa, as it heads south. Guarambare is what you should ask for, or whether they go along Acesso Sur. It is a 40-50 minute run out of the city. Get out if you see a good spot, or if the bus pulls off the main highway. Trucks use this route into the city and there are a lot of warehouses.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking in ==\\n=== From [[Ciudad del Este]] ===\\nWalk to the west, away from the crowd that enters the city to go shopping. Most of the people who enter the city go back to Brasil at the end of the day. There\\'s only one road to Asuncion, so have a little patience to meet somebody traveling to the capital.

You have either the chance to ask drivers directly at the service station, or walk uphill nearly 500m to the end of the service station. There's a good spot where all little ways from the parking areas meet to bring drivers back to the motorway. You'll also have a great view over the villages. See the image.\\n\\n=== Direction [[Bielefeld]], [[Dortmund]] ===\\nMost drivers stopping here might go towards [[Bielefeld]] or further into the [[Ruhr Area]], passing [[Dortmund]]. So if you go further along the [[A2 (Germany)|A2]], you might find a ride within no more than 10-15 minutes.\\n\\n=== Direction [[Osnabrück]], [[Netherlands]] ([[Amsterdam]]) ===\\nIf you want to go towards Osnabrück or further towards Amsterdam along the [[A30 (Germany)|A30]], you have to get out at this service station if drivers are not going your way anyway. Since most traffic is not going towards the A30, you can look forward for some 30-40 minutes waiting time until somebody might go your direction. Try to get rides towards [[Bad Oeynhausen]], there you can find service stations along the city-motorway where you even can find Dutch cars. Next service station will be [[Grönegau West]], just before [[Melle]] and [[Osnabrück]]. \\n\\n<gallery>\\nImage:Auetal a2.jpg|Nice spot at the end of the station\\n</gallery>\\n\\n[[Category:Gas stations]]\\n[[Category:E30]]\\n\\n[[de:Auetal Nord]]\",\n",

Walk back and make a right. You walk towards a big crossroads now. Turn left at the crossroad (the footpath is a bit hidden on the other side of the crossing) and follow the big street until it makes a right. (Note for re-visting hitchhikers: there was a gas station here before but it\\'s closed now.) When the street makes a right just cross it to the other side and follow the street for about 50-100 meters until you see a path on your left hand side. After around 300 meters the path ends and you can stop cars which all go to the [[A8 (Germany)|A8]].\\n\\n=== West towards [[Ulm]], [[Stuttgart]] {{Autobahn|8}} {{European Route Number|52}} ===\\nOption 1: Like going eastwards, see options 1 and 3 above\\n\\nOption 2: Take bus line 22 or 23 to \\'\\'Firnhaberau Endstation\\'\\', then walk 15-20 minutes north to rest station \\'\\'[[:de:Augsburg Ost|Augsburg Ost]]\\'\\'.\\n:To get to the rest station turn left on \\'\\'Siedlerweg\\'\\' after getting off the bus.

When the path splits, take the first right, then left when it dead ends into another path. When you get to the pavement street, go left and you\\'ll cross a bridge over the motorway. You can see the rest station on your right. After you cross the bridge, take the first right on the bike path, then the second side path on your right, and there you are. There is a less complicated way to get there, but this ist the fastest. Note that the rest station only works for the westward direction.\\n\\nNote: The On-ramp \\'\\'Augsburg-West\\'\\' is not useful anymore because of the approach road that connects the motorway with the B17.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Landsberg]], [[Füssen]] (B17) ===\\nOption 1: Take bus line 32 and get off at \"Dayton-Ring\".

The university has more than 20.000 students that mostly come from the surrounding area. On Thursday afternoons/evening and Friday early afternoon you can find many young people giving you lifts to the surrounding area or the next gas station.\\nYou can reach the university by taking tram line 3 to \"Universität\". Get off there and walk to the north and the west side of the university. It is a little up the hill, where you find the parking lots.\\nNote that the university only works in winter and summer, while having long vacations in spring (around February till April) and autumn (August till October). \\n\\n== Hitchhiking In ==\\n\\nIf you are entering from south (B17 highway) you can get off at any highway exit after the football stadium (you can easily spot it on your left side) and walk 3min eastwards to a tram station of tram line 3.\\nIf you are coming from north, east or west (Munich, Ulm, ...) your driver can get you off at a highway exit in the north of Augsburg and you can walk around one 1km south to the station \"P+R Oberhausen Nord\" of tram line 4.\\n\\nFor Entering from Munich, ask to get off at the very first highway exit after crossing the river Lech (the bridge right when you enter the city). If you are coming from west (Ulm, Stuttgart, ...), ask your driver to switch the highway to highway B17 in south direction (Universität, Landsberg, CityCenter, ...) at the big highway crossing \"Kreuz Augsburg West\". Take the very first exit on B17, after 500m you have reached the Park&Ride tram station \"P+R Oberhausen Nord\" of tram line 4.\\n\\n== Black Driving ==\\nEverybody can use any tram line for one stop, if starting from Königsplatz (the central tram station, in the middle of the city) for free(!). If you want to go further, you can get in the trams, without any control or stop. They have civilian conductor teams (usually three people, sometimes two). These teams are at least 25 and not more than 50 years old. Most of them are male and usually they stand together in a group at the tram station, but then splitting up in the tram (one goes to the end, one in the middle, one to the front). However i study in Augsburg for 7 years and wasn\\'t checked more than 20times in total and always around the city center.\\nIn buses you need to get in at the front door, but you can go through the back door, if somebody gets out. If you go in the front, they want to see your ticket. All students, many pupils and a lot more people have longtime tickets in their wallets. They show them usually very quickly to the bus driver, that they can\\'t recognize anything. So all you need to do is, quickly showing them a rather white card (7cmx4cm) in your wallet and pass selfsufficiently. \\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n[[Category:Germany]]\\n[[Category:Bavaria|Bavaria]]\\n[[Category:E52]]\\n[[de:Augsburg]]',\n",

There are many marinas that are open to the public, full of generous well-to-do cruisers and yachties. The sailing community is built around friendly interaction between boats too, so if you get a ride on one sailboat you might end up meeting the next one through them without even trying. \\n\\nPublic transit between the islands is limited, but every major town should at least have a roughly-weekly mail boat (small cargo ship) going between there and Nassau.

If you make friends with them, they can be helpful in finding you a lift.\\n\\nIt may be extremely easy to hitch in mainland Mexico, but in the Baja California peninsula, it\\'s a completely different story! ([[User:Zenit|Zenit]] disagrees, see below.) Saying this, it is completely do-able! In Baja California, there is only one road, the HWY 1, which isn\\'t hell to hitchhike on but requires a lot of patience: there are often large distances in between cities (which are barely even cities, rather a few ranches and cactus farms) and even larger distances between petrol stations (example: El Rosario is the last one before Guerrero Negro, about 360 km further down in Baja California Sur). Getting stuck in the middle of the desert is NOT fun, and many people can only take you from town to town as it is local traffic or gringos doing one of the many races down in the Baja. Also, unless you are planning on staying in Baja and going back up towards the USA-Mexico border, you should hitchhike from Mexicali south. \\n\\n== Experiences ==\\n*[[User:El Chulito|El Chulito]] and [[User:Shamcore|Shamcore]] hitch-hiked through whole [[Baja California]] in August 2016, staying on the beaches and local people’s homes. Thumbing experience is more than positive. Don’t miss this part of [[Mexico]], it’s people and nature will drive you crazy. Hitch-hiking through this state is highly recommendable and, to tell the truth, not that hard as you may think.<br>To better understand what does hitch-hiking in this area look like, let’s divide the state in three parts:\\n\\n:*\\'\\'\\'The route from [[Tijuana]] to [[El Rosario]].\\'\\'\\'<br>The first part is quite easy to hitch-hike, you won’t probably even notice the difference with thumbing in the mainland. There’s no problem if you want to wild camp and stay safe. Supermarkets like Bodega Aurera and Climax are widespread, you will find them in [[Ensenada]], [[Monadero]] and [[San Quintin]].\\n\\n:*\\'\\'\\'The route from [[El Rosario]] towards [[Guerrero Negro]] and [[Baja California Sur]]\\'\\'\\'<br>The second part may be a bit more complicated due to low traffic. Expect some longer waiting times. Usually one of 15 cars picks you up, but note that sometimes you’ll have to wait for 10-15 minutes for a car to appear. Bring enough water with you.\\n\\n:*\\'\\'\\'The route from [[Mexicali]] to [[Punta Prieta]] through [[San Felipe]].\\'\\'\\'<br>\\nThe third part is an alternative way to get from the north to [[Punta Prieta]]. This is mostly a dirt road, which has less traffic than the main road MEX1. If you have any experience in hitch-hiking this road, share it here.\\n\\n*[[User:Zenit|Zenit]] hitched down from Tijuana to La Paz in late December 2017 with a female friend, and the hitching was extremely easy -- the longest wait between the two cities was about half an hour, but often it only took a few minutes to get long rides.

It borders the state of [[Baja California]] to the north. Baja California Sur is the least densely populated of all Mexican states. Its capital and most important city is [[La Paz (Baja California Sur)|La Paz]], which has a (quite expensive) ferry connecting the state with the ports in [[Mazatlán]] and [[Los Mochis]] in [[Sinaloa]]. [[Cabo San Lucas]] at the southern tip is popular with foreign tourists.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking ==\\nHitchhiking in Baja California Sur is definitely possible. However, you should be aware that it lies in a desert climate zone and protect yourself accordingly. The low population density means that comparatively few cars pass by and hitchhiking is best done on the main highway connecting all major settlements in the state. Hitchhiking on the other roads is also possible, but usually with long waiting times.\\n\\nBaja California Sur lies on a popular drug smuggling route to the [[United States of America|US]], which means there are many military checkpoints on the main highway. They are often very helpful to hitchhikers and will talk to drivers to take you with them.\\n\\nIf you plan on heading to mainland Mexico from the Baja, you can take a ferry in La Paz (Pichilingue) towards Mazatlán or Topolobampo. From La Paz to Topolobampo costs $970 MXN (approx. $53 USD) and to Mazatlan costs $1102 MXN (approx. $60 USD) (June 2016). See the  [http://en.bajaferries.com.mx/ BajaFerries website] for the latest prices. It is also possible to hitchhike a private yacht: [[User:Chael777|Chael777]] managed to [[hitchhiking a sailboat|hitchhike a sailboat]] from La Paz to Mazatlán.\\n\\n== August 2016 experience: ==\\n[[User:El Chulito|El Chulito]] and [[User:Shamcore|Shamcore]] hitch-hiked several places in [[Baja California]], spending a bit more than a month staying on the beaches and local people’s homes. Thumbing experience is more than positive. Don’t miss this part of [[Mexico]], it’s people and nature will drive you crazy. Hitch-hiking through this state is highly recomendable. \\n\\n== Camping on the beach ==\\nIt is a common practice to camp on beaches in Baja California Sur. Mexican themselves consider it safe however it might be interesting to check with the local population before doing so (it is dangerous on the other side of the gulf for example). Some of them might be privatized by hotels and resorts but it is quite easy to find another spot a bit further. The tide has little effect on the Californian Gulf coast so camping is also doable on small beaches like in La Paz.\\n\\n===Playa del Amor===\\nThe Lovers’ Beach is a hidden cove near Cabo San Lucas, at the southernmost tip of the Baja California peninsula.

From there walk north along the road (although signs for Astara will point you other way, but do not mind - they are stupid to navigate the traffic in a strange way) for a kilometer until you hit a big crossing. You can hitchhike on a junction to M3 where there is plenty of space to stop. If you are hitchhiking to Ganja it is better to use this M3 and then M2 instead of M4. If I am not mistaken, bus number 3 or 33 was going near Kempinsky from the center. Ask around to make sure!\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nFrom the center neer Nizami Park, take the bus 31 at Sabunchu bus stop to Dövlat İmtahan Mərkəzi.

If you just walk on for some 600 meters or so, you\\'ll come to an on-ramp to the road going towards both Shamakhi and Sumgayit\\n\\n\\n== [[Hitchhiking a boat|Ferries]] ==\\n\\n=== To [[Turkmenistan]] ===\\n\\nThere is an irregular ferry to Turkmenistan crossing the Caspian Sea. There is no schedule for this ferry and it is not sure if it can be [[hitchhiking|hitchhiked]], but it is supposed to depart Baku much more often than the Aktau ferry, perhaps every 3-4 days.\\n\\n=== To [[Kazakhstan]] ===\\n\\nThere is an irregular cargo ship which accepts passengers to Kazakhstan crossing the Caspian Sea. There is no real schedule for this ship, but it usually leaves Baku every 1-8 days. \\n\\nSomeone travelled in this ferry for free on the same date, so it is actually possible to hitchhike the trip. Still, it is not advisable unless you really haven\\'t enough money to buy a ticket, because getting into the ship without one is an extremely difficult endeavor and, in case you are finally refused the entry, you will probably have to wait 10 days or more until the next ferry comes.\\n\\nIf you are determined to attempt to hitchhike the ship, there\\'s also some advice that might help you to succeed. \\nFirst of all, you should be aware that you will be asked for a ticket at three different places: the entrance of the port (by policeman), the entrance of the customs office (where you\\'ll get the Azerbaijan passport stamps) and inside the ferry. Bribing could probably get you through the two first controls, but it is much easier to just befriend the policemen of the port in order to do so. After that, you will finally arrive at the ferry, which ought to be the hardest part of your adventure. If you declare that you have no ticket outright, you will be immediately kicked off the ship, so your best option is to stall with some excuse in order to attempt to speak directly with the captain, who\\'s the only one who might take you aboard without a ticket. Once you\\'ve managed to stay on board after departure, the rest of the trip should be easy, because it is unlikely that you would encounter any serious problems at the Kazakhstan border. Enjoy your ride!\\n\\n\\n== Food ==\\n\\nThere\\'s a mall called \\'\\'Park Bulvar\\'\\' on the waterfront. The food court has the probably best table-diving in all of the Caucasus.

Your best bet is to take bus #3 from the library to the outlet center on the West side of town.\\n\\nRumors of a trallace enabling campers to set up on the roof of the old outlet center (furthest from the freeway) are false as of 05/2019.

Go left at the little steps, which lead to a road underneath the tracks, then straight. Turn right at the main road, then continues on the road \\'\\'Hohenrainstrasse\\'\\'. Follow this road for 5 minutes, keep on the left footpath, and you will then see a small commercial area. Turn left onto this street , \\'\\'Zurlindenstrasse\\'\\', walk down until you reach a little forest with a path going down. Follow the path.

The second last stop (\"Frachthalle\") arrives at the St.Louis area which is beside the Swiss-French border. You will see that there is a police check point for cars. If you make your way to this area and stand at the side you should be able to interact with vehicles’ at a very slow speed. Look out for the police as they can be a nuisance but I had no problems.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can walk straight down through St. Louis, or take the bus, down to the other end of town. Eventually, you will be at a small petrol station. Not exactly the best place, but there is a round-about that leads straight to the A35. There is only a small parking space for vehicles to stop, so not so ideal for trucks, however when I was hitchhiking there, there was heavy traffic coming from all directions and vehicles had to slow down as they turned. I only stood there for about 20-30mins. I found the atmosphere a lot nicer than around the border patrol. (On googlemaps: 47.59372,7.555225)\\n\\nYou can also take the bus number 50 to \"Friedrich-Miescher-Strasse\" and walk down the hill. There you\\'ll find the [[slip road]] for the motorway to France. In the morning and especially in the evening there is a lot of traffic. And just next to it, you find a colorful squat, where you can probably find a sleeping place for a night, if hitchhiking just doesn\\'t work.

You see a bridge leading over the railway lines. Cross the bridge and walk straight ahead till there is a second street turning right. Just follow this road to the rest area! (You can see it soon so it’s impossible you don’t find it!)\\n\\n*Update (11-Aug-2014): If you want to try hitchhiking directly out of the city, walk from the trainstation Basel SBB (exit city) towards the tramstops. Once you reach the busy street (Nauenstrasse) turn to the right and follow this street. This street leads towards the highway entry, so you can start thumbing once you walked past a big bridge that goes to the right (Münchensteinerstrasse).

Compared to the exit \\'\\'Bayreuth Süd\\'\\', it is a lot easier for the cars to stop for you and there is even a petrol station close to the exit with the possibility to ask people directly. For getting there you take the Bus Nr. 1 towards Laineck. It leaves approximately every 20 minutes either from ZOH or the main train station. Get off at \\'\\'Königsbergstraße\\'\\' and head 100 meters towards the Autobahn. Take either the Esso Petrol station there or try your luck with the cars passing and stopping at the [[traffic light hitchhiking|traffic lights]]. Take a sign, as there are several possibilities to go. Another option (if heading north) is after the big roundabout straight at the highway ramp. Cars are not going too fast (due to the roundabout), they can see you there is enough space to stop and you will not get into trouble as long as you stand before the sign marking the start of the highway. To get there take the same bus, get off at the train station in Laineck and head North-East through the industrial area until you see the roundabout.\\n\\nOn the ramp \\'\\'Bayreuth Süd\\'\\' there is also a major traffic light were you could flag down cars but no patrol station and very limited space for the cars to stop. Afterwards, straight before the ramp, there are no (legal) possibilities for the cars to stop.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Rest Place Wolfsbach\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nAnother possibility is to get to the small resting area at the A9 in Wolfsbach by bus. From the bus-stop you pass the village towards the motorway and head slightly south towards a tunnel under the motorway. Just before the tunnel, there is a small road to the left passing a railroad bridge and going south along the motorway. Follow that road for about one kilometer. Right after passing a farm building (to the left) there is the resting place to the right. There is no petrol station here, but the people using the toilet will pick you up. There are rest places on both sides of the motorway.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Rest Place/Service Area Fränkische Schweiz-Pegnitz Ost/West\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nThe petrol station in Pegnitz is a good place for people with a \"Deutschlandticket\", “Semesterticket” or someone who is willing to take the train for a bit. You should have no problems getting lifts from here, since there is a restaurant and petrol station. Get the train to Pegnitz (30 min) and from here take buses 311 (->Nürnberg) ,386 (->Betzenstein), 391 (->Gößweinstein) and get off at \"Neudorf West\" (7min). From here head north through the commercial area for 1 km if going south or cross back under the motorway before heading north at its eastern side of you want to hitch North. Getting out at \"Neudorf Ost\" is also possible. \\n\\n=== North and West ([[Kulmbach]], [[Coburg]], [[Bamberg]], [[Schweinfurt]]) ===\\nFrom the city center you can walk the Hindenburgstraße until you cross the Nordring. After the crossing you\\'ll find a busstop. From there many cars go in direction Kulmbach - and some also on the [[A70 (Germany)|A70]] to Bamberg or Schweinfurt (can be better with a sign to this direction), but at least Kulmbach should be easy.\\n\\n[[Category:Bavaria]]\\n[[Category:E51]]\\n[[Category:E48]]\\n[[Category:Germany]]\\n\\n[[de:Bayreuth]]',\n",

Take bus number 980 to the last stop called Miyun (16RMB, Nov 2017). There will be loads of taxis offering to drive you but you can also just walk from the bus station to the road going to Gubeikou. Walk out of the bus station take a right and then a left on the bigger crossing. Here you can either start hitching or walk a bit further till the next traffic light. Around here people will always ask you money so be sure to have a translation of what you are doing. Once you are in Gubeikou you have to pass the police check point and walk for about 200m until you see a street going left towards some neighborhood of Gubeikou. Always walk straight until the road will eventually turn to dirt road. The road ends with a house. The trail starts right before the house to the left. Follow this trail and you will eventually hit the Great Wall. The Trailhead as well as the access point are marked on MAPS.me. You can walk here for about 4km on the wall for free until you will be asked by the ticket officer of the Jinshanling part for your ticket (after having left the wall because of the military zone). You can just walk out and hitch back from Jinshanling to Beijing. (The entire walk is about 10km but very easy walk and beautiful scenery).\\n\\n\\n=== Southwest towards [[Xian]] ===\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Dujiakan roundabout\\'\\'\\': This option costs 3.5 Yuan, it\\'s pretty good and easy to reach. Take the subway line #2 (blue line) to \\'\\'Changchunjie station\\'\\', it costs 2 Yuan. Get out on the north-west exit, cross the road and then walk to the inner lane from the right where you will see plenty of people waiting for the bus! Don\\'t worry, most of them will not go with you on the same bus :). Search for bus #661 or #662 and go aboard. Prepare a paper with the name \\'\\'Dujiakan roundabout\\'\\' in Chinese and show it to the lady whom you are going to pay 1.5 Yuan for the ride. When you get off the bus, you\\'ll find yourself on a parallel street to the highway. Cross this street and on the left turn on the roundabout to the direction of the toll-gate with the blue roof. When you pass it you\\'ll be on the highway. Stand close to the toll gate which is on the highway and you\\'ll have a good spot hitch-hiking from. Having a sign is not a good idea, better wave your hand up and down. (November 2010)\\n\\n\\n=== South towards [[Wuhan]] [[G45 (China)|G45]]===\\n\\nTake the subway to Huangcun Huochezhan (黄村火车站). It\\'s on line 4 (the Daxing line). Walk down Linxiao North Road (林校北路) towards the highway. Once at the highway, turn right and you will see the toll booth. Stand there, somebody will stop for you even though it might look like there\\'s not much space to work with.\\n\\n=== South to [[Shanghai]] [[G2 (China)|G2]] ===\\n\\nG2 highway goes all the way to Shanghai.\\n\\n==== Option 1 ====\\n\\nTake Yizhuang line to Wanyuanjie station (pink line). Go out of tue north east exit, head right(east) towards the highway. You will reach a fenced golf course, you can climb in and across (we even found a breach in the fence) or go around the golf course to reach the toll both. From there you are on G2. Have a note in Chinese explaining who you are, what you are doing and that you want to stay on the high way at gas stations or toll booths. \\n\\n==== Option 2 ====\\n\\nTake the Yizuang line to Tongjinanlu. From there you have to walk southeast along tong ji nan lu (同济南路) for 2,3 km until you reach Xing hua zhong jie (兴华中街) where you have to turn left and follow the road for 600 m. You will see the highway and there is a entrance to go onto a service station with a restaurant and gas station ([39°45′32.12″N 116°33′21.92″E](https://www.google.com/maps?q=39%C2%B045%E2%80%B232.12%E2%80%B3N+116%C2%B033%E2%80%B221.92%E2%80%B3E)). There you can stop cars ask around or if nothing works you can also take a bus from there to everywhere as they are stoping for a break and to pick up and drop off people.

The European route [[E30]] passes through it entering at [[Brest (Belarus)|Brest]] on the border with [[Poland]] and leaving at the [[Russia]]n border between [[Orša]] and [[Smolensk]]. It is a fantastic and easy-going place for hitchhiking and the police or the political system generally will not bother you at all, so once you have your visa (if needed) you can just relax and go for it. You will enjoy!\\n\\n== General information ==\\n72% of the population live in towns and cities, and virtually all the population speaks Russian as their first language. In rural areas a mix of Russian and Belarusian may be spoken. It is therefore better to make destination [[signs]] in Russian when hitchhiking.\\n\\nAlso, there are two versions of the Belarusian flag – the official one is the red-green flag (also jokingly known as “dusk over a swamp”), whereas the one used by the opposition is a three-striped white-red-white flag. For your own safety, it is not advised to demonstrate the latter one in public.\\n\\nFreedom of speech is very restricted in Belarus, try not to ask too many questions about mr. Lukashenko, people might get in trouble when saying something bad about their politics.\\n\\n== Language ==\\nIn big cities, especially Minsk, you can expect young people to speak at least a basic level of English. If you are hitch-hiking to Russia along [[E30]]/[[M1 (Belarus)|M1]], expect some truck drivers to speak Polish as well as Russian.\\n\\nLanguage barrier can cause some troubles since many drivers speak almost exclusively only Russian or \\'\\'Trasianka\\'\\', the mishmash of Belarusian and Russian, therefore learn some basic phrases in Russian before you go there. If you do understand some Russian but you are not familiar with Belarusian culture don\\'t get scared or disappointed hearing many swearing words when drivers talk to you – these words aren\\'t directed to you but are rather a simple hearty expression.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking ==\\n\\nHitchhiking in Belarus is very easy and rarely your waiting time will exceed 15 minutes, at least on the main road M1 from [[Brest]] via [[Minsk]] to [[Moscow]]. As it is very common in Belarus, often drivers may pick you up without being curious about you or what you are doing, sometimes no communication at all. Belarusian people can seem gloomy at first sight, but in the end they are mostly very nice and helpful and drop you on a good spot. In rare cases a small number of older drivers might ask for some money when giving you a ride – to avoid that, tell the driver about your intention to travel for free before you sit into the car (\\'\\'\"Ja puteshestvuju avtostopom, bez deneg\"\\'\\' [\\'\\'\"u\"\\'\\' is pronounced as \\'\\'\"oo\"\\'\\' in English] – \\'\\'\"I travel by hitch-hiking, not paying any money\"\\'\\'). Usually, just saying \\'no money\\' works just fine too. It might be more difficult if you are more than 2 persons travelling together – in such case it would be smart to split up for some time. \\n\\nWhen hitchhiking in Belarus, it is very likely to find some other people standing next to the road, waiting for a car to pick them up. Although most people do not speak English well, it is nice to try to make some contact. Most of them might look angry, but it\\'s just on the outside and once you start talking to them they\\'re just very friendly and warm people. Some Belarusians will even wait for an hour with you in a snowstorm, waiting for another car to stop :) \\n\\nRussian and Baltic truck drivers are reluctant to stop for hitchhikers in Belarus while Belarusian and Polish trucks are happy to have a company of some traveller(s). Hitchhiking at night is difficult but if you make yourself very visible you can get a ride even at two o\\'clock at night (some cars might stop just because a driver thinks you are police – light reflectors might give such an impression).\\n\\nThe average waiting time is about 20 minutes. It’s better to travel using main roads as road traffic on local roads is pretty poor. In Belarus there are no roads with limitations for hitchhikers, you can start stopping a car wherever you like, the only exception is bridges. Roadsides are usually wide enough to stop even a truck. Main roads are in a good condition while roads in rural areas might unpleasantly surprise you. \\n\\n[[File:IMG 20170717 154059.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Light-returning reflectinve band. This little thing can save you about 10€ when you meet the policy at the road]]\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Note\\'\\'\\': In Belarus you have to wear a flicker (light-returning element or reflective band) when you are on the road after sunset. The [[police]] have a plan to get some amount of violators each month, so the possibility of penalty (about € 10) is quite high. It\\'s better to buy a flicker (it costs from € 1), and it\\'s not a problem – now they are sold in any shop in Belarus. And it\\'s [[hitchhiker\\'s safety|a good idea]] to use them anyway when [[hitchhiking at night]].\\n\\n\\n== Maps ==\\n[[File:Ratmir_autostop_Minsk.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Ratmir]] hitching from [[Minsk]] to [[Polack]]]]\\nThere are only about fifteen main roads in Belarus, so if you are not staying in Belarus for long you can hitch through having just a print from any Internet source (for example, this [http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/google_map_belarus.htm]). More detailed maps can be bought in any kiosk of \"Bielsajuzdruk\" (\"Белсаюздрук\"), where newspapers are sold.\\n\\n== Eating ==\\nIn Belarus the road service is very poor, and restaurants in normal amount (for every 30-40 km) exists only on main roads, like [[E30]]/[[M1 (Belarus)|M1]]. But on the way there are usually a lot of small towns and villages, where in the shops you can find anything what you need (and 2-3 times cheaper than in a cafe). And of course, if you want to find some ready dishes, you can go to a students canteen or something like that.\\n\\n== Visa ==\\nForeign citizens of 74 countries, who \\'\\'\\'both enter\\'\\'\\' and \\'\\'\\'leave\\'\\'\\' via Minsk International Airport, can enter Belarus for up to 30 days \\'\\'\\'without visa\\'\\'\\' (since July 27, 2018). This does not extend to persons coming to Belarus by plane from Russia, as well as to those who would fly out via Russia (such flights are considered as internal ones and do not have border control).\\n\\nNevertheless you have to fulfil several requirements to be able to enter the country without visa. For more information check web-pages of the Belorussian MFA and State Border Committee of the Republic of Belarus:\\n\\n[http://mfa.gov.by/en/visa/visafreetravel/e0ced19bb1f9bf2c.html \\'\\'Information on visa-free travel via the checkpoint \"Minsk National Airport\"\\'\\']<br>\\n[https://gpk.gov.by/en/border-crossing/ \\'\\'Border crossing rules for foreign citizens\\'\\']\\n\\n[[File:Belarus_regional_visa-free_provisions_in_Grodno_and_Brest_regions.png|220px|thumb|right|Part of Belarus covered by Brest and Hrodna regional visa-free provision]]\\nAdditionally, you can also enter some parts of the country overland without a visa for up to 15 days. In order to visit Brest and Hrodna regions for 15 days without visas you need to get visa-free travel documents at least 72 hours before your journey to Belarus.\\n\\nFor more details check the following link: [https://bezviz.by/en/ \\'\\'Belarus visa free\\'\\'].\\n\\nFor an old-fashioned visa, follow this procedure:\\nTry to find someone on Couchsurfing/BeWelcome/TrustRoots who\\'d be willing to \"invite\" you to Belarus (thus you could apply for a \"private visit\" visa), as this would save you money in the visa application process - the only way to get a regular tourist visa is through an overpriced agency, which would be eager to book hotels on your behalf. Some embassies may be satisfied with a confirmed hotel booking, without an agency letter, but that would be up to their discretion. However, most Belarusian embassies will issue a \"private visit\" visa without a letter of invitation or other supporting documents where only the personal info of the inviting person would suffice if the visa duration is less than 30 days. In some cases, they may however ask for a copy of the inviting person\\'s passport but again that would be up to the discretion of the embassy personnel.\\n\\n\\'\\'[[user:uncle_sam01|uncle_sam01]] applied for a private visit visa at the embassy in Warsaw in July 2016 and was asked to provide a copy of the inviting person\\'s passport. Other than that the process was a mere formality.\\'\\'\\n\\n== Registration ==\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'UPDATE (2019): As from 2nd January 2019, foreigners can register online and for free. See [http://belarusfeed.com/belarus-allows-online-registration-tourists/] for more details on how to register online. Important caveat: online registration is NOT possible if you entered Belarus from Russia. In this case, you must register at a Department for Citizenship and Migration.\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nThe old-fashioned way:\\n\\nWhen travelling to Belarus, you have to be registered with the authorities as a \"temporary resident\" if you stay in the country for longer than 5 business days (\\'\\'\\'including Saturday!\\'\\'\\'). Registration consists of a Soviet-style blue stamp on the back of your \"Migration Card\" (you\\'ll get this at the border).How this is done will vary depending on where you stay:\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'1. Hotels only\\'\\'\\'\\nEasiest option - they\\'ll do it for you automatically and you won\\'t have to worry about it. In some rare instances, they may charge extra for registration.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'2. Couchsurfing/squatting/camping\\'\\'\\'\\nYou\\'ll have to visit the local \"Migration Department\" within 5 business days(\\'\\'\\'including Saturday!\\'\\'\\') \\'\\'\\'with your as well as your host\\'s passport\\'\\'\\'(they don\\'t have to be there in person, but if you don\\'t speak Russian, it\\'s best that they are). You\\'ll fill out a form and pay a fee(around EUR 10). It might sound scary, but it\\'s relatively straightforward. You should register with your first host upon arrival to Belarus for the entire duration of your stay(until your visa expires) - you won\\'t have to worry about/pay for registration again. Legally, you should re-register if you stay somewhere else for more than 5 days, but no one will bother you about this...\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'3. Couchsurfing+hotels\\'\\'\\'\\nThis is the most complicated option. Hotels will only register you for the duration of your booking. Once you check out, you\\'re no longer considered registered. Therefore, if you then stay with someone through couchsurfing, you\\'d need to register immediately, in person, as in option 2. If you register with a host first (regardless for how long) and \\'\\'\\'then\\'\\'\\' stay at a hotel, your previous registration becomes void and the hotel registration applies, so the moment you check out you need to re-register somewhere else (either stay in another hotel or register with a host - again the 5 day period won\\'t apply). You could ask the hotel to not stamp your card, so that your previous registration is still valid during and after your hotel stay but this is technically illegal and up to the receptionist\\'s discretion. ([[user:uncle_sam01|uncle_sam01]] got his hotel stamp on a sticky note with a \"you-naughty-boy\" gesture from the receptionist...) \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Lack of and/or incorrect registration will lead to fines for you and your host, sometimes even deportation!!! (if your host had a previous guest who also screwed up their registration, they\\'d be considered a repeat offender and would face a higher fine)\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nBasically, plan your first night in Belarus with a CS host and register with them until your visa expires. If you stay at a hotel afterwards, make sure they don\\'t stamp your migration card any more. Registration sounds way scarier than it is and shouldn\\'t deter you from visiting Belarus.\\n\\n== Border crossing ==\\n\\nBelarus is neither in the [[European Union]] nor in the [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen]] Common Travel Area, and most non-[[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] nationals would require a visa to enter the country. However, since July 2018 there is a possibility to enter the country without visa for citizens of about 80 foreign countries. See \"Visa\" section. \\n\\nYou can check [http://gpk.gov.by/en/maps/ochered.php border crossing queues] and find more [http://gpk.gov.by/en/maps/ detailed info about border crossings] at the web-site of State Border Committee of the Republic of Belarus.\\n\\n=== With [[Latvia]] (from east to west)===\\n* [https://www.google.com/maps/place/55%C2%B043\\'06.5%22N+26%C2%B052\\'27.4%22E/@55.718463,26.8721013,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d55.7184603!4d26.8742901?hl=en Urbany (BLR) / Silene (LV)] (bel.

The European route [[E30]] passes through it entering at [[Brest (Belarus)|Brest]] on the border with [[Poland]] and leaving at the [[Russia]]n border between [[Orša]] and [[Smolensk]]. It is a fantastic and easy-going place for hitchhiking and the police or the political system generally will not bother you at all, so once you have your visa (if needed) you can just relax and go for it. You will enjoy!\\n\\n== General information ==\\n72% of the population live in towns and cities, and virtually all the population speaks Russian as their first language. In rural areas a mix of Russian and Belarusian may be spoken. It is therefore better to make destination [[signs]] in Russian when hitchhiking.\\n\\nAlso, there are two versions of the Belarusian flag – the official one is the red-green flag (also jokingly known as “dusk over a swamp”), whereas the one used by the opposition is a three-striped white-red-white flag. For your own safety, it is not advised to demonstrate the latter one in public.\\n\\nFreedom of speech is very restricted in Belarus, try not to ask too many questions about mr. Lukashenko, people might get in trouble when saying something bad about their politics.\\n\\n== Language ==\\nIn big cities, especially Minsk, you can expect young people to speak at least a basic level of English. If you are hitch-hiking to Russia along [[E30]]/[[M1 (Belarus)|M1]], expect some truck drivers to speak Polish as well as Russian.\\n\\nLanguage barrier can cause some troubles since many drivers speak almost exclusively only Russian or \\'\\'Trasianka\\'\\', the mishmash of Belarusian and Russian, therefore learn some basic phrases in Russian before you go there. If you do understand some Russian but you are not familiar with Belarusian culture don\\'t get scared or disappointed hearing many swearing words when drivers talk to you – these words aren\\'t directed to you but are rather a simple hearty expression.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking ==\\n\\nHitchhiking in Belarus is very easy and rarely your waiting time will exceed 15 minutes, at least on the main road M1 from [[Brest]] via [[Minsk]] to [[Moscow]]. As it is very common in Belarus, often drivers may pick you up without being curious about you or what you are doing, sometimes no communication at all. Belarusian people can seem gloomy at first sight, but in the end they are mostly very nice and helpful and drop you on a good spot. In rare cases a small number of older drivers might ask for some money when giving you a ride – to avoid that, tell the driver about your intention to travel for free before you sit into the car (\\'\\'\"Ja puteshestvuju avtostopom, bez deneg\"\\'\\' [\\'\\'\"u\"\\'\\' is pronounced as \\'\\'\"oo\"\\'\\' in English] – \\'\\'\"I travel by hitch-hiking, not paying any money\"\\'\\'). Usually, just saying \\'no money\\' works just fine too. It might be more difficult if you are more than 2 persons travelling together – in such case it would be smart to split up for some time. \\n\\nWhen hitchhiking in Belarus, it is very likely to find some other people standing next to the road, waiting for a car to pick them up. Although most people do not speak English well, it is nice to try to make some contact. Most of them might look angry, but it\\'s just on the outside and once you start talking to them they\\'re just very friendly and warm people. Some Belarusians will even wait for an hour with you in a snowstorm, waiting for another car to stop :) \\n\\nRussian and Baltic truck drivers are reluctant to stop for hitchhikers in Belarus while Belarusian and Polish trucks are happy to have a company of some traveller(s). Hitchhiking at night is difficult but if you make yourself very visible you can get a ride even at two o\\'clock at night (some cars might stop just because a driver thinks you are police – light reflectors might give such an impression).\\n\\nThe average waiting time is about 20 minutes. It’s better to travel using main roads as road traffic on local roads is pretty poor. In Belarus there are no roads with limitations for hitchhikers, you can start stopping a car wherever you like, the only exception is bridges. Roadsides are usually wide enough to stop even a truck. Main roads are in a good condition while roads in rural areas might unpleasantly surprise you. \\n\\n[[File:IMG 20170717 154059.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Light-returning reflectinve band. This little thing can save you about 10€ when you meet the policy at the road]]\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Note\\'\\'\\': In Belarus you have to wear a flicker (light-returning element or reflective band) when you are on the road after sunset. The [[police]] have a plan to get some amount of violators each month, so the possibility of penalty (about € 10) is quite high. It\\'s better to buy a flicker (it costs from € 1), and it\\'s not a problem – now they are sold in any shop in Belarus. And it\\'s [[hitchhiker\\'s safety|a good idea]] to use them anyway when [[hitchhiking at night]].\\n\\n\\n== Maps ==\\n[[File:Ratmir_autostop_Minsk.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Ratmir]] hitching from [[Minsk]] to [[Polack]]]]\\nThere are only about fifteen main roads in Belarus, so if you are not staying in Belarus for long you can hitch through having just a print from any Internet source (for example, this [http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/google_map_belarus.htm]). More detailed maps can be bought in any kiosk of \"Bielsajuzdruk\" (\"Белсаюздрук\"), where newspapers are sold.\\n\\n== Eating ==\\nIn Belarus the road service is very poor, and restaurants in normal amount (for every 30-40 km) exists only on main roads, like [[E30]]/[[M1 (Belarus)|M1]]. But on the way there are usually a lot of small towns and villages, where in the shops you can find anything what you need (and 2-3 times cheaper than in a cafe). And of course, if you want to find some ready dishes, you can go to a students canteen or something like that.\\n\\n== Visa ==\\nForeign citizens of 74 countries, who \\'\\'\\'both enter\\'\\'\\' and \\'\\'\\'leave\\'\\'\\' via Minsk International Airport, can enter Belarus for up to 30 days \\'\\'\\'without visa\\'\\'\\' (since July 27, 2018). This does not extend to persons coming to Belarus by plane from Russia, as well as to those who would fly out via Russia (such flights are considered as internal ones and do not have border control).\\n\\nNevertheless you have to fulfil several requirements to be able to enter the country without visa. For more information check web-pages of the Belorussian MFA and State Border Committee of the Republic of Belarus:\\n\\n[http://mfa.gov.by/en/visa/visafreetravel/e0ced19bb1f9bf2c.html \\'\\'Information on visa-free travel via the checkpoint \"Minsk National Airport\"\\'\\']<br>\\n[https://gpk.gov.by/en/border-crossing/ \\'\\'Border crossing rules for foreign citizens\\'\\']\\n\\n[[File:Belarus_regional_visa-free_provisions_in_Grodno_and_Brest_regions.png|220px|thumb|right|Part of Belarus covered by Brest and Hrodna regional visa-free provision]]\\nAdditionally, you can also enter some parts of the country overland without a visa for up to 15 days. In order to visit Brest and Hrodna regions for 15 days without visas you need to get visa-free travel documents at least 72 hours before your journey to Belarus.\\n\\nFor more details check the following link: [https://bezviz.by/en/ \\'\\'Belarus visa free\\'\\'].\\n\\nFor an old-fashioned visa, follow this procedure:\\nTry to find someone on Couchsurfing/BeWelcome/TrustRoots who\\'d be willing to \"invite\" you to Belarus (thus you could apply for a \"private visit\" visa), as this would save you money in the visa application process - the only way to get a regular tourist visa is through an overpriced agency, which would be eager to book hotels on your behalf. Some embassies may be satisfied with a confirmed hotel booking, without an agency letter, but that would be up to their discretion. However, most Belarusian embassies will issue a \"private visit\" visa without a letter of invitation or other supporting documents where only the personal info of the inviting person would suffice if the visa duration is less than 30 days. In some cases, they may however ask for a copy of the inviting person\\'s passport but again that would be up to the discretion of the embassy personnel.\\n\\n\\'\\'[[user:uncle_sam01|uncle_sam01]] applied for a private visit visa at the embassy in Warsaw in July 2016 and was asked to provide a copy of the inviting person\\'s passport. Other than that the process was a mere formality.\\'\\'\\n\\n== Registration ==\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'UPDATE (2019): As from 2nd January 2019, foreigners can register online and for free. See [http://belarusfeed.com/belarus-allows-online-registration-tourists/] for more details on how to register online. Important caveat: online registration is NOT possible if you entered Belarus from Russia. In this case, you must register at a Department for Citizenship and Migration.\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nThe old-fashioned way:\\n\\nWhen travelling to Belarus, you have to be registered with the authorities as a \"temporary resident\" if you stay in the country for longer than 5 business days (\\'\\'\\'including Saturday!\\'\\'\\'). Registration consists of a Soviet-style blue stamp on the back of your \"Migration Card\" (you\\'ll get this at the border).How this is done will vary depending on where you stay:\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'1. Hotels only\\'\\'\\'\\nEasiest option - they\\'ll do it for you automatically and you won\\'t have to worry about it. In some rare instances, they may charge extra for registration.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'2. Couchsurfing/squatting/camping\\'\\'\\'\\nYou\\'ll have to visit the local \"Migration Department\" within 5 business days(\\'\\'\\'including Saturday!\\'\\'\\') \\'\\'\\'with your as well as your host\\'s passport\\'\\'\\'(they don\\'t have to be there in person, but if you don\\'t speak Russian, it\\'s best that they are). You\\'ll fill out a form and pay a fee(around EUR 10). It might sound scary, but it\\'s relatively straightforward. You should register with your first host upon arrival to Belarus for the entire duration of your stay(until your visa expires) - you won\\'t have to worry about/pay for registration again. Legally, you should re-register if you stay somewhere else for more than 5 days, but no one will bother you about this...\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'3. Couchsurfing+hotels\\'\\'\\'\\nThis is the most complicated option. Hotels will only register you for the duration of your booking. Once you check out, you\\'re no longer considered registered. Therefore, if you then stay with someone through couchsurfing, you\\'d need to register immediately, in person, as in option 2. If you register with a host first (regardless for how long) and \\'\\'\\'then\\'\\'\\' stay at a hotel, your previous registration becomes void and the hotel registration applies, so the moment you check out you need to re-register somewhere else (either stay in another hotel or register with a host - again the 5 day period won\\'t apply). You could ask the hotel to not stamp your card, so that your previous registration is still valid during and after your hotel stay but this is technically illegal and up to the receptionist\\'s discretion. ([[user:uncle_sam01|uncle_sam01]] got his hotel stamp on a sticky note with a \"you-naughty-boy\" gesture from the receptionist...) \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Lack of and/or incorrect registration will lead to fines for you and your host, sometimes even deportation!!! (if your host had a previous guest who also screwed up their registration, they\\'d be considered a repeat offender and would face a higher fine)\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nBasically, plan your first night in Belarus with a CS host and register with them until your visa expires. If you stay at a hotel afterwards, make sure they don\\'t stamp your migration card any more. Registration sounds way scarier than it is and shouldn\\'t deter you from visiting Belarus.\\n\\n== Border crossing ==\\n\\nBelarus is neither in the [[European Union]] nor in the [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen]] Common Travel Area, and most non-[[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] nationals would require a visa to enter the country. However, since July 2018 there is a possibility to enter the country without visa for citizens of about 80 foreign countries. See \"Visa\" section. \\n\\nYou can check [http://gpk.gov.by/en/maps/ochered.php border crossing queues] and find more [http://gpk.gov.by/en/maps/ detailed info about border crossings] at the web-site of State Border Committee of the Republic of Belarus.\\n\\n=== With [[Latvia]] (from east to west)===\\n* [https://www.google.com/maps/place/55%C2%B043\\'06.5%22N+26%C2%B052\\'27.4%22E/@55.718463,26.8721013,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d55.7184603!4d26.8742901?hl=en Urbany (BLR) / Silene (LV)] (bel.

The border is open, there is most likely no control and this means, that you will not recieve a Immigration card or an Entry stamp from Russia.

You can get on the A1 right after Lisburn. There is an exit about 2 KM after the town. You should take the second roundabout after leaving the motorway. There is plenty of space for cars to stop on Hillsborough Road, A1 as there is a red lane at the side.

From the town hall, walk south on Linehall st. This becomes Maryville st. -- keep going south. When you arrive at Donegall Pass, turn right and keep walking for about 20 minutes. Stay on Donegall road until you get to a huge roundabout with a big white sphere structure in the middle. Walk around the roundabout and just past the McDonalds there is a little metal barrier next to where the M1 starts. On the other side of this barrier, right before the sign for the M1 highway is an excellent spot. There is plenty of room for the cars to turn in, you are easily visible, and best of all you are not technically on the highway yet, so nobody can be mad at you. Most traffic here will be going south in the Dublin direction.\\n\\n=== Northwest towards [[Derry]] ===\\n\\nTake the number 96 bus (leaves from the city center) until you get to Dargan Crescent.

The main motorway ([[:Category:E75|E75]]/[[Autoput]]) runs close to the centre of the city from the northwest to the southeast. Most cars also use this as a normal road so hitching out of Belgrade is quite difficult.\\n\\n== Hitching out ==\\n=== Southeast towards [[Niš]], [[Sofia]], [[Skopje]] {{European Route Number|75}} ===\\nThere are several possibilities.\\n\\n==== Bus 493 ====\\nThis bus leaves the Central Bus Station of Belgrade for Mladenovac and passes through the new toll station at Vrčin. Ask the bus driver to drop you off right there, user [[Jungma]] observed two locals doing the very same thing. \\n\\nBus 461 leaves from Šumice and goes to Vrčin, however this means you will have to walk for about 1.5km from the stop at \\'Vrčin Ivo Lola Ribar (врчин иво лола рибар)\\'. You will travel a long way down the highway without stopping, don\\'t worry. After you get out, cross over the highway and take the first right turn down the street \\'Moše Pijade (моше пијаде)\\'. Keep following this road next to the highway and after about 1.5km you will see the toll station which you can start hitching from.\\n\\n==== Bus 31 ====\\nTake bus 31 from the city centre (from the squares \\'\\'Trg Studentski\\'\\' or \\'\\'Trg Slavia\\'\\' or in front of the large McDonalds) or bus number 17 going from Zemun, through Novi Beograd, until you get to the intersection of the streets \\'\\'Ustanička\\'\\' and \\'\\'Vojislava Ilića\\'\\' (ask someone in the bus for the stop \\'\\'Sumice\\'\\', but in case you miss is it two stops before the last - on the right you will see a pekara and it\\'s a bigger intersection after going uphill for a while). Turn around and go left, walk to the bridge, cross it, go downstairs, and walk around 150m to the right from the bridge. There you will find a on-ramp to the motorway, and it is the spot from where you can hitchhike towards the toll station. (Alternatively you can walk down the motorway for a couple of hundred meters further and talk to people on a petrol station. This might work better, because many people using the on-ramp are not leaving Belgrade). You should have sign which says \"RAMPA\" (toll station) or \"Vrčin\" (where the new toll station is located) in order to get a lift, otherwise you risk staying there for a long time. Once you reach the toll station, it is easy to get direct rides all the way to Greece, Bulgaria, Macedonia or even Turkey if the driver allows you to sleep the night in his truck.\\n* \\'\\'[[User:Nero12|Nero12]] (July 2011) Yup, it works great.\\'\\'\\n* \\'\\'[[User:Rozwal|Rozwal]] (October 2011) had a sign RAMPA and got a ride with a man going out of the highway just before Rampa so the sign proved very very useful.\\'\\'\\n* \\'\\'[[User:NixyJungle|NixyJungle]]\\'\\' (2011-2015) I was HH two times on the \"on ramp\" and waiting for about 30 minutes until I got a ride. Not good spot at all. Most of the cars go inside the city. Walk to the petrol station called AVIA (200 meters). You will see it from this \"on ramp\" spot. I hitchhiked there many times. Not so much cars, but the ones that stop for petrol, usually go to the toll gate Bubanj Potok. Depends on traffic, you could wait between 1 and 30 minutes. At least, you are not standing on a dusty road, but waiting like a gentleman for a car to pick you up :)\\n* \\'\\'[[User:TurtleGrass|TurtleGrass]] (August 2015) Went with this option, following the \\'RAMPA\\' advice, worked out great! Only waited about 30mins.\\n* [[User:Antonopa|Antonopa]] (May 2016) Works great, I had to wait about 5 mins to get to the toll station, then about an hour to get a ride from the toll station all the way to Niš. Watch out for the police though, they will move you further down the road if you stand too close to the toll station.\\n* [[User:Antonopa|Antonopa]] (April 2017) second time using this spot, it\\'s perfect, a lot of traffic heading in the right direction, very easy to get a lift over to the toll station, and from there easy to catch a ride with a truck. Made the trip from belgrade to skopje in 10hrs starting from here at 1200.\\n* [[User:Janos|Janos]] (June 2018) The toll station in BUBANJ POTOK is not in use anymore! There is a new toll station in in VRČIN (some 5 km further). I waited for an hour at the gas station, then decided to start asking people directly and the first person took me.\\n* [[User:justgettingaround|Justgettingaround]] (August 2019) Went to the petrol station and asked directly; got a ride within 5 minutes from some really cool musicians going to Skopje. Wasn´t headed there; got off before the toll station and started hitching with trucks through pretty much the entire country. Super kind guys, made sure we got as far as they could get us, made it to Bulgarian border until our driver got screwed bc he forgot his ID and we had to hitch at the border crossing; no trouble at all, though, got in a cute lil van and made it to Sofia from Belgrade in one day. Was recommended to write signs in both the Latin/Romanic and Cyrillic alphabets. \\n\\n==== Trolleybus 29 ====\\nAlternative (worked very well, a number of times, requires very little walking/riding on busses): If you are in the downtown area, past Slavia, near the big market and Mackenzie street (serbian: Makenzijeva ulica), you can take trolleybus 29 out until it comes to a long bridge with blue railings. This bridge crosses the motorway (among many other things). If you get out before the bridge and cross to the side where traffic is coming in the opposite direction (don\\'t go all the way across the length of the bridge), there are stairs going down that lead to the motorway, from which, you can walk just a few meters and find a shoulder with enough space for cars to pull over, perfect for hitchhiking!\\n\\n- [[User:Chillion|Chillion]] (2018) This method is relatively easy, as long as you excerise caution. I missed the blue railing bridge by a stop after, so had to walk back which took 10 mins. Getting to the spot requires care. Took me about 1 hr to get a ride, only because I was using the wrong sign (NS for Novi Sad, I thought it meant Nis). When I used the correct sign (Nis-Nais) I got picked up in less than 10 mins. Arrived in Sofia that same day (luck was severely on my side). It is very likely that you\\'ll also be able to catch a ride straight to Nis on this spot.\\n\\nNote: Jeremie used this spot and would like it made clear that it is dangereous, even if it works well.\\n\\n2nd note: Wouter and Michiel used this spot an stood along the motorway for 3 hours holding a big Niš sign without being picked up. They eventually decided to take the bus to Sofia.\\n\\n==== Tram 7 ====\\nThis option involves less walking along the motorway. From the city centre, take tram 7 in the direction south-east until the last stop (takes about 15 minutes, depending on the traffic). From there take bus 308, direction Veliki Mokri Lug (sometimes written as V.M.L.). After about ten minutes you will cross a bridge going over the motorway; get out at the next stop 100 meters later. From the bridge you will already see the petrol station where you want to go, which is about 200 meters walking. This petrol station is also located uphill. (This info is not entirely correct, I spent 4 hours while trying to get out of Belgrade. There is no way to reach the stop of 308 with Tram 7. You have to get off at Vukadin memorial or shortly Vuk and from there on, walk to a nearby kiosk and catch bus 6A, then go to the last stop Ustanicka and walk down the street. There you can catch 308 to VML. The petrol station is a pretty good place to hitchhike, just don\\'t be in it, cause there\\'s just a few cars stopping and you\\'ll be waiting quite a lot)\\n(well, info is good - but from time to time officials do some tram-track repair, so tram 7 doesn\\'t go further then Vukov spomenik (also, not Vukadin, his name was Vuk). In that case bus 6a runs. Otherwise, going to last stop Ustanička and going down stairs through this big mall and crossing the street will bring you to bus 308 stop).\\n\\nA sign saying \"10 K.M.\" might be helpful in catching a local car which can take you to the first toll stop (a hitchhiking stop regularly used by locals) and out of the intense exhaust fumes.\\n\\nIf you\\'re heading for Niš (or beyond) try using a sign (saying Niš). If going beyond Niš remember to leave the car *on the motorway* - not in Niš, unless you\\'re a big fan of walking. About two hundred meters before the motorway split Niš and Sofia ([[Bulgaria]]) is an working toll station where you can easily find a long distance ride.\\n\\nTo hitchhike towards Niš, you should first reach the toll station, which can be a bit tricky, since you have to hitchhike while you are still in the city.\\n\\nFind the map on http://www.serbiatravelers.org/en/index.php/hitchhiking/145-beograd\\n\\n\\n==== Bus 26 ====\\nThis option is easy and works well if you like hitching from service stations and asking people instead of tolls/signs on the side of the road.\\nFrom the city center bus station \"Trg Republike\" take bus 26 towards \"Nazelje Brace Jerkovic\" until \"Peke Pavlovika\" (11 stops, 25minutes, costs 150 Serbia  Dinars) which is the second stop after the bus crosses over the highway. From the bus stop it is only 10 minutes walking towards the East to reach the highway at a place where you get to a service station from the company \"MOL\" and there is no fence!\\nSome local people will tell you to go to another place nearby where you can stand by the road - it is used by locals but way more dangerous than the fuel station!\\n\\n* [[User:MartinJ888|MartinJ888]] August 2022: Hitched there with a friend (two men), it took us about 1 hour to get a ride towards Nis.\\n\\n=== Southwest towards [[Sarajevo]] and [[Montenegro]] ===\\n[[File:Donraspunicum.jpeg|right|thumb|150px|[[User:Kristian|Kristian]] hitchhiking towards [[Čačak]] in Belgrade (2013)]]\\nThere are 2 ways to Sarajevo, one through Čačak-Uzice, a bit south, the other one more direct but not written on online maps... The one through Čačak worked well for us. Take the bus 53 from the green open market called \"Zelena pijaca\" (the stop is called \\'\\'Zeleni venac\\'\\') in the center, to the last station (\\'\\'Vidikovac\\'\\'). Then just follow the street for one minute, turn right, here is the exit to the motorway, climb up the bridge and try to hitchhike there, there is some place for cars to pull over, but in Serbia when they want to stop the car the dont really need a proper place ;). It seems that buses 531, 532, 533 go further, but it\\'s not really needed, and they might be regional buses. Use signs ČA and/or UE (ČaČak-Uzice). [[User:P40fA|Jan]] hitched a ride to Čačak in Sep 2018 here in ten minutes.\\n\\nThis way through Čačak-Uzice is not the fastest but in t0ma5´s opinion very interesting, it will take you 6-7 hours to reach Sarajevo and before leaving Serbia you will pass near by GuČa, where a crazy Balkan music festival takes place every summer and just before the Bosnian border is Mokra Gora, the ethno village that the filmmaker Kusturica made for his movie, Life is a Miracle, you can visit it in few hours if you have the times but there is entrance fee.\\n\\nAfter Uzice there is not much traffic going to Bosnia since after the border and before Sarajevo there is not any big city, so if you get a ride the driver will probably take u all the way to Sarajevo :)\\n\\nThis route is also useful to get to Montenegro - just use the \\'\\'Montenegro\\'\\' or \\'\\'MNE\\'\\' sign after you get out of Belgrade. The drivers usually go through Nova Varoš and Bijelo Polje.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Novi Sad]] and [[Budapest]] {{European Route Number|75}} ===\\nIt\\'s best to take bus number 706 from Zeleni Venac station (big bus station in the city center) to Batajnica, around 15 kilometers away and 40 minutes by bus (depending on traffic jams). The same bus goes through Zemun. You also have 706E, which is an express bus, faster than 706, and starts from Zemun (Kej Oslobodjenja - Zemun center) going to Batajnica. You can also take bus number 73 from New Belgrade. Ask the driver to let you off at Batajnica where the highway crosses the bus road.\\n\\nThere is a map on http://www.serbiatravelers.org/en/index.php/hitchhiking/145-beograd\\n\\nIf you wish to hitchhike on the motorway, you should exit at the overpass just before entering Batajnica and walk up to the highway. There is a lot of space for cars to pull down. Try to get any ride to the highway toll gate / péage on the way to [[Novi Sad]], where all cars have to stop. There you can ask people to take you further, even to Hungary (edited by [[User:NixyJungle|NixyJungle]]).\\n\\n* [[User:Evolverine]] Hitchhiking on the highway was awful, cars going way too fast to even consider picking anyone up. Plus I was confused by the supposed toll booth / péage that I just couldn\\'t find (it is near [[Novi Sad]], so don\\'t bother looking for it; I updated the wiki to make it more clear). So after a couple of minutes I went to the road the cars from Belgrade took to get onto the highway, here [http://osm.org/go/xf15v6be1-?m=] / geo:44.88789,20.30195?z=17 (not marked on the map above), and in about 2h I got a ride to the border with Hungary, after which it was easy to get another ride to [[Budapest]]. But the general feeling that it\\'s hard to hitch out of Belgrade seems accurate.\\n* [[User:Luelle]] Another option if you don\\'t want to ride a bus for so long: Take the 95 Bus from the city center to New Belgrade and exit at the station called Sava Center. It stops directly passed a bridge that is over the highway. Exit the bus and walk towards the bridge, you will see a petrol station on the highway to the right which is the direction Novi Sad/ Budapest. This a petrol station which you can use to get a short ride out of the city. Finding a long ride is pretty unlikely from this point since its mostly local traffic. Beware: Bring some cardboard with you. There isn\\'t anything around.\\n* [[User:schlaraffenkind]] I found a different and much easier way to hitchhike out of Belgrade. Take the Bus 601 from New Belgrade to the bus station \"Tošin bunar\". From Tošin bunar take bus 611 to the station \"Zmaj\". It stops right in front of a petrol station which is also called (Benzinska stanica NIS Petrol) \"Zmaj\" (2 stops from Tošin bunar but it\\'s also so obvious, it will be hard to miss). It\\'s outside of the city and on the E-70 motorway. The motorway that leads straight to Zagreb and is right before the junction that leads to Budapest. Definitely try this route if you are in doubt about the others. I got a ride within 5 minutes towards Novi Sad and then just before Novi Sad another one to the border with Hungary.\\n\\nwww.instagram.com/santi_viajasimplemente/\\nIt is possible to take the underground or train to the station zemun that goes to batajnica every hour and seems to be free :), from there walk 600 to the service station with McDonald\\'s. I got a ride there after 1 hour.\\n\\n=== Northeast towards [[Timișoara]] ([[Romania]]) {{European Route Number|70}} ===\\nTake a bus from the center (25/25-P will work) to the base of the \\'\\'Pančevački most\\'\\' (the bridge over Dunav/Danube -- not any of the ones over the Sava). Take another bus (e.g. 101, 102, 103...) over the bridge, and get off at the first stop after the bridge. Turn around and walk to the elevated motorway back in the direction the bus came (<\\xa0100\\xa0m). This is the E-70. Coming from the bus stop, the direction East is on the far side of the motorway, so you need to walk under it and then climb up to the level of the highway. Walk right along it (there is a guardrail, so it\\'s not too scary) until you come to a traffic light with a place for buses/cars to pull over immediately afterwards. This is the perfect hitch spot. Continue on the E70 towards Pančevo and Vršač and eventually the [[Stamora Moravița-Vatin border crossing]] into Romania. Be aware that Romanian drivers may expect money, so if a car with a Romanian number plate stops, explain that you will not pay.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'MARCH 2017\\'\\'\\': I recommend you to take the bus that goes right away from Belgrade to Pančevo (I think number 95, but check it). Once you are in that village it goes super fast. It takes longer to go first to that spot after the bridge and find a straight ride to Timișoara than going first to Pančevo, because most of the cars go to small villages around, and normally the ones that leave from that village go to Timișoara.\\n\\n=== West towards [[Zagreb]] {{European Route Number|70}} ===\\nTake bus no. 16 or 17 from the upper part of Zeleni Venac station towards Novi Beograd, and exit after you pass traffic circle. Cross the street, and take bus no. 611. To check bus connections: [http://www.eway.rs/en/cities/beograd/routes] . That bus will take you to the motorway, some 20 kilometers from Belgrade. Get off as soon as the bus turns from the motorway, and then return to the motorway. Start hitchhiking there. \\nThe toll station is around 7-8 kilometers far, but there\\'s no need to go there on foot. When cars stop, ask them to take you at least until the toll station. If they leave the last exit before, they can drop you off there. (There is a gas station, what can be reached from behind). You can walk from there to the toll station (ca. 1 km).\\nOnce you get to the toll station, we recommend using a sign for the direction you want to go, it is a good opportunity to get a direct ride, even all the way to Zagreb.\\n\\nFrom Belgrade to Zagreb advice is good you take bus 611 to end of town. Better not try to hitchhike on first petrol station Zmaj after Novi Belgrade, you can really stuck there for few hours. Hundreds of cars coming on that place but almost all of them were going back to Belgrade or to Novi Sad and just few of them to Croatia. Take  611 and go out just near road to air port than you just walk few minute on high way and come to petrol station. That is last  petrol station in direction to Croatia and there also  people can turn to Novi Sad and not in direction to Croatia. You just need to catch ride to pay tolls. When you at pay tolls, there is much  easier to catch ride to Zagreb or any part of Croatia.(June 2013)\\n\\nJust to write some more info, (June 2014). This time it was much easier to catch ride even on petrols station Zmaj outside of Novi Belgrade and without going more further with bus 616 to last petrol station near airport and pay tolls. It was same as last year a lot of cars where there on Zmaj petrol station and a lot of them were going back to Belgrade(It was mistake last year to ask drivers if they go to Croatia, just ask everyone to get you to pay tolls in Šimanovci) . Speak with people that work on petrol station an they will help you to catch ride, ask every driver just to drive you to Šimanovci-name of place where pay tolls are and from there is much easier to move forward Croatia. On Zmaj petrol station is forbidden to stop for trucks(specially for foreign trucks, trucks can not drive through Belgrade), only trucks with special license can stop there and  they will be local Serbian trucks but they can go to pay tolls, try to ask them. On second petrol station after airport is allowed for all trucks. There are also helpful people that work on petrols station or girls that cleans cars to catch some money for summer , they could help you if you ask them. Serbian registration that could go to pay tolls are ŠI, RU,  SM ask them or any other foreign driver, they will all go to pay tolls or Croatia.\\n\\nIf you want to hitchhiking directly from the toll station, it is also possible, but quite a long way. You are sure to get a ride pretty far though, it might be useful if you want to have a long ride. In April 2018, I`ve waited 1min and got a ride direct to Munich.\\nHow to get there : find a bus that goes to Novi Beograd and take the bus 711 in direction of Simanovci, the village where there is the toll station. \\nYou can take for example bus 65 from Zeleni Venac (the bus passes in the street, not in the bus station ; the street is Zeleni Venac and it goes across the bridge towards Zemun, Novi Beograd, etc.) and get out at stop Pariske Komune after a big round about. From there, come back to the round about and take a left on Bulevar Mihajla Pupina. Stay on the side of the road where cars go towards the round about, not from the round about! And walk a minute to the next bus stop and take the 711 til the last stop named Simanovci Centar. This is a 50min ride and you can easily blackride the bus.\\nfor info about the 711 bus https://www.busevi.com/mapa-linije-711-novi-beograd-paviljoni-ugrinovci-izlaz-simanovci/\\nFrom Simanovci Centar, continue straight on the main road for about 20min. Take a left on Dositejeva ulica for about 5min and you`re there!\\n\\n== Blackriding ==\\nControllors are going into the vehicles with a mini computer for checking your e-cards (cards are called BusPlus). Normal BusPlus cards are blue coloured and they have red ones. When you spot them, just ignore them and leave on the next stop. Controls are quite common and with the new pricing system, a single ride bought from the driver is quite expensive (150 dinars).\\n\\n== WiFi ==\\n* Main train station: network \\'\\'Peron\\'\\' code \\'\\'internet\\'\\' (they have changed it already, but in the smaller hall /not the one they sell train tickets in, but with the money exchange office/, you can catch some wifis without passwords, something like AUDInumbers)\\n* Studentski Park has free wifi, just look for an open network that has the word \\'free\\' in it.\\n\\n== Sleeping ==\\nWe slept near the river, under the bridge we came in at 5am and slept until 1300 no one disturbed us.\\n\\n[[nomad:Belgrade]]\\n\\n[[Category:Serbia]]\\n[[Category:E75]]\\n[[Category:E70]]\\n[[fr:Belgrade]]\\n__NOTOC__',\n",

Almost any lift can take you to the service area Grauholz which is some 5 kilometers past Bern, a sign \\'\\'Grauholz\\'\\' can usually get there as fast as the train in Option 3. Option 3 will tell you how to get to Grauholz directly.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1: Ostring\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nFrom the train station, take tram #7 to Ostring (final station). Just stand in front of the motorway entrance. It\\'s a fairly decent spot -- cars can\\'t see you from far away, but there\\'s ample space for stopping before the highway sign, and in case of rain you can shelter and hitch under the motorway bridge. A sign is helful since there are many potential directions for people to go.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2: Murtenstrasse\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nThis on-ramp is a bit closer to the center and has reasonable traffic flow. The on-ramp itself is not great anymore to hitch, it\\'s an illegal spot to stand in and people are reluctant to stop since there is no dedicated shoulder (although there is a split in lanes where someone might stop). However you can position yourself before the \\'Güterbahnhof\\' bus stop (best is with a sign) where people still go rather slowly and have a space to stop. The spot is to the West of the center: follow Laupenstrasse and then Murtenstrasse past the Inselspital hospital. You can take bus #11 to Güterbahnhof. You can also easily approach people (with a sign or without) at the traffic lights. This on-ramp also has cars going towards Thun. \\n\\n[[File:Ostring.jpg|thumb|Ostring]]\\n\\n[[File:Wankdorfplatz.jpg|thumb|Wankdorfplatz]]\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3: Grauholz\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nTake the S9 from Bern Hauptbahnhof to the end stop (Unterzollikofen), then walk over the fields eastwards to the rest area \"Grauholz\". It\\'s all in fairly walkable distance and besides, probably a pretty lovely walk in the spring and summer months due to the sunflower fields. Take a picture from the map with your camera, it might come handy. Its Nr.1-Spot if you go north or east.\\n\\n=== South-West towards [[Lausanne]], [[Geneva|Genève]] via [[Fribourg]] or [[Yverdon]] ===\\n\\nOptions follow in loose order of usefulness. Another option is to catch a lift to the service station Grauholz on the north side of the city (or check option 3 above on how to get their by public transport), change sides (there is a bridge) and ask at the gas station for rides south as it can be hard to find a ride going as far as the next service station to the south from any of the on-ramps below. If you\\'re going to anywhere before Lausanne, be aware that there are two different highways between Bern and Lausanne and make sure that your on-ramp serves the one you want. \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1: Wankdorfplatz\\'\\'\\'\\nFrom the train station, take bus #20 to the station Wyler (buy a ticket \\'zone 1-2\\' for 4 CHF, or don\\'t). Walk 200m on the right side of the street (on your right you see a huge stadium, then cross the big crossroads. There\\'s a perfect bus stop. Better use a sign.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2: Murtenstrasse\\'\\'\\'\\nSee Option 2 above. Doable spot for hitchhiking towards Lausanne, too. Either stand before the Güterbahnhof bus stop with a sign or walk up the on-ramp where northbound and southbound traffic split and hitch right there. Technically illegal, but odds are small that you will wait long enough to run into any trouble.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3: Weissensteinstrasse\\'\\'\\'\\nTake tram 7 or 8 to Schlossmatte, for example from Hirschengraben near the train station. Backtrack a bit and turn right down Huberstrasse, before you turn right again and follow Weissensteinstrasse until you see the motorway signs. This isn\\'t a very good spot as several directions meet very close to the on-ramp, but by working with signs, you can still get a ride down towards Lausanne.\\n\\n=== South towards Thun ===\\n\\nYou can use option 2 of going towards Zurich or options 1 or 3 of going towards Lausanne, but best is the option below.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1: Ostring\\'\\'\\'\\nFrom the train station, take tram #7 to Ostring (final station). There is a place where many lanes come together and it\\'s a bit chaotic for a hitcher, but luckily there is a stoplight you can stand next to, so during a red light drivers will be forced to look at you. There isn\\'t enough space for cars to pull over, but not heaps, so keep your things close by and ready to chuck into the car when a spot is offered.\\n\\n== Sleeping ==\\n\\nThere are many hidden spots along the river where somebody could camp out for a night or a couple if the weather is nice. \\n\\nThere is a \\'\\'Wagenplatz\\'\\' by the E25 north of Bern, outside Bethlehem.

It takes about 30 minutes walking from pont battant in the center.\\n\\n===Aire de Besançon===\\n{{Coords|47.3272|6.1278}} Going east<br>\\n{{Coords|47.3296|6.1273}} Going west<br>\\nAnother, better, option depénding on the time and day of leaving Besançon, is to go the service station \\'\\'Aire de Besançon Champoux\\'\\' and \\'\\'Aire de Besançon Marchaux\\'\\' in heading west and éast, respectively.\\nTo reach the service station, take bus 71 at the bus station \\'\\'Orchamps\\'\\'. You can cônsult the timetable here [[timetable]] to know the departing times. Alight at the 9th stop, \\'\\'Champoux-Mairie\\'\\', then walk back on the D346 where the bus was coming from until you reach the motorway, then turn right on D138 and walk to the service station, about 10-15 minutes total walking. If you are heading east, there is a footbridge to take you to McD then to the station on the other side.\\n\\n=== Southeast toward [[Pontarlier]], [[Lausanne]] {{E|23}} ===\\n{{Coords|47.2299|6.0369}}<br>\\nThe spot is at the petrol station, and never takes more than 30 min (can be 4...). For this you have to walk out of the centre to the crossing called \\'\\'Rivotte\\'\\' (near the tunnel under the citadel), then follow the road in direction of [[Pontarlier]]. Next good point is the \\'\\'round-about\\'\\' {{Coords|47.157739|6.2522507|1}} close to [[Valdahon]], don\\'t take a ride which goes closer than this point.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Vesoul]] or [[Vosges]] ===\\n{{Coords|47.2545|6.0148}}<br>\\nSame spot to get to Valentin from the center as described above. Wait for a long ride, or ask if people can stop you in \\'\\'Cayenne\\'\\', or next to \\'\\'Quenoche\\'\\' where cars have to slow down. Don\\'t go to Rioz.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Gray]] ===\\nTake tramway 2 or 1 until the end, direction \\'\\'haut de chazal\\'\\'. Walk 20 minutes to \\'\\'Franois\\'\\', until the second roundabout. Take the D75 direction, and stop at the next roundabout, then it\\'s easy to get a ride towards Marnay and Gray. \\n\\nYou can also go to the motorway A36 entrance from this spot.\\n\\n== Public transport ==\\n\\nA local bus ticket costs EUR 1.40 and is valid for one hour on any buses or/and tramway.\\nBe careful on Sundays there is \\'\\'\\'no\\'\\'\\' bus to go the péage!

It has 51.000 citizens and is located in the northwest of [[Switzerland]], at the Jura-mountainchain and at the lake of Biel/Bienne. The town is famous for its watches - companies like Omega and Rolex are amongst the most important employers.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== East, South towards [[Bern]], [[Thun]], [[Interlaken]], [[Fribourg]], [[Burgdorf]] ===\\nFrom the main train station in Biel: Leave the trainstation through the back exit (towards lake, Nidau). There is a big COOP-Supermarket, walk to the other side of it (right through it or across the street on the right side of it). As you reach a street, turn right. After some hundred meters there is a big crossroads. Cross the street and turn left (obviously towards \"Bern\" - there are big green signs). After about 300m there is a BP petrol station, right before the motorway A6 starts. \\nHitchwiki user Cee always stands some meters before the railway lines that cross the street - there, drivers will see you from far a way and they can stop easily. Time to walk from the train station to this spot: 5min.\\n\\nThis higway A6 will lead right into the big motorway A1 towards [[Bern]], [[Interlaken]], [[Fribourg]], [[Geneva|Genève]] and there\\'s no gasstation to get out before.

After about 10min walking you find a main road with a lot of traffic. Turn right and follow this street, you can already try to stop cars here. There are bus stops (#1, #2) where cars have space to stop. After about 2km the motorway A5 going to [[Zürich]] and [[Basel]] starts.\\n\\nOPTION 2\\nTake Bus #2 to \"Industrie Bözingen\" and get out at the stop \"Renferstrasse\". Walk another 300m and you\\'re right at the entry to the motorway - perfect!

At least some people say so...\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n=== Towards [[Gütersloh]], [[A33 (Germany)|A33]] (towards [[Paderborn]]), [[A2 (Germany)|A2]] North or South ([[Dortmund]], [[Hannover]])===\\n\\nYou have the option of starting right in the center of the city on the Stadtautobahn (city highway), near the train station. This highway turns into the A33 towards Paderborn and has a crossing with the A2 at Kreuz Bielefeld. Some of the central on-ramps look daunting because they lack stopping space... but people are friendly and [[User:Zenit|Zenit]] has never had to wait longer than 5-10 minutes for a ride. You\\'ll likely need 2-3 lifts jumping from exit to exit to get to a service area (or, if going towards Paderborn, a parking area -- works); if you\\'re trying to get onto the A2, the last exit before Kreuz Bielefeld is a safe bet. \\n\\n=== North-East, South-West towards [[A2 (Germany)|A2]] ([[Dortmund]], [[Hannover]]) ===\\n\\nYou have several options to go onto the [[A2 (Germany)|A2]].\\n*Start on the Stadtautobahn: See above\\n*Take a tram (2, green) towards \\'\\'Sieker\\'\\' and get off at the last stop. There is some space to stop cars right behind the traffic lights in direction of [[A2 (Germany)|A2]] ([[on-ramp]] \\'\\'BI-Zentrum\\'\\'). You can hitch a ride here all the way along \\'\\'Detmolder Strasse\\'\\' until that point where a road leading to A2 begins. Get out here and walk behind the traffic lights some 50m over the grass until you can stand on the [[shoulder|hard shoulder]]. Wave you thumb and hitch a ride to the [[highway|motorway]]. See map for further clarification.\\n** I prefer the tram 3 (yellow) to the last stop at \\'\\'Stieghorst\\'\\', go 200m to the same road \\'\\'Detmolder Strasse\\'\\' and continue to the left. This way you are nearly at the highway and can ask the cars at the traffic lights (the last ones before the highway) or go over to a stopping place (see above). If you wanna go anywhere on the A2 it\\'s a good spot as there are 2 petrol stations in aprox. 10-15km on the highway on each side (south-west and north-east), where you can easily change sides via a tunnel/bridge.\\n*Take a bus (350 or 351 towards Bad Salzuflen) and get off at \\'\\'Runkelkrug\\'\\', right after passing under the motorway. If you turn right and walk on the grass next to the motorway for about five minutes, you end up at the new service station which is called something along the lines of \"Lippländer Land\". This is a great spot for finding rides up towards Hannover and further up (Hamburg, Berlin). \\'\\'\\'Note: This is a north-bound only service station; across the road there is a parking only!\\'\\'\\'\\n*The following are old directions that used to lead you to a highway service station that now has been converted to a parking. It can still be used, but getting here from Bielefeld is rather inconvenient comparing to the option right above.<br>Take a train or a bus to [[Herford]] from where you can take a bus to \\'\\'Alten Markt\\'\\' (many bus lines); from there you can take the line #S5 to the bus-stop \\'\\'Tierpark\\'\\'. When at \\'\\'Tierpark\\'\\', keep on walking to the motorway. When you are in front of a bridge walk right for the [[rest area|service station]] (now parking) towards [[Dortmund]], and further behind the bridge if heading to [[Hannover]].\\n\\n=== North towards [[Osnabrück]], [[Halle (Westfalen)]], [[A33 (Germany)|A33]] ===\\nIf going north, this might be the best option: Take a tram towards \\'\\'Brackwede Bahnhof\\'\\'. Get off at that stop, walk across to Brackwede station and the tunnel that underpasses the rails. On the other side of the tunnel, there is a meadow and you can see the road leading out of Bielefeld. There is space for cars to pull over some 100m further on. Additionally, you could ask drivers at the supermarket just next to you, but traffic might be quite local in there.\\n\\n== Sleeping ==\\n\\nThere is a castle called Sparrenburg on a hill near the center. When you come through the main gate, there is a cozy dark hole/room in the ramparts on your left... probably it gets checked routinely when they close the gate in the evening, but the gate itself is a very simple climbing job and failing that, there is lots of cozy bushes around up there.\\n\\n== Food ==\\n\\nIn the center, there is a Vapiano branch. Table diving can be done but involves a fair amount of waiting. Good dumpsterdiving has been confirmed in the supermarkets around the S-Bahn stop of Babenhausen-Süd.\\n\\n== Public Transport ==\\n\\nGetting onto busses for free is hard, the drivers check for tickets. If many people get on, an old ticket might do the trick. The trams and S-Bahn are easy to blackride, inspections are reasonably rare. Inspectors are known to wear both plain clothes and uniform.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n[[Category:North Rhine-Westphalia]]\\n[[Category:Germany]]\\n\\n[[de:Bielefeld]]',\n",

The [[M40 (GB)|M40]] heads to London and [[Oxford]]. The M5, M6 and M42 all form a box around the city. The A38(M) (better known as the Aston Expressway) gets traffic in and out of the city centre and on to the M6 at the infamous Spaghetti Junction.\\n\\nIf you are just passing by, \\'\\'\\'don\\'t go into the city!\\'\\' Instead, use the services stations scattered on the motorways to get to the right motorway.

[http://motorwayservicesonline.co.uk/services/hilton/ Hilton Park], [http://motorwayservicesonline.co.uk/services/tamworth/ Tamworth] and [http://motorwayservicesonline.co.uk/services/corley/ Corley] are not too far away.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Manchester]], South towards [[Bristol]] ===\\nThe Frankley Service station can be accessed easily, by taking the bus #22 (1.70£ from the center), getting off at the final destination (Kitwell). From there, it is only a short walk to the motorway, following the road you came on and turning right. There is a bridge, so you can get a lift to either northern and southern directions. On the service station, you can\\'t ask around the petrol station (because of \"health and safety\"), so your best bet is asking people as they go into and out of the resting area.\\n\\nBirmingham also has an airport and a railway station in the city centre. The National Exhibition Centre (NEC) is another good place to hitch from, it is close to both the motorway and the airport and is widely visited by car drivers.\\n\\nYou might actually be able to hitch out of Birmingham on the M6 from the Spaghetti junction - there is a space where cars can pull over, although they are going quite fast and in two lanes, and police are going past quite frequently. This might be an option if you\\'re really skint, as the junction is quite central. Another option are the petrol stations around Junction 2 on the M5, however there are two and the only reasonable spot for going South.

It\\'s great to see the countryside from the back of a truck; you should have a warm blanket or a sleeping bag on you when you travel like that.\\n\\nMany toll boots offer to find you a ride if you arrive to them by foot.\\nThere are many of them, and after a short conversation there is good chance they will offer to get you a ride.\\n\\nWhen you\\'re in Bolivia, it really depends on the region when you\\'re hitchhiking.\\n\\nHowever, [[User:Stickbugg|stickbugg]] hitchhiked from La Paz to Cochabamba in July of 2014, in two days, and offers the following general advice, perhaps applicable to most of Bolivia:<br>\\n-There is no cultural notion of hitchhike which is easy to work with, save for that of poor countryside peasants looking to get into the city. Prepare to explain in Spanish why you do not want to take a bus, for example. Bolivians will try to help you in a number of ways, but usually by setting you up with a paid bus. Be honest about having no money and wanting to ride with people for adventure.<br>\\n-Agree on cost or no cost of fare (pasaje) ahead of time, since is it normal in Bolivia for fare to be charged upon getting off of transit, and what seems like a free ride for many hours may not be upon getting out. This is not a scam, it is just a cultural thing you have to be aware of. Others may find it unthinkable for you to pay, since they are going that way anyway.<br>\\n-In Spanish, the word for \"to camp\" (campar), can apply to staying overnight in any sort of accommodation. If you\\'re looking for a place to camp in a tent, you should not ask to camp, but ask for a place to pitch your tent (carpa).<br>\\n-Speak about the route you are taking in terms of which buses travel on them. Knowledge of highway numbers and names marks the privilege of relatively few Bolivians who own personal vehicles and travel long distances requiring a map. For example, ask city transit to drop you off at the furthest tranca on the route to Cochabamba, don\\'t bother talking about the #1 or the Panamericana.<br>\\n-To that end, know your maps and locations well, because you\\'re on your own with knowing where you want to get. Unlike in North America, you have to do 99% of the navigational work of getting to where you want to do, and convincing someone to take you.<br>\\n-Be conversational in Spanish if expect to arrange any rides.\\n\\n==Western Bolivia==\\n\\nIncluding all parts of the the Andes and the altiplano, and the cities of [[La Paz]], [[Oruro]], [[Uyuni]], and [[Sucre]].\\n\\nThe tiny dirt roads winding in and out of the Andes are in western Bolivia, and the hitching can actually be quite good on them... if you know where to stand. Don\\'t try to stand at the crossings of two roads. Start walking in the direction you\\'re headed, until you\\'re pretty far from anything. Some Bolivians who maybe wouldn\\'t have stopped for you at the crossing may stop for you out in the boonies of the Bolivian mountains. The Bolivian truckers will oftentimes toss you into the back of their cattle truck; make sure you\\'ve got something soft to lie on, because the mountain roads are consistently terrible and the trucks almost never have anything even closely resembling shocks. If you\\'re leaving the mountains, be prepared for a \\'\\'very long ride.\\'\\' [[User:Themodernnomad|themodernnomad]] spent about 3 days getting from Sucre to Vallegrande (roughly 400 kilometres), in a forty year old semi truck that got four flat tires en route.\\n\\nAreas between Oruro, Potosí and Sucre are pretty good and you can make quick time usually for free.\\n\\nHeading from Uyuni to the Chilean border is difficult to nearly impossible. People who do stop tend to ask for more money than the bus costs and there are not many private cars. It is probably better to take a bus.\\n\\n-Trancas (transit parking lots/stopovers) and gas stations are the best places to hitch from -- using a sign won\\'t make sense, so you have to approach people.\\n\\n==Southeastern Bolivia==\\n\\nIncluding [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]] and surrounding areas to the border of Paraguay.\\n\\nSoutheastern Bolivia usually means easier and less miserable rides; the climate is subtropical and warm, and if you\\'ve been spending a lot of time in the altiplano, will be an extremely welcome break from the cold. The roads are a little better, and parts of Santa Cruz are nicer than some Chilean and Argentine cities. Free rides are a little more difficult, but if you wait long enough, someone will give you a free lift. The situation is usually this: Out of ten public transportation vehicles that stop for you, one will take you for free. Fortunately, there are loads of public transportation vehicles in Bolivia, and it takes about 45 minutes for ten to stop for you. Santa Cruz is the richest city in Bolivia and its roads are full of 4x4s and flashy imported cars. Most of those don\\'t seem to venture out of the city, though, and a good percentage has been purchased with drug money. Use your judgment.\\n\\n==Northern Bolivia==\\n\\nAmazonas, including [[Trinidad (Bolivia)|Trinidad]], [[Guayaramerín]], [[Riberalta]], and [[Rurrenabaque]].\\n\\nPerhaps the easiest area to hitchhike, the tropical Bolivian Amazon is crawling with tiny 2-stroke motorcycles and mopeds. They will usually pick you up if they\\'re not loaded down with 4 or 5 people already. Don\\'t bother with the thumb; just wave them down. There are many \\'mototaxis\\' who will want to charge you, but if you find a private citizen, you can get a free lift. A mototaxi may even take you for free if you ask nicely. The climate is sweltering and humid all year around. Bring sunscreen and lots of water.\\n\\n[[File:Mamorèfreighter.jpg\\u200e|right|thumb|200px|Typical Bolivian gasoline freighter on the Río Mamoré, Beni department, Bolivia]]\\n\\nThe roads in northern Bolivia are almost always made of red Amazonian dirt, and are hell in the rainy season. This is why it can sometimes be preferable to travel by river. The easiest route to take by river is Trinidad to Guayaramerín, along the river Mamoré. You will have a hard time finding free passage, but what you can do is work for your trip; gasoline barges and river freighters are always in need of a few extra hands, and many of the capitans will take you in exchange for a little manual labour.\\n\\n[[File:Patrickdepthfinder.jpg\\u200e|left|thumb|250px|[[User:Themodernnomad|themodernnomad]] searching for the bottom of the river with a stick; if he struck bottom, he had to immediately inform the capitan to change course or risk running aground and being yelled at.]]\\n\\nThe type of work you do will vary depending on the season; [[User:Themodernnomad|themodernnomad]] worked for a few weeks in the dry season as a \\'human depth finder\\' with a large stick. The task was to make sure the river was deep enough for the boat to pass since sophisticated equipment such as depth finders are few and far between in Bolivia. You also may have to hose down gas barges to keep them cool, fish, refill 55 gallon drums of diesel fuel, and cook.\\n\\n==Borders==\\n===Entering Bolivia ===\\nEntering Bolivia can be a little bit more difficult than usual.\\nBolivian migration officers are almost guaranteed Angry, so make a careful cost/benefit analysis on whether it\\'s worth the risk not entering the country at all.\\nThey tend to insist that you have an exist stamp in your passport from the country you are coming from.\\nIf you have the stamp in another passport they will probably not let you in. Even if you can show them the other passport.\\nMost immigration offices will ask you to have a paper copy of your passport details, a paper copy of your exist stamp from another country, and lately also a paper copy of your Covid-19 vaccination\\nor PCR. Those copies will stay with them.\\nThey don’t accept you showing them on your phone.\\nMany immigration offices have next to them a copying machine where you can make copies for about 1 boliviano a page.\\nThey also ask you for Email and Phone number, and where are you heading.\\n\\nLater on after you entered, as a foreigner you should fill the information online on where are you spending the night during your stay in Bolivia.\\nSome immigration offices will tell you about it, others don’t.\\nSome police and immigration police will care about it and might even fine you if you didn’t fill the paper others will not care the slightest.\\nTo fill the information you need to enter to Migracion Bolivia web page. http://www.migracion.gob.bo/\\nYou need to press “SISTEMA DE GESTION MIGRATORIA”\\nhttp://sistemas.migracion.gob.bo/sigemig/#/seguridad/login\\nWhich will lead you to your page.\\nPut your password and user name, which are both your passport number.\\nOn the left press the tab “Declaracion”\\nFill the details on where you are staying and dates. Press “Registrar”.\\nThen you need to see that the information was registered in the tab “Historial de Declaracion” and to press confirm.\\nYou need to see the button turns green.\\nYou can put later on different information that contradicts what you originally wrote.\\nIt is normal and can be explained as a change of plan. (according to immigration police)\\nIf you are asked why are you not staying at the information you put online,\\ntell them that your plan changed.\\n\\n=== How long can I stay in Bolivia? ===\\nUpon entering the country, most nationalities (like EU passports) get 30 days. You can try to ask for more, but you won\\'t get more than thirty days. \\nThe Law in Bolivia is messy, and many different immigration offices will act differently according to what they believe is the law.\\n\\nPeople who are citizen of countries in the Mercosur are officially allowed to stay 90 days.\\nIt doesn’t necessarily mean they will get 90 days visa because as said earlier there is a big confusion in the immigracion offices.\\n\\nOther nationalities are divided to 3 different groups.\\nYou should check before arrival in which group your country is.\\n\\nNational of countries in group 3 cannot obtain a visa on arrival and are required to obtain further authorization from a Bolivian embassy or consulate.\\nIn some cases visa on arrival is possible for a higher price.\\n\\nNational of countries in Group 2 must obtain a visa prior to arrival, obtained at any Bolivian embassy or consulate free of charge, or on arrival for a fee.\\n\\nGroup 1 gets  30 days without a fee.\\n\\nIf you whish to extent your stay you need to visit towards the end of the 30 days another immigration office to apply for 30 days more. Each day that you arrive after your 30 days will cost you 28 Bolivianos per day fine (true to August 2022)\\nInsist in the office to get a another 30 days stamp, if you don’t they might charge you for over staying.\\nImmigration offices are set around the country in big cities.\\nMost nationalities can apply for 30 more days twice, 90 days total.\\n\\nImportant to know that many of the people working in the immigration are corrupt and will try to charge you money for something you don’t really owe them.\\nLocals advice to say I only have 20 -50 Bolivianos on me, many times the will just accept it and you can continue like nothing.\\n\\nThey give you a green paper to fill in, of which you get the bottom half and you have to carry this with you until you show up at an exit border. Don\\'t. Lose. It.\\n* Important change.\\nTrue to August 2022 there is no green paper. Didn’t got one myself and asked many travelers\\nand none of them ever got it. Also left the country without anybody asking for it.\\n\\n=== What to do with your coca leafs? ===\\nCoca leaves, the ground product for cocaine, are legal in Bolivia and you\\'ll probably hitch with some drivers with a big ball in their cheek chewing constantly. Though it\\'s from the Andes region, helpful for combating altitude sickness and makes a pretty mean tea, it\\'s not \"legal\" in all countries to carry with and one must be careful with border crossings and it might be wise to give it to another traveler/local or plain dump it (in the trash). As it\\'s both legal (and growing) in Perú and Bolivia, it wasn\\'t an issue to take a full bag of leafs over the border, as experienced by [[User:MOAH|MOAH]] from Bolivia\\'s Copacabana to Perú\\'s Puno at the Titicaca Lake. They didn\\'t check any luggage at all on either side to be honest, so if you really feel the need to smuggle \\'\\'actual\\'\\' contraband like that gram of leftover pot... well... there\\'s still this thing called *common sense*. \\n\\n=== U.S. Citizens ===\\nIf you\\'re anything but a U.S. citizen, entry and exit to Bolivia will be no problem whatsoever (even though some officials still try and extort bribes from travellers). However, if you are a U.S. citizen, you must pay US$135 (2013) to enter the country for 3 months. They are serious about this; in 2010, [[User:Themodernnomad|themodernnomad]] was almost deported for entering the country without first getting a visa.\\n\\n=== To/From [[Paraguay]] ===\\n[This originally appeared on the page of [[Paraguay]] with the directions from Asuncion to Villa Montes, just follow these steps but in opposite order!]\\nThe Gran Chaco area in Paraguay is the most direct route to go to Bolivia, but many people take the route through Argentina due to bad road conditions. If you\\'re hitching the \"Ruta Transchaco\" from the capital Asuncion, it\\'s best to get out of the city with a short distance bus (~2.500 Guaranies =  €0.30) called \"La Chaqueña\" which ends in the town Benjamin Aceval/Cerrito where there\\'s a toll port with some shadow and a few shops to buy water, cigarettes and snacks. You\\'re currently more than 700km from the border to Bolivia and it will be a minimum of three days hitchhiking through sparsely populated areas that get really hot. You can still turn back and go straight before the bridge to Asuncion to cross the border to Argentina. \\n\\nUser [[User:MOAH|MOAH]] hitchhiked in December over the Transchaco from Cerrito to Filadelfia - the biggest hamlet of Gran Chaco, about 400km - in one day and rested between Filadelfia and Cruce de los Pioneros. Already before sundown the darkness comes in the form of threatening mosquito clouds. About 40km of this road is pretty bad, but if you continue north-west you\\'ll soon ask yourself why you thought this was bad. From Filadelfia to Mariscal Estigarribia is about 90 kilometers that can be done fairly smoothly, but here you need to find the Migración office to get your passport stamp to leave Paraguay! The migration office is close to the start of town, so tell your driver you need to get out there. Opening times are variable, so prepare to stay there another night if they\\'re closed. Before you\\'re even thinking of reaching Bolivia, plan this trip carefully so you won\\'t ever have to cross one of these borders on a Sunday (you\\'re royally fucked). There\\'s no ATM\\'s here. \\n\\nFrom Mariscal Estigarribia the road gets even emptier than before. At the end of town is a military base with a shelter on the correct side of the road for shadow and a seat. The next places you can get stuff at have no names on the map, except for La Patria, which is 100km away. The first 10km of road are still like the rest in Paraguay, until suddenly you can deal with a remaining 90km stretch of undodgeable potholes of a road that\\'s only 15 years old. The average speed for trucks is about 15km/h and pick-ups do it with 20 or 25 km/h. The bus (Asuncion - Santa Cruz de la Sierra. No airconditioning) covers this distance in about seven hours, so you\\'ll be happier hitchhiking. On average the third pick-up would stop. Places to get water at ar scarce, so take at the very least three litres with you before you go and fill that up whenever you can. \\n\\nLa Patria has shops and (shitty) accomodation and from here the road will be fine again till inside Bolivia. Its 116km to the border, which has a 6km no man\\'s land in between you honestly don\\'t want to walk. From La Patria there\\'s nothing till the border besides some ranches, and truck drivers were very reluctant to pick up hitchhikers in this direction, probably because they\\'re scared - something with drugs or whatever. It\\'s very likely that your average pick-up driver has a shotgun or other hunting rifle - whether that\\'s for protection or assault is up for discussion. Pick-ups drive about 90km/h here so you\\'ll be fast! \\n\\nAt the border there\\'s nothing except for men with guns in fancy uniforms being braindead bored. You don\\'t get your Bolivian stamp here either, that\\'s in the next town 50km away called Ibibobo. At the border you can get drinkable ground water from a little tap outside the \"Aduana\" building on the Bolivian side. It\\'s warm, but it will help you survive. Find a tree and wait until a truck moves in the right direction or go around and ask. You might wait three hours before you see something moving as there is 1) very little traffic 2) a lot of bureaucracy for truck drivers to finally pass. If you\\'re lucky, there might be a pick-up from Bolivia driving back to civilization 100km away to a town called Villa Montes (ATMs, hostels, WiFi!!!), but don\\'t forget to get your stamp at the perpetually angry guys in Ibibobo, well-indicated as another \"Migracion\". \\n\\nNow you have to deal with the fact that your exit stamp from Paraguay is already a few days old and where you\\'ve been in the meantime? User [[User:MOAH|MOAH]] said that from Mariscal Estigarribia the bus wouldn\\'t take her because it was too crowded all the time, so she was \"forced\" to hitchhike - it worked! In the daytime there\\'s people exchanging Guaraní, Dollars, Euros, Reaís and what not at Ibibobo and one can get soup, cookies and soft drinks here, but that\\'s really it. There\\'s a military check point about 500 meters from the Migracion where folks in uniform might ask you to show your passport but other than that, hitchhiking shouldn\\'t be a big deal here, except for very low traffic. It\\'s still more than 50km to Villa Montes, but at least now you\\'ve legally entered the Plurinational State of Bolivia!\\n\\nMoral of the story: for hitchhiking Gran Chaco, bring a hat, enough, food, water, cash, sunscreen and mosquito repellant and a healthy dose of skepticism. Never do anything important on a Sunday.\\n\\nUser [[User:Spokojna Woda|Spokojna Woda]]: as of 2025 the info above is out of date. The border control is done on the border, and you don\\'t need to get your stamp in Ibibobo. The road between Villamontes and La Patria in Paraguay is 100% paved and in good shape. Remember, that foot passengers and cars can cross the border only until 6 pm and not on Sundays.\\n\\n=== To/From [[Peru]] ===\\n*Copacabana - Puno*\\nWARNING: avoid Copacabana at all costs during any public holiday, especially if you\\'re dependent on hostels and can\\'t go camping. All of La Paz flocks to the lake on (long) weekends especially around Christmas and NYE. There\\'s about 50 \"hostales\" and they manage to get all of them full. Even fast food takes an hour during holidays.\\nFrom the occasionally extortionately priced town of Copacabana (which is actually the \"original\" Copacabana if you have a Trivia night) you have to get to the border town of Kasani 12 km south, which passes the Copacabana airport. You can hitch there or say fuck it and take the 3 Boliviano micro (which is 2 for locals/non gringos). The Migración office is on your right hand now and you have to have your passport and green paper (sucks if you lost it, I don\\'t know the consequences of this but it probably involves a bribe) ready for the angry men. Should take one minute to check out of Bolivia if you manage to answer questions correctly and not piss off anyone in the process. Hurrah! Now you have to walk 300 meters past the church the Perú statue and you\\'ll find the Peruvian office on your right hand too. Again, you\\'ll have to fill in a form that you have to carry with you during your entire stay like upon entering Bolivia. These guys were friendly, which probably has something to do with the fact that they have a nicer building to perform their job in. The first town on the Peruvian side is named Yunguyo and you\\'re about 2 km away from it. You can get a 2 Soles micro there or walk to the end of it to get to hitch to Puno, which is really easy though it\\'s still 120 km away! As experienced by [[User:MOAH|MOAH]], hitchhiking in Perú is a fucking breeze compared to Bolivia.\\n\\n* Puno – Desaguadero – La Paz\\nThe region in this area both in Peru and Bolivia is called the Alto Plano,\\nIt basically means that it is very high and more or less flat.\\nWe are talking about more than 4000 meters high, so basically there isn’t so much oxygen\\nWhich can lead to a constant headache, and doing simple tasks can feel tiring.\\nAfter awhile you get use to it but it’s important to mention.\\nIt is also relatively very cold all year long, and in the rainy season you can find your tent sitting all of a sudden in a paddle. So be careful not to camp in flat areas that rain drains to.\\nHitchhiking by it self is not so hard, but it’s also not super good.\\nYou’ll need to cross two big cities, Puno and La Paz, which is always not so easy for hitchhikers.\\nSome parts of the road don’t have much movement especially on Sunday’s and especially close to the border. In overall it is not super easy but certainly doable.\\nThe crossing in Desaguadero is not too difficult.\\nThere are few bridges that cross the river, some of them are closed for civilians.\\nThe most northern one is the normal crossing.\\nIf you go by the river people with small boats will offer you to take you the other side for a small payment. Don’t do it if you wish to stay legal.\\nThe immigration office is close to the crossing of the bridge in both sides.\\nYou’ll have to enter the buildings and wait in a line sometimes.\\nFor SonOfaHitch it went really smooth. Few questions like how long you are going to stay,\\nDo you have Covid Vaccination which they barely checked. And that’s it\\nNo luggage check or anything in both sides.\\n\\n=== To/From [[Chile]] ===\\n*Colchane - Pisica\\nFrom Iquique, in Chile, you have to reach Huara on the road 5 in the direction of Arica. In Huara, there\\'s a paved road that goes directly in Bolivia in Oruro. The border is between Coclchane (Chile) and Pisica (Bolivia). To leave Chile or Bolivia you need the paper they gave you while entering the country. There are many trucks on this road that goes from the harbor in Iquique to Oruro in Bolivia.\\nWhen going from Chile to Bolivia the PDI and Policia boliviana are in the same house, rigth at the border between the city of Colchane and Pisica. Checking out and checking in are in the same room. You can change Euros, Dollars, Bolivianos or Pesos Chilenos and buy food. Be warned from the cold, if the days may be sunny and quite hot, the nights there (at 3700m) may be very cold.\\n\\n\\n=== To/From [[Argentina]] ===\\n*Villazon - La Quiaca\\nYou can reach Villazon from Uyuni or Potosí by the road. The border crossing is right between the two cities, near the bridge that crosses the river. While leaving Bolivia you will be asked the paper they gave you entering the country. Entering Argentina a police officer may open your backpack and ask a few questions. You are allowed to enter Jujuy the northerner state of Argentina with 500g of coca leaves. They are legal in the two states of Jujuy and Salta in Argentina. Villazon is quite a big city you\\'ll find anything in the market there. The city of La Quiaca is much smaller and you can cross it walking, leaving towards the south with the road nine that crosses the country till [[Buenos Aires]].\\n\\n*Yacuiba - Salvador Mazza\\nHitchhiking from Bolivia to Yacuiba to the border is kind of easy. On the Argentinian side it is a little bit emptier and harder.\\nYacuiba is quite large, So if you don\\'t wish to walk a lot you can take a bus that gets close to the border.\\nThe Bolivian Side might ask for Covid papers and so on. They might make some problems. Keep calm, know your rights and you’ll probably cross very fast to the other side.\\nOn the Argentinian side they scan your bag, and you don\\'t get a stamp because it is online this days.\\nThey might ask you if you have hotel reservations. after few Kilometers into Argentina there is a Police roadblock.\\n\\n===To/From [[Brazil]]===\\n* Cobija – Brasileia\\nHitchhiking in Bolivia to the border is quite easy. Just be careful from muddy roads.\\nIf it gets rainy many vehicles will struggle to cross the way.\\nHitchhiking in Brazil to the border is a bit more difficult but possible.\\nIf you came from Peru hitchhiking usually takes a very short time.\\nBut if you coming from other places it can be a bit more challenging,\\nbut certainly possible.\\n\\nThe crossing between this two cities is very easy.\\nThey are separated by a river that have many bridge crossings.\\nYou will almost never be asked anything when you cross.\\nYou can go from Brazil to Bolivia with barely anybody talking to you.\\nAs the rumors say, You can spend the day in the other side for the day,\\nBut at the evening legally you should go back to the side where you are stamped.\\nUsually nobody will check either way.\\n\\nIf you wish to cross the border and get stamped you should search for the Immigration on both side.\\nThere are set in Brazil at -11.029337,-68.740088 (Google Maps) and in Bolivia at -11.026769,-68.752186 (Google Maps).\\nIt’s important to get stamped also in the country that you are leaving in order to avoid fines in case you ever come back. Theoretically if you leave a country without getting stamped they consider it like you never left. And when you wish to enter again the country in the future they will charge you for any other day pass your visa time until the date you re-entered.\\nThe fine in Bolivia for example is 28 Bolivianos (about 4 US Dollars 2022) a day of over staying.\\nIf you came back to the country before your visa expired you shouldn’t have any problem.\\n\\n* Guaraja-mirim – Guayaramerin\\nHitchhiking in Bolivia to the border is quite easy. Just be careful from muddy roads.\\nIf it gets rainy many vehicles will struggle to cross the way.\\nHitchhiking in Brazil to the border is a bit more difficult but possible.\\n\\nYou can freely cross between the two cities, Guaraja mirim and Guayaramerin.\\nThe crossing costs 13 Brazilian reals or 20 Bolivian Bolivianos (true for July 2022).\\nIt takes only few short minutes to cross when the boat leaves.\\nPeople say that there is some boats on the river that will charge even less.\\n\\nIf you wish to continue your travels legally beyond the city in the other country you crossed to you should get your passport stamped.\\n\\nFor exiting Brazil you should go to the immigration office which is located not so close to the port, In \"Justiça Federal Subsecção De Guajará Mirim\" (-10.783061,-65.317563 Google maps).\\nThey are open from 8:00 -18:00 but not every day.\\nI came on a sunday and had to wait for another day. I\\'m not sure if it\\'s every sunday or that I just had bad luck.\\nThe proccess over there was quite easy.\\nNo papers or documents were asked beside my passport.\\nIn about 15 minutes got my exit stamp and continued.\\n\\nFor entering Brazil I\\'m assuming you\\'ll have to go the same place, but maybe good you ask the people in the Brazilian port. The taxi drivers usually know.\\n\\nIn Bolivia the immigration office is just where the boat drops you.\\nThey ask for photo copies of your passport and the stamp of leaving Brazil. \\nThey also want your covid vaccination passport two dosages or a negative Covid test from the last days in paper (on your phone does not count).\\nYou need just one of the two. (Again true for July 2022)\\nThere is a photo copy in the coffee place next by. It costs 1 Boliviano per page. But they don\\'t have a printer, in case you want to print some documents from your phone.\\nI paid a motor taxi to take me to a place with a printer.\\nPassed them the Covid passport with Bluetooth and came back.\\nCost me 11 Bolivianos in total, 10 for the taxi 1 for the paper.\\nLater they asked me for my phone and where do i go.\\nTold \"La Paz\" and my number and got 30 days visa which i can extend in other migration offices when time comes.\\n\\n== Cities ==\\n* [[Cochabamba]]\\n* [[Copacabana]]\\n* [[La Paz]]\\n* [[Oruro]]\\n* [[Potosí]]\\n* [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]]\\n* [[Sucre]]\\n* [[Tarija]]\\n* [[Trinidad (Bolivia)|Trinidad]]\\n\\n== Experiences ==\\n<i> Here is a short anlysing of hitchhiking in Bolivia by [[User:Korn|Korn]] on [https://warmroads.de/en/hitchhiking-in-11-bolivia/ - warmroads.]\\n\\n\\n<i>\"Bolivia is a rapidly changing country, and with Evo\\'s third term as president about to begin, one can expect the trend to continue. One of the big focuses of the current government is a massive expansion of infrastructure and this includes the widening and paving of highways. So people\\'s stories from Bolivia will likely quite rapidly grow outdated. At present, most highways alternate between asphalt and dirt or cobblestone, so be prepared for a smooth ride to turn bumpy, especially when in the back of a truck. In our experience, Bolivia was not particularly difficult to hitch, even when exiting cities, though inside cities it proved virtually impossible much of the time (as is the case in most places). Wait times were usually only long in low-traffic rural areas where very few vehicles would pass, but in those scenarios, when one came they stopped more than 50% of the time. An ability to speak in Spanish and a map or knowledge of your route seems crucial for hitching in Bolivia, because as described in the beginning of this page, most people speak only Spanish and are generally terrible with directions. We began every exchange by saying up front that we had no money (No tenemos plata... ¿está bien?) and never paid for a single ride. This was almost always fine with every driver (except most taxis, though even some taxis would still help us out) and avoided any awkward scenarios down the road. As explained above, it is customary, especially with trucks, to pay the driver a small amount - 3 to 10 Bolivianos - upon disembarking, so it\\'s important to work that out ahead of time, especially if you can\\'t pay. [I\\'ll add more info later when I have time.]\"</i> - [[User:jhoule|jhoule]], hitching in October-November 2014\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'Altough I found the hitching difficult, I crossed Bolivia for a total of about $10, which I made playing the harmonica on the streets.

The hitchhiking is medium to good, depending on the region, the people are extremely friendly, and the country is easily the cheapest in South America\\'\\' -[[User:Themodernnomad|themodernnomad]] \\n\\n\\n\\'\\'May/ August 2014 -   I hitchhiked in both parts of Bolivia, i.e. Occidental and Oriental, and it really is like chalk and cheese, or campa e colla as the locals say. On the mountainous West, a bus really is probably a more wise option. The locals tend not to be warm, receptive or curious about hitchhikers, with some exceptions. A bus out of La Paz, and then hitching on the main highways would work. Truckers will pick you up, as they often come from more friendly states. I got rides out of Titicaca and a few others, but with white lies about thefts, which I never feel easy using. \\'\\'\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'3 months later, a little scarred, I entered the Oriental lowlands, which was vastly easier. Most of the times I was picked up by the very ride. Easy peasey! I took a route up through the Jesuit Ruins, for a dash of culture, very easy to hitch, and a few taxi drivers will take you for free if you blether away and entertain them with stories. You wont make the same grade of connections with your hitches on the whole, like in Argentina and Chile, but it was much easier than I anticipated. To crown it, getting free passage on a petrol barge to Brazil was a piece of cake, not even having to work for it. Slept in many shop fronts, and sometimes near police stations. But in the country, it is quite safe\\'\\' - [[User:lukeyboy95|lukeyboy95]] \\n\\n\\nI´m hitchhiking at the moment in Bolivia, and just discover that it exist a map of all the spots of the toll in the country.

They took my bag for a quick search found 20 dollars among the dirty clothes and tarp (pretty much all I had valuable was the 20 dollars) and pocketed it. Unimpressed I walked on along the dirt road and caught a lift soon enough with a local guy to La Paz. Be careful with the food and water in Bolivia, I spent a day or two sick on the toilet after taking some tap water (unintentionally, I think it was the lemonade at a restaurant), I opted to get a bus for very cheap to Tarija then since I was a bit weak for hitchhiking. After the day on the bus though I felt better and hit the road for a bit around Tarija and found it doable to get lifts, truck drivers being the best as there is little traffic and many unmarked taxi cars, and then hitchhiked on to Argentina. I would consider my attempt to hitchhike across Bolivia failed if I\\'m honest mainly because I wasn\\'t careful enough with the police and the food, people are nice there though.\\'\\' - \\n[[User:HoboSpirit|HoboSpirit]]\\n\\n\\n“I traveled Bolivia from July to August 2022.\\nIn general it was a good experience but also kind of weird.\\n\\nI actually didn’t officially hitchhike for the whole route I’ve done from Guayamerin to Desaguadero Peru. But I also didn’t pay anything.\\nWhile I was in the north of the country I started walking towards my destination.\\nAnd a police stopped me and said “hey, don’t walk! Where are you going? I’ll get you a ride”\\nlike that I just continued my travel. And almost always somebody shortly stopped me and offered me a ride or at least offered me to find me one.

I climbed down one side of la Paz and up the other side, heading to death rd, then back again in 2017 because I thought the gondola was expensive. In 2024 I used gondola as I found out one way ticket was 3 bolivianos (30 US cents)\\n\\nin 2024 i started off in Cobija, where i camped the night next to a military base, right next to the border. \\xa0big mistake as they played full blast heavy base music until 4am. \\xa0Next day i went to cambio and changed at rate of 9 bolivianos to 1 usd. \\xa0Afterwards, i hitched to El Triangulo same day, pretty good going considering majority is rough dirt road. \\xa0then over the next 2 days i hitched to La Paz spotting many cayman and beaver looking animals beside the highway. \\xa0i only got asked for money once, but i refused as i was sitting in the boot and got quite dusty. I visited and hiked Huayna Potosi. \\xa0Then I hitched to Cochabamba easily. \\xa0Between there and Santa Cruz it got very slow going so had to take several cheap buses. When I got to Mataral, i took the highway 22 as a shortcut to Ipita (very rough unpaved road), but that was a big mistake as i ended up negotiating a taxi to take me half way (20 bolivianos), followed by a 30km walk, where i was picked up by couple to a small village and they gave me 100 bolivianos (maybe wasn\\'t so bad route after all). \\xa0i then waited 5 hours for a single car to go past and they thankfully stopped, took me to Ipita and treated me to dinner. \\xa0Then i got picked up within 20 minutes by 3 argentinan looking middle aged women who wanted me to come and party with them for 2 days, but i had to make ground, so they dropped me off at Morevita, where within minutes a bus came and stopped and offered to take me to Yacuiba for 70 bolivianos. i took it and when i arrived i camped in bushes behind a gas station. \\xa0Next morning i walked to border visiting several cambio on-route and exchanged at rate of 1280 argentina pesos for 1 usd. \\xa0i saw no cambio on argentina side.

It is situated between the Appennines and the river Po in the north of Italy. The city is home of the oldest university in the world. There are now over 100 000 students.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== Towards all directions ===\\n\\nThere is a service station near Cantagallo. Take the bus #20B to its last station \"San Biagio\". There you walk 200 metres until you reach the fences of the service station. Another option to get there is to take the bus #20 to \\'\\'Casalecchio\\'\\' (departs at \\'\\'Via dell Indipendenza\\'\\'). There change the bus or take the bus #89 and go to its last station called \\'\\'San Biagio\\'\\'. There you walk 200 metres until you reach the fences of the service station. [If you get off two stations before the last station (at the station called San Biagio Micca; just after the bridge over the highway), than you have less to walk.]\\n\\nNormally you can\\'t enter the service station. There are fences you can\\'t cross. But there is a little parking lot of the service station staff. You can ring there and maybe they will open you. If not, at the service station on the other side of the motorway there is a little hole in the fence, where you can enter.\\n\\n\\n=== Heading North (Genova, Milano, Parma etc.) ===\\n\\nIf you\\'re heading north (Genova, Milano, Parma etc.), get off the bus at Casalecchio C.S. Allende. Cross the road, follow the path off the main road, then turn right - there\\'s a parking lot and the entrance to the service station. It was closed when we came, but the staff was friendly and opened the door for us on condition that we wouldn\\'t tell anyone that they did it.\\n\\nIf you\\'re heading south (Florence, Rome etc.), get off at San Biagio and go to the right along the motorway. There\\'s some sort of park there, and in the end there\\'s a place where you cross the railway and reach the fence of the service station. Go further to the right along the service station, and around the corner there\\'re stairs going up to the service station with no fences.\\n\\nIf you walk around the side of the fence you will find a small gate. It was open when we went, but anyway it is very low and easy to climb over. This takes you straight into the service area\\n\\nCrossing the motorway outside the service station is a bit difficult. You can try it under the motorway through the building site, but it is muddy. It is easier to get off the bus #89 one stop before, before it crosses the motorway. The name of the stop is: Casalecchio C.s. Allende.\\n\\nOnce you are inside the service station, you can cross the motorway easily. Enter the building and go up on the stairs to the restaurant. Now go down on the other side of the motorway. Attention: You are not able to cross the motorway in the morning, because the restaurant is closed. But if you have luck, the barmen will help you.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Ferrara]], [[Padova]] and [[Venice]] on A13 ===\\nYou have to get to the first service area on the motorway about 20 kms from the centre. It is called \\'\\'Castel Bentivoglio\\'\\'. There is a bus stop close by, called \\'\\'Bentivoglio Zona industriale Barche\\'\\' (often abbreviated like \\'\\'Bentivoglio Z. i. Barche\\'\\'). Some of the bus lines only go few times a day, mainly in the morning and evening, taking (very helpful) workers to work and back home. Easiest is to take #446 to Soletto which goes directly from the Bologna central bus station 4-6 times a day. It takes 30min (timetable [http://www.atc.bo.it/orari_percorsi/linee/pdf/atc_01376.pdf]). You can also use the route planner of the Bologna public transport company here: [http://www.atc.bo.it/orari_percorsi/planner/plannerEN.asp]. For the arrival town, put \\'\\'Bentivoglio\\'\\', for the stop: \\'\\'Bentivoglio Z. i. Barche\\'\\'.\\n\\nFrom the bus stop, you take the road parallel to the motorway. You pass some factories, the motorway should be behind them. After 500 m there is a crossroad to the right. The service area is just at the end of it. There is a fence, but I had no problem of getting in, the door was open. If it is closed, you can try to ring or ask for the help of the \\'locals\\'.\\n\\n=== Going to and from the Airport ===\\n\\nActually you are supposed to take the BLQ Airport Express bus to and from the Airport towards Bologna main station. But it costs 5 Euros, which is a lot compared to any normal bus ticket, which costs you just 1 Euro. So, instead of taking the Express bus, take buses #91 and #81 from the main station and get off at stop \"Birra\". It is the last urban area before you cross the motorway to get to the airport.\\nObtain the 1€ ticket in advance @ the tabac as you may not do it while entering the bus #91, #81. There is also a supermarket \"Conad\" right next to the stop & small fenced park allowing you to rest in a shade. To get to the Airport will take you 15 minutes by foot from there, pavements are provided the whole way. Just follow the direction the bus goes and you cannot miss it. Stick to the left side of the road. To get there FROM the airport is quite easy if you have a map, if you do not you may get it free at the airport tourist information (together with may other useful info end even exact map of the region of Emilia-Romania). \\nFrom the arrival hall head straight ahead. Cross the round-about with a city center marks visible and follow it. Then the pavement path turns right and leads you under the motorway bridge. from there you may already some buildings 100 m. away. Go towards them.  \\nThe mentioned busses run from the morning until 8 p.m.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|Italy}}\\n\\n[[Category:Italy]]\\n[[Category:E35]]\\n[[Category:E45]]\\n[[fr: Bologne]]',\n",

Lots of traffic there. From the main station take the line #66 direction \\'\\'Siegburg Bahnhof\\'\\'. \\n* \\'\\'\\'short walking connection:\\'\\'\\' Take the bus #509 (only runs 1 time per hour) direction \\'\\'Lange Lindenstrasse\\'\\'. Get off at \\'\\'Bernhardstraße\\'\\'. Walk \\'\\'Alte Poststrasse\\'\\' along uphill, all the way to the petrol station. it\\'s about 5 to 10 minutes walk (for direction North get over the walkbridge).\\n* \\'\\'\\'frequent connection:\\'\\'\\' Buses 510, 511, 576 and 577 are going more frequent. Get off at \"Schwimmbad\". Walk 20 meters back, walk down \"Am Stadion\" on the right and then \"Bernhardstraße\" until \"Alte Poststrasse\".\\n\\nAnother possibility, far easier to reach but less ideal in terms of finding the right lift, is the Shell petrol station on the St. Augustinerstraße. Take the same line #66 as above, but get out at station Adelheidisstraße, the fourth stop after the main station. Walk back 50m on the side of the road heading out of Bonn (there are petrol stations in both directions). There will be lots of local visitors, check out the number plates filtering out those with \\'BN\\' or \\'SU\\' because these are from Bonn and Siegburg, respectively. They might go out in A3 direction, but less probably so than other plates. Ask if people are heading for A3 and if you could be taken to a petrol station there. A station on the A59 will do fine too.\\n\\nIf you are not sure about in which side you should wait, the side on Bonn is to the south. Asking the employees in the gas station where to stand may not be helpful as mostly they don\\'t have any idea and this can cost you time.\\n\\n=== South (B9, [[Remagen]], [[Andernach]], [[Koblenz]], [[Mainz]]) ===\\nFrom the center walk to the \\'\\'Adenauerallee\\'\\' which leads into the \\'\\'Friedrich-Ebert-Allee\\'\\', you are already on the B9, you can hitch from every possible spot here, where a car is able to stop. You won\\'t get very long rides, but if you want to go to Koblenz or Mainz, it is the better choice to hitch this [[national road]]. Aware, the road is mostly two-laned, so make sure you will get dropped in a [[Where to hitchhike|save spot]] (Remagen, or Bad Breisig) where the road is interrupted by traffic lights and where are bus stops where you can hitch on further.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Cologne|Köln]], [[Oberhausen]] & North-East towards [[Dortmund]], [[Hannover]] ===\\nFor the directions of North and North-East you can use the same options described at the section above on \\'South towards Frankfurt\\'. The Siegburg petrol station on the A3 has stations on both sides which are connected via a pedestrian bridge. Also the second option described about the station at Augustinerstrasse can get you north and south.\\n\\nThe Siegburg petrol station is extensively used by Dutchmen to get back to the Netherlands, so this is also a good place to get a shot at the Low Countries.\\n\\nMind that Köln (Cologne) is part of the same metropolitan area as Bonn and is connected via public transportation. Once on A3, ask for lifts to Oberhausen, because getting to Köln itself is of no use.\\n\\nIf you are heading towards the North-East to reach the A1 to continue towards Dortmund or further towards the A2 heading to Hannover, you should start at the above mentioned petrol station of Siegburg. You should aim to get a ride to the petrol station on the A1 at Remscheid. Getting into this direction is a challenge, for most people who use the petrol station at Siegburg are coming from the Frankfurt region, which has the A45 to their disposal to reach Dortmund, however there should be sufficient amount of rides towards Wuppertal to get you there. \\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n[[Category:North Rhine-Westphalia]]\\n[[Category:Germany]]\\n\\n[[de:Bonn]]',\n",

It\\'s the capital city of the [[Aquitaine]] region.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\nBordeaux is encircled by a ring road (\\'\\'rocade\\'\\' in french), a fast dual-carriageway bypass, with no places to stop and pick up hitchhikers, and peages are far and not easy to reach by walking or public transport. This makes leaving Bordeaux very tricky, although not impossible. It is best to hitchhike on the approach roads to the ring road in the direction you wish to travel. It is advised to avoid going into the town centre.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Tours]], [[Paris]] ===\\n\\nTotal gas station on the ring road\\n\\nTake the tram A to Gravières stop. Follow the street Rue des Gravières/Rue François Villon which is on the right hand side just before the tram arrives at the stop from the city centre. At a big crossroad, go left down the big crossing road named Avenue de Paris. There is a small road parallel of this street in the industrial estate, take it (rue Jean Raymond Guyon). It ends to a roundabout but here is a small old pedestrian road. Take it. Cross the bridge that crosses the motorway. From it, you can see two Total gas station on different sides of the road. The fences are broken so you can walk easily to the furthest one away for the North (Paris, etc.)\\n\\nAsk for going to the next BP gas station, just before “Saint André de Cubzac” if nobody takes the A10. At the next petrol station, there is a restaurant, so a lot more people.\\n\\nFor the south one can use the first service station seen from the pedestrian bridge.\\n\\n=== East towards Perigeux, [[Clermont-Ferrand]], [[Lyon]] ===\\n\\nA big outward road leads from the city center over bridges over the Dordogne, over the ring motorway and later becomes the motorway A 89 (E 70) to the east. Shortly after it crosses the ring there is a good spot: There is a junction, where all the eastbound traffic from the ring joins. One may ask waiting drivers at the traffic lights or stand beside the road after that, because it is not a motorway yet. Drivers can see you there and go slow because normally everyone has to stop at the traffic lights, and there is a broad hard shoulder and bus stops, where one can safely stop and continue. A few hundred meters further there is also a small dedicated fStation Carrefour Lormont Fuel station on that road\\n\\nTo get there on public transit, take the purple line A (both lines to Dravemont or La Gardette bassens work) from the city center to the stop Buttinière. The line follows a big avenue (Avenue Carnot) for roughly 3km. At Buttinière you get out and walk along that same Avenue Carnot for another 1-1.5km passing on your left first the Polyclinique de Bordeaux then a gigantic Carrefour supermarket and stop lights. \\n\\n=== South towards [[Bayonne]], [[Toulouse]], [[Barcelona]] ([[Spain]]) ===\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\' Total gas station on the ring road\\n\\nTake the tram A to Gravières stop.

For the south one can use the first service station seen from the pedestrian bridge.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nCloser to the entrance of the highway. Take the bus #15 towards \"Villenave d\\'Ornon\" and exit at \"Pont de la Maye\" (you can ask the bus driver to tell you when it is). Then, walk in the same direction that the bus went, on the road. Cross the bridge above the road. Just after the bridge there is a little grassy hill on the right. Walk down the hill. You\\'ll arrive on a roundabout with a road going directly to A62 ([[Toulouse]]). There is some space on the roundabout so the cars can stop and pick you up relatively easily. \\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nYou can take the tram B towards Pessac Centre and get off at Montaigne-Montesquieu stop. Then you can walk through the Ecole D\\'architecture university to this spot: [https://www.google.pt/maps/place/Ecole+d\\'Architecture/@44.7919076,-0.6069205,17.25z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0xd55277ca268f08f:0x4587fa5100d62492!2sCours+de+la+Lib%C3%A9ration,+Gradignan,+Francia!3b1!8m2!3d44.7911157!4d-0.6053846!3m4!1s0xd54d8a1e50ab175:0x406a7ebaf423b00d!8m2!3d44.7927729!4d-0.6052592?hl=es see map].

Follow the street Rue des Gravières/Rue François Villon which is on the right hand side just before the tram arrives at the stop from the city centre. At a big crossroad, go left down the big crossing road named Avenue de Paris. There is a small road parallel of this street in the industrial estate, take it (rue Jean Raymond Guyon). It ends to a roundabout but here is a small old pedestrian road. Take it. Cross the bridge that crosses the motorway. From it, you can see two Total gas station on different sides of the road. The fences are broken so you can walk easily to the furthest one away for the North (Paris, etc.)\\n\\nAsk for going to the next BP gas station, just before “Saint André de Cubzac” if nobody takes the A10. At the next petrol station, there is a restaurant, so a lot more people.\\n\\nFor the south one can use the first service station seen from the pedestrian bridge.\\n\\n=== East towards Perigeux, [[Clermont-Ferrand]], [[Lyon]] ===\\n\\nA big outward road leads from the city center over bridges over the Dordogne, over the ring motorway and later becomes the motorway A 89 (E 70) to the east. Shortly after it crosses the ring there is a good spot: There is a junction, where all the eastbound traffic from the ring joins. One may ask waiting drivers at the traffic lights or stand beside the road after that, because it is not a motorway yet. Drivers can see you there and go slow because normally everyone has to stop at the traffic lights, and there is a broad hard shoulder and bus stops, where one can safely stop and continue. A few hundred meters further there is also a small dedicated fStation Carrefour Lormont Fuel station on that road\\n\\nTo get there on public transit, take the purple line A (both lines to Dravemont or La Gardette bassens work) from the city center to the stop Buttinière. The line follows a big avenue (Avenue Carnot) for roughly 3km. At Buttinière you get out and walk along that same Avenue Carnot for another 1-1.5km passing on your left first the Polyclinique de Bordeaux then a gigantic Carrefour supermarket and stop lights. \\n\\n=== South towards [[Bayonne]], [[Toulouse]], [[Barcelona]] ([[Spain]]) ===\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\' Total gas station on the ring road\\n\\nTake the tram A to Gravières stop. Follow the street Rue des Gravières/Rue François Villon which is on the right hand side just before the tram arrives at the stop from the city centre. At a big crossroad, go left down the big crossing road named Avenue de Paris. There is a small road parallel of this street in the industrial estate, take it (rue Jean Raymond Guyon). It ends to a roundabout but here is a small old pedestrian road. Take it. Cross the bridge that crosses the motorway. From it, you can see two Total gas station on different sides of the road. For the south one can use the first service station seen from the pedestrian bridge.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nCloser to the entrance of the highway. Take the bus #15 towards \"Villenave d\\'Ornon\" and exit at \"Pont de la Maye\" (you can ask the bus driver to tell you when it is). Then, walk in the same direction that the bus went, on the road. Cross the bridge above the road. Just after the bridge there is a little grassy hill on the right. Walk down the hill. You\\'ll arrive on a roundabout with a road going directly to A62 ([[Toulouse]]). There is some space on the roundabout so the cars can stop and pick you up relatively easily. \\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nYou can take the tram B towards Pessac Centre and get off at Montaigne-Montesquieu stop. Then you can walk through the Ecole D\\'architecture university to this spot: \\'\\'see map\\'\\' {{Coords|44.7919076|-0.6069205|1}}. The cars there will most probably take the A63 that goes south. There is a bus stop (Ecole d\\'architecture) where you can stand with a sign and the cars will have space to stop and don\\'t go very fast. You can choose a bus stop Ecole de Management, which is just before university\\n\\n\\n== Public transport ==\\n\\nIn the tramway, there are very few controls, but there is no way to avoid the control when it happens.

If it\\'s been a while and you still haven\\'t found a ride, try asking people for \"Sekule\" - this is the last gas station before the Czech border, so everyone stops here to get vignettes (highway stickers).\\n\\nThere are two options how to get there: Get off at bus stop called \\'\\'Húščavova\\'\\'. The bus stop is directly after the bus turns left and crosses the highway over a bridge. You need to indicate that you want to get off the bus at this station. In the worst case though, you can get off at the next stop \\'\\'Lipského\\'\\' and walk a bit more. When you leave the bus just walk back over the bridge and turn left and walk to the next traffic light to the station. Or get off at bus stop called \\'\\'Pridánky\\'\\'. You need to indicate that you want to get off the bus. Once you leave the bus, the service station is very close but not visible. Follow the direction in which the bus continues for 100 meters and you will see the exit of the highway and the service station on your left.\\n\\n==== Mokrohájska ====\\n\\nGo to a bus stop called \\'\\'Mokrohájska\\'\\', the bus stop is on city road in Brno direction but it\\'s not yet a highway. You can try hitch hiking directly \\'behind\\' the bus stop, there\\'s enough for car to stop or continue walking in the same direction the bus was going, about 300 meters further there\\'s a large OMV gas station, McDonald\\'s and non-stop Tesco shopping mall. You also can try to hitchhike on traffic lights nearby.\\n\\n\\n=== East towards [[Žilina]] {{European Route Number|75}}, [[Banská Bystrica]], {{European Route Number|58}} {{European Route Number|571}} (D1) ===\\n\\n====Zlaté Piesky gas station====\\n\\nThere is a gas station directly on the D1 highway in Bratislava, near the AVION shopping centre. Take bus 61 in the direction of the airport and get off at the stop \\'\\'Fatruny\\'\\'. You can try either hitchhiking on the on-ramp or asking drivers at the gas station 750\\xa0m from the bus stop. It\\'s bit harder to get in to gas station, you have to walk past highway for a while. There are a lot of trucks going by this on-ramp, because this is one of the industrial parts of Bratislava. \\n\\n====Zlaté Piesky bus stop====\\n\\nTake a tram 2 or 4 east to the last stop called \\'\\'Zlaté Piesky\\'\\'. Cross over the big road to your right and walk down past the Porsche dealership. Hitchhike on the highway just beyond the bus stop. Its not the greatest spot, but there isn\\'t any other. The road splits into the E75 and the E58/E571 approximately 30 km east from here.\\n\\n\\n=== South towards [[Budapest]] {{European Route Number|75}}, [[Vienna]] {{European Route Number|58}} ===\\n\\n====Vyšehradská gas station====\\n\\nThe most traffic but it\\'s hard to get there: This is a big gas station on the D2 highway south of the city. Go by bus 93 or 95 to the bus stop Vyšehradská (It is the last stop of the bus 93), Cross the big road called Panonská Cesta and walk to the gas station. It\\'s a quite walk to get there. [http://goo.gl/maps/QWXe Here is a map]. Stefan (June \\'16) is not sure if that walking path is correct in that map. He walked an other (longer) way: [https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1vgETn-PcvwwOun3yBK4CHTaTTa4]. \\n\\nMost cars  cars are either heading into Vienna or back to Bratislava from this location. If you\\'re looking at heading into Budapest from here ask people, if they going in the direction of HU, Györ is good as well. There is a gas station further along on the M1, a little after the first exit for Gyor, from which you\\'ll be able to catch a lift to Budapest in no time. With patience, you can find a driver for Gyor to lead you until Gyor’s gas station where you find a second driver to Budapest in less than 5 minutes!\\n\\n====Walking towards Vienna====\\n\\nFollowing highway B9 parallel to the Danube walk towards Vienna with your thumb out. The traffic is slow and light enough that people can stop and pick you up easily. \\n\\n====Einsteinova bus station====\\n\\nWalk south over the UFO bridge and follow the pedestrian/cycle path to the right. You will arrive at a bus stop on Einsteinova, standing at the front of the marked off lane will give drivers a place to pull over. The road splits shortly after, but both ways lead towards Vienna, so to catch all possible rides it\\'s best to wait before the fork. It\\'s not ideal as three lanes of traffic are moving quickly by. If you are unsuccessful, two bus companies operating between Bratislava and Vienna pick up right at that bus stop about every 15 minutes during the day. Also, there\\'s an on-ramp from the bridge onto Einsteinova, where cars have space to pull over, \\n\\n====Hungarian Border====\\n\\nInvolves slightly less walking than the Vysehradska gas station. Take bus no. 91 from the SNP Bridge(Most SNP) stop ([http://imhd.sk/ba/schedule-timetable/route-line/90 schedule]) or bus no. 90 from the Nové SND stop (near Eurovea, but this one is right in front of the National Theater - [http://imhd.sk/ba/schedule-timetable/route-line/91 schedule]) to Čunovské jazerá - this is a \"request stop\", so you\\'ll need to push a button to let the driver know you\\'re getting out. From Čunovské jazerá walk further down along the road, where to your right, across the field, you can already see the highway. After about one kilometer, you will reach a farm track leading to the right, across the railway tracks towards a bridge over the highway, where you can already spot the former border infrastructure. Depending on the season, you might have to fight your way through a corn field, though, but that\\'s our deal, right?\\n\\nSigns will be useful here and, unlike in Vysehradska, all traffic will be headed to Hungary (duh!) - getting a ride to Budapest will be a piece of cake. You can also approach people on either side of the border as they\\'re getting the Hungarian vignette (highway toll) - the shops are located in the old customs buildings.\\n\\n\\'\\'My experience was that not many people stop to get the vignette here, only truck drivers and they are skeptical of hitchhikers. Surprisingly, many of them don\\'t go to Budapest at all and I got offered a couple of weird rides, like Croatia. I found a ride to Budapest after an hour. - Rebew (28.07.2021)\\'\\'\\n\\n====Aupark gas station====\\n\\nProbably the easily reachable way to go Vienna: Take the bus number 50 and get off the last station which is named Aupark. There is OMV gas station, McD and big shopping mall as well. Since this location is not that far from the center of Bratislava there are some local people who go to further into Slovakia or city center. But there is a good possibility to find a ride for Vienna. In my case ıt took 5 min from OMW to find a lift and ıt was at around 18h, December 2013. For local people you can ask like that \" Idete do Viedne?\" You can also try to get a lift to the first gas station on the motorway named Jarovce.\\n\\n====Tesco Lamac gas station====\\n\\nMotorway-gas station in the north-east of the city. Take Bus 63 (crosses the whole town) and get out at Tesco Lamac (next to a shopping centre). Walk 1 km northwards and you get to a bridge that crosses the motorway. Go down the steps at the bridge and another 100m north and you\\'re there. Or you can get there also by bus 83, 34, 22 and 20 or even 30. When taking the buses 83, 34, 22 and 20 you have to get off at the bus stop \\'\\'\\'\\'\\'Húščavova\\'\\'\\'\\'\\', walk back few meter to the bridge, go under it, and walk 50m to the gas station. When taking the bus 30. Get off at \\'\\'\\'\\'\\'Pridánky\\'\\'\\'\\'\\', cross the bridge over the highway, go under it, and walk 50m to the gas station. Both bus stops require you to give the driver a signal it\\'s a button in the bus (When there\\'s only one button that is it. When there are two buttons it\\'s not the one that opens the door, it\\'s the one that says STOP.) Most of the cars will be locals but there are also some trucks passing by here. If nobody is going far ask people also if they aren\\'t going along the D2 to Jarovce and passing by the big gas station located there ([[Bratislava#Vy.C5.A1ehradsk.C3.A1_gas_station|Vyšehradská]]). [http://goo.gl/maps/ij3D Here is the map]\\n\\n== Public Transport ==\\n\\nBratislava has pretty cheap and fast (except rush hours) network of trams, buses and trolleybuses. In Slovakia, city public transport is referred to as \\'\\'MHD\\'\\'. Tickets in Bratislava are sold by travel time, \\'\\'\\'not by\\'\\'\\' the number of rides or directions or zones (within Bratislava proper). Thus, all tickets are transfer tickets. They cost EUR 0.70 for 15 minutes, EUR 0.90 for 30 minutes and EUR 1.20 for 60 minutes. Students can buy tickets at half-price, \\'\\'\\'but only\\'\\'\\' if they\\'re an EU citizen and have an ISIC card from an EU school. Drivers don\\'t sell tickets. Beware that you must mark your ticket instantly after entering vehicle. To plan your journey you can use [http://imhd.zoznam.sk/ba/maps.html maps of lines], [http://imhd.zoznam.sk/ba/journey-planner.html online route planner] or [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.circlegate.tt.transit.android offline Android route planner] (1 month trial). You may use an app ([https://apps.apple.com/sk/app/ids-bk-cestovn%C3%A9-l%C3%ADstky/id1360894243?l=sk AppStore] and [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.casperise.urbi.online.bid Google Play]) to purchase tickets using a smartphone - beware that the tickets become valid 30 seconds after purchase.\\n\\nBlackriding is not advised, ticket inspectors don\\'t wear any uniforms and the penalty is very high compared to ticket price (EUR 50 if paid within 5 business days, EUR 70 afterwards). They always come in three, two of them are ticket inspectors and one is security guard. However, if you\\'re from outside the EU(within the EU, there are ways to get you to pay), say you don\\'t want to pay and give them your passport, if they ask for it because the most that they can do is to write you a fine. They will try to intimidate you and make up all kinds of bullshit, but again, all they can do is take down your personal details.\\n\\n\\n== Sleeping ==\\n\\nIt\\'s not possible to sleep at the railway station, you will be asked to leave, valid ticket won\\'t help you. Better option is to sleep in sleeping bag or set up a tent in one of many forest areas, it\\'s absolutely normal to wild camp in Slovakia, you won\\'t have any problems. One of the best options are \\'\\'Koliba\\'\\', just use trolleybus 203, get out at final stop and walk on the top of hill. You should find nice place to sleep. You can also try \\'\\'Pečniansky les\\'\\' on the right side of Danube river. It\\'s also possible to sleep around \\'\\'Draždiak\\'\\' lakes in Petržalka or in forests near \\'\\'Železná studienka\\'\\'. If you are willing to spend more time in public transport, you can take a ride to \\'\\'Čuňovo\\'\\' and sleep close to local lake.\\n\\n\\n== Other useful info ==\\n\\nThere is no problem in finding free or unsecured Wi-Fi. City offers free hotspots at Main Square, along Danube and in many other places. There\\'s also possibility to connect in many of McDonald\\'s, railway station, or [http://www.kcdunaj.sk/ KC Dunaj] also has very good connection.\\n\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|Slovakia}}\\n[[:wikivoyage:Bratislava]]\\n\\n\\n[[Category:Slovakia]]\\n[[Category:E65]]\\n[[Category:E75]]\\n[[Category:E58]]\\n[[fr: Bratislava]]',\n",

This may change the traffic situation in southern Braunschweig a little bit in a positive way, there could be very good new hitchhiking spots towards east, south and west in the southern city. Just check it out!\\n\\nThe gas stations Rüningen Nord and Süd have been closed and new gas stations a bit further away from the city have been opened, Salzhitter Hüttenblick (as of Aug. 2018). \\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\nDont\\'t try to [[hitchhiking|hitchhike]] near the IKEA on Hansestraße or on Hamburgerstraße. Cars can\\'t stop there.\\n=== East ([[Magdeburg]], [[Berlin]]) or West ([[Hannover]], [[Dortmund]], [[Amsterdam]]) {{Autobahn|2}} ===\\nFrom the city center take the Bus 560 from Braunschweig Rathaus to Wipshausen and exit in Zweidorf - Peiner Straße. From there walk the Rothbergstraße until you see the service station, place yourself there if you want to go east. Use the tunnel of the Rothbergstraße to cross the motorway and place yourself on this side of the service station if you want to go west. If the main gate of the service station is locked, you will have to either climb the fence or walk on the bridge and walk on the motorway till the station.\\n\\n\\'\\'Comment: I lived around Braunschweig for 5 years and I never used the spot above. I think the Bus ride is to long and also I wouldn\\'t climb the fence and definitely would not recommend to walk the A2 because it is one of Germany\\'s major motorways and a little dangerous and absolutely forbidden. Also it is not difficult to get rides at the following alternatives.\\'\\'\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Alternatives:\\'\\'\\'\\n* The ramp \\'\\'Braunschweig Ost\\'\\': From the city center take the tram to Volkmarode. Then take the 6km walk to the ramp (or try to hitchhike to there). It is an average position (average 40 min), but my standard if go to Berlin because i often get direct rides from there. \\n* Take the Bus to Groß Schwülper and exit near the ramp \\'\\'Braunschweig Hafen\\'\\' or take the walk from Hansestraße (3km) if you get stuck there. It is a good spot to go to the west (Hannover), east seems to be difficult. The spot is used by many vehicles from the industrial area Braunschweig Hafen, thats also why there is almost no traffic on sunday! Only good to hitch on working days!\\n\\n=== South ([[Göttingen]], [[Kassel]], [[Frankfurt]]) {{Autobahn|7}} ===\\nTake Tram 1 to Braunschweig-Hansestrasse Ost or bus 484 to Braunschweig-Hansestrasse Ost or Daimlerstrasse. On the opposite side of the street from the McDonalds, you can wait on the corner with a sign for SZ (Salzgitter) which will bring you to the newly opened (Sept 2018) gas station \"Salzgitter Hüttenblick). A lot of people drive from Braunschweig to at least Salzgitter. The spot is great because there is a traffic light for cars waiting to turn, and you can walk up and down the line of cars with your sign. Be ready to get into a car quickly, though, in case the light changes. I\\'ve never waited more than 5 minutes here.\\n\\nAt Salzgitter Hüttenblick, you\\'ll find people going south on the A7, towards Kassel, but also going to Hannover.\\n\\n=== North (Gifhorn, Soltau) {{Bde|4}} ===\\nThe Umgehungsstraße A391 goes along the west side of the city directly to the B4 that brings you to the north. You can use the Ramp on the Theodor-Heuss-Straße. You can wait for a lift between Clean Car and Harry\\'s Fliesenmarkt. The cars that go to the North are not so fast there and the sidewalk and the street have the same level. You might also try to find a lift at the two gas stations Clean Car and Shell.\\n\\n=== to [[Wolfenbüttel]] ===\\nTry your luck in the city center, for example at the \\'\\'John F. Kennedy Platz\\'\\' or from the railstation. You can also wait on the Wolfenbütteler Straße between Denn\\'s (Supermarket for ecological food) and the park. The street brings you directly on the motorway to Wolfenbüttel {{Ade|36}}.\\n\\n=== to [[Wolfsburg]] ===\\nTake the tram to Volkmarode and then try to hitchhike the B248, which leads to Wolfsburg.\\n\\n== Hitching In ==\\n\\n=== from A2 ===\\nDon\\'t let yourself be dropped at \\'\\'Braunschweig Flughafen\\'\\' (Airport). It is a research airport and there is no traffic on weekends or after 6pm. From \\'\\'Braunschweig Ost\\'\\' it is a 6km walk to the next tram station (but maybe hitchable). \\n\\'Braunschweig Nord\\'\\' is a good place to be dropped off when you\\'re coming from the A2, especially coming from the east. Exit 55 BS Kreuz Nord, make sure you slow down to not end up driving back onto the Autobahn (not very clearly marked). Then exit \"Hansestrasse\" and there you can drive into the McDonalds parking lot (make sure you\\'re on the left-turn lane to be able to drive straight into the parking lot). This is a 2 km exit so just make sure you ask your driver. For him/her, it\\'s easy from there to get back onto the highway. It\\'s 3 km down Hansestr going west, so for someone driving towards Berlin it\\'s a detour but someone driving west, it\\'s in their direction anyway.\\nFrom there,  you can take Tram 1 from Braunschweig-Hansestrasse Ost or bus 484 from Braunschweig-Hansestrasse Ost or Daimlerstrasse. \\n\\nIf you\\'re coming from the 391, you can also be dropped off at BS Kreuz Nord.\\n\\nBest is \\'\\'Braunschweig Hafen\\'\\' but it is still a walk 3km to the next tram-station. If coming from the west, it is possible that your driver leaves at BS Hafen and then takes you to Hansestraße (where you will find the tram station) your driver can easily go back on the motorway from there because there is another ramp. \\n\\n=== {{Ade|391}} ===\\nYou can use all the ramps \\'\\'Weststadt\\'\\', \\'\\'Lehndorf\\'\\' or \\'\\'Hansestraße\\'\\', you will be able to find a bus from there.\\n\\n=== {{Ade|39}} ===\\nSince the construction of motorway A39 is finished, drivers prefer to take this road instead of A391. \\n\\nFrom \\'\\'Braunschweig Südstadt\\'\\' (Exit 12) it\\'s 1.5 km to Braunschweig Central Station. The bus needs five minutes. Your driver can turn at the petrol station to go back to the motorway.\\n\\nIt looks like it\\'s possible to get dropped off at \\'\\'Kreuz Braunschweig Süd\\'\\' if your driver turns south towards Braunschweig Heidberg, then stops at the petrol station to let you get out and then turns right to a roundabout to turn. You have to walk further south to get to the tram station \\'\\'HEH-Kliniken\\'\\'.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|Lower Saxony}}\\n\\n[[Category:Lower Saxony]]\\n[[Category:Route Amsterdam - Berlin]]\\n[[Category:E30]]\\n\\n[[de:Braunschweig]]',\n",

The best place to stand is at the exit to the long-stay car parks, making sure you can see the number plates of cars where they pause to exit. (Cars with yellow and black plates are likely to be heading to the Netherlands, and German cars tell you where they are from by the first two or three letters on them.)\\n\\nFurthermore try to place yourself at \"Neuenlander Straße\" out- or inbound. Outbound you will get to the motorway (as describes above), inbound you can easily get into town. To Neulander Strasse one can easily get by tram 6 (Flughafen) or 6E (~ 5 stops from the center). \\n\\nYou can also try on the entrance of the highway near IKEA. Very nice spot general direction south. It\\'s a bit more difficult for straight direction west if you want to enter the Netherlands from the far north to Groningen. Reasons: IKEA is just behind the spot and hence there are many people from all over the place to buy some furniture. This can also cause problems, when they are totally loaded.\\nHow to get there : Take either tram line no. 4 or 5 to station \\'Huckelriede\\' then switch over into bus line no. 53 until the end (IKEA) or station \\'Carl-Zeiss-Str.\\' (one earlier).

You can take the bus in Bremen from the Hauptbahnof until Wildseshausen Bahnhof. It take something like one hour fifteen to get there, and it cost EUR 3. From Wildeshausen train station you have to walk north for 20 minutes, pass the bridge over the Autobahn, then take left, and you will find the petrol station.\\n\\n===North===\\n\\nA good option for heading north beyond Hamburg is the [[Raststätte|Raststätte Wildeshausen]] to the south of Bremen. Although this seems out of the way in the wrong direction, it is a great spot for rides up the A1, and the train to Wildeshausen (RB58 Direction Osnabrück) runs at least some of the time without ticket inspectors.

Just after the traffic lights there is a pub, \"The Airport Tavern\", a total of 10 min walk from the airport building. Cars tend to go slow as the pub is right after the traffic lights, and in front of the pub there is enough space for them to stop. About 40 yards away towards Bristol there is a bus stop with even more space. Waiting times of less than 30min were experienced an early sunday morning, but during busier times it might be less.  \\n\\n=== Along A38 ===\\n\\nIf you are in the South Bristol Cemetery area, next to the Langford Road Bus station there is  a recess in the road used as parking spot with plenty of space for cars to stop. This is not a busy spot, but waiting times of less than 30 minutes are nonetheless been experienced. \\n\\n== Hitchhiking Out ==\\n\\n=== To [[London]], [[Birmingham]] & [[Cardiff]] ===\\n\\nThere are two spots to leave Bristol from the center, the \\'\\'M32 Silvey Services\\'\\' {{Coords|51.460854|-2.58154|1}} opposite Staples. This is a Shell petrol station, which is an excellent hitching spot. Signing from just next to the exit, cars are able to pull in or pick you up as they leave the petrol station and whilst not all lanes can pick you up, you are highly visible and all cars will pass you. Normally less than 15 minute wait, though Jonathan has waited up to 90 minutes. Many cars will not be going to London but don\\'t be stressed.\\n\\nAbout one kilometer further [https://maps.hitchwiki.org/?lat=51.4665740992362&lng=-2.57449150085449&zoom=14&trip=0 after the roundabout] there is a long hard shoulder next with enough space for cars to stop. \\n\\n\\nWhere the [https://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.505035,-2.527571&num=1&t=h&sll=51.483521,-2.532177&sspn=0.067561,0.154324&ie=UTF8&ll=51.483521,-2.532177&spn=0.067561,0.154324&z=13 Avon ring road (A4174) meets the M32] you can try to get a lift standing by the traffic lights next to the roundabout which is right before the slip road. (Which is better than [[M32 (GB)|M32]] in center; but 7 km north of center.)\\n\\n=== Going north towards [[Birmingham]]/{{Mgb|5}} ===\\n\\nThere is a bus (number 309 or 310) that goes from the bus station to a village called Almondsbury which is really close to the {{Mgb|5}} and also far away from the Bristol suburbs. This is for those annoyed by hitching around suburb traffic.

The road network consists of only 177km. 100 times more beautiful, friendly and hitchable than the US Virgin Islands, although unfortunately culture has picked up one bad North American habit - expected tipping.\\n\\nVirgin Gorda island is one of the most beautiful places to hitch hike standing in the back of a utility, on lovely windy hilly roads, looking out and seeing the sea creeping into all the sounds/coves in every direction. The locals are wonderful and will most likely go out of their way to take you where you want to go if you are polite and thankful (as you should be generally).\\n\\nNothing is easier than hitching in the BVI---the local people there are uncommonly friendly and hitching is a regular means of transportation. Obviously on the more remote, under-populated islands, \\'\\'finding\\'\\' traffic is the challenge. But otherwise, it is very safe. Safer than walking along the road, I would say. The British Virgin Islands are mountainous and steep, and it is said that most of the roads were originally goat paths that were simply paved over and therefore can be very steep, winding, and at times, terrifying. Be advised that there really isn\\'t any speed limit and the locals are not shy about whipping around hairpin turns overlooking sharp cliffs.\\n\\nThe final paragraph below placed here previously is not only incorrect and obviously not researched but is also the perfect example of the type of scare information on hitchwiki that you should take with a grain (or more) of salt. The drink driving limit has been 0.08% (same as the U.K.) since the early 1990\\'s and the crime rate is much lower than that of almost all european countries:\\n\\n\"We were also told by one guy who picked us up that there are no laws against drinking and driving. So you may want to have some discretion about whose car you jump in---we\\'ve found that at night even some of our cab drivers were visibly wasted. Ah, the island life. Obviously, single women should always take more precautions and I would only recommend single women travelers to hitch during the day. While the majority of the locals are extremely friendly and helpful, there still were incidents of violent crimes and crimes against tourists. And as a young female traveler myself, I noticed that some of the younger men loved themselves a tourist girl and could be quite aggressive. Other than that fair warning, hitch on.\"\\n\\n{{Caribbean Islands}}\\n{{UK constituent countries}}\\n[[Category:Island]]\\n[[Category:Caribbean]]',\n",

This road then leads under the large street \\'\\'Vídeňská\\'\\', where there is a tram stop. The driver can drive on to a roundabout and easily get back onto the D1.\\n\\nAt the Bratislava exit there is a shopping centre Avion with a free bus to the city centre. The driver can easily get back onto the D1 too by driving about 2 km.\\n\\nIf driver is going toward Vienna or Bratislava it\\'s quite clear where to get off.\\n\\n\\n=== From [[Vienna]] {{Dcz|52}}{{E|461}} ===\\n\\nIf your driver is not going into Brno, ask him/her to drop you off at the \"Futurum\" shopping centre on the motorway. There you will find a free bus to central Brno.\\n\\n\\n=== From [[Bratislava]] {{Dcz|2}}{{E|65}} ===\\n\\nIf your driver is not going into Brno, you can jump off either at the \"Olympia\" or \"Avion\" shopping centre on the motorway. From both you will find a free bus to central Brno.\\n\\n\\n\\n=== From [[Olomouc]], [[Kromeriz|Kroměříž]] {{Dcz|1}} ===\\n\\nIf the driver continues to Prague jump off at OMV petrol station at the end of Brno (Starý Lískovec). There \\'\\'\\'don\\'t\\'\\'\\' go though the appletree plantation - it is too complicated. Easier way is more hidden - go back next to the highway for about 300 m and then there is a path going under the motorway. Go left and you\\'ll get to the town (and public transport) in 5 minutes.\\n\\nIf the driver continues to Bratislava jump off at IKEA.\\n\\nIf the driver continues to Vienna jump of at Futurum Shopping centre or at a petrol station in Modřice. At both places there is a tram route.\\n\\n\\n== Hitching out ==\\n\\n\\n=== Northwest towards [[Jihlava]], [[Praha]] {{Dcz|1}}{{E|50}}{{E|65}} ===\\n\\n==== First option ====\\n\\nThis spot is quickly and easily accessible from various parts of Brno with hitchability from average to good. Find trolley-bus 25, 26 or 29 and get off at stop \"Čtvrtě\". From the bridge you can see big road to Prague. Go down and after 200 m there is smaller petrol station. Next to it is great place to hitchhike just a few metres from pump machines where you can ask people. Unfortunately on this lane often parks some truck or two so you can only hitchhike cars leaving station or ask.\\n\\nIf you get stuck here, you can try your luck in another spot which is quite close to this one. Walk towards the highway and the bridge over your road, climb up the bridge and follow the road NW until you see traffic lights and you can stand right after the lights where you get people from both directions. However, it\\'s really difficult for drivers to stop here for you to get in. It\\'s much, much better to just go to second option, it\\'s not that far away.\\n\\n==== Second option ====\\n\\n15 minutes walk from stop \"Osová\" - trams 6, 8 or trolley-buses 25, 29 (terminus). From tram stop go up to the bridge. From trolley-buses loop go over the bridge. There is bus stop, you can take bus 69 to stop \"Čermákova\" or continue this wide road 400 m to the end - crossroad with new houses behind. You can already see the motorway and petrol station. But turn right. After 350 m you are at the bus stop \"Čermákova\". Turn left (street Čermákova) and at the end you can see small tunnel under motorway. Just before tunnel on the left you can go up and after 300 m you are at OMV petrol station. In winter could be hard to get there.\\n\\nThis station is bigger than the one at first option, little bit harder to access, good hitchability.\\n\\n==== Third option ===\\nSmall petrol station OMV on the motorway near Bosonohy - almost without cars. To Bosonohy, bus stop \"Hoštická\" you can get by bus 69 (from Masaryk\\'s University campus, or trams 6, 8 stop \"Dunajská\"). Then go little bit back to the main road and right. After 1,5 km you will see that station. Or from \"Dunajská\" you can go by bus 401 or 402 (you have to pay the driver; once an hour) to request stop \"Tranzitní plynovod\". Just few metres back and right is that petrol station.\\n\\nNonsense to go here from Brno city. It was pure luck to get lift in 5 minutes. Getting there takes more time than average waiting time in 1st or 2nd spot.\\n\\n==== Fourth option ====\\n\\nBigger petrol station Shell on the motorway near Popůvky. A bit further from Brno (3 km after the Third option) but almost all cars go to Prague or even further. Take bus 401 or 402 (↑↑) to the \"Popůvky - Vintrovna\"  stop. Continue on the main road 850 m and there is the spot. You can also walk & hitchhike to this place from Bosnohy.\\n\\n\\n=== South towards [[Bratislava]] (SK), [[Budapest]] (H) {{Dcz|2}}{{E|65}} ===\\n\\n==== First option ====\\n\\nTake bus number 67, or the free \"Avion bus\" (it goes from 9am till 10pm every 20/30 minute) that starts on the bus stop \"Úzká\", and get off at the commercial zone “Avion”. There is a petrol station (where you can shower and even sleep) along the motorway which is going to [[Slovakia]]. It\\'s a big commercial zone with big shops. One of them has free internet access, it\\'s the electrical shop before Ikea. This isn\\'t the greatest spot, but there just isn\\'t any better, so don\\'t expect any miracles. Asking around is probably crucial at this spot. Ideally get a trucker to take you at least to the next MOL gas station (about 16km out).\\n\\n\\'\\'I got stuck at this spot for almost eight hours, from early morning until about 3pm. There is surprisingly little traffic and a sign is worthless, you have to ask around or sit at the gas station. Speaking Russian or Czech will probably go a very long way as the mistrust is the biggest issue here. The second option is just as bad. - Rebew (27.07.2021)\\'\\'\\n\\n==== Second Option ====\\nThis is probably a much better one than the first option. Take bus 40, 48, 59, 67 or the free \"Avion bus\" and get off at Hněvkovského. Walk 450m in the direction the bus was going (if you took the bus from the city center). After passing a crossroads with traffic lights, you will see a gas station. Now you can choose whether you approach people that stop at the gas station or stand at the beginning of the fairly long driveway to it.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Vienna]] (A) {{Dcz|52}}{{E|461}} ===\\n\\n==== First option ====\\nTake the free bus from behind Tesco, at the tram 2 stop \\'\\'Ořechovská\\'\\', to the shopping center (\\'\\'obchodni centrum\\'\\') Futurum. Once you are at at the shopping center Futurum, you will find a Tesco gas station, but most of the people there are just staying in town. From here you can walk couple of kilometres or use tram 2 to second spot. Catch ride to a Shell gas station in Mikulov, from where its really easy to find a ride to Vienna.\\n\\n==== Unicorn fuel station ====\\n\\nTake a tram 2 to the stop \"Modřice, Tyršova\". And walk little bit back near the Unicorn fuel station. Cars are going very fast here, however, and don\\'t have much room to stop, so you might try alternating between thumbing on the road and asking drivers who stop at the station.\\n\\n==== Third option ====\\n\\nThere is a nice spot for hitchhiking just next to the tram 2 stop \"Ústřední hřbitov\" where you can hitch south to Vienna or just to the next petrol station. When you get off the tram just go on the main street and then turn right 100m and you will find a nice place to stop cars. Keep in mind that this spot is not on the main road so there\\'s a litle smaller trafic.\\n\\n==== Fourth option ====\\n\\nMikulov is a nice town near the Austrian border with very slow and dense long-distance traffic. Take the bus 105 from the centre, Ústřední hřbitov or Novomoravanská stops all the way to Mikulov. The ticket is 14 CZK with ISIC, or 56 CZK (~2 €), you can buy it directly from the driver. Looking for a car going to Mikulov at the petrol stations in Brno is not as easy since many people only go to the nearby villages. It takes some time but from Mikulov you can get easy rides by standing on the roadside or asking around far beyond Vienna. \\n\\n\\n=== Northeast towards [[Prostějov]], [[Olomouc]], [[Ostrava]], [[Katowice]] (PL) {{Dcz|1}}{{E|462}} east towards [[Kroměříž]], [[Zlín]] {{Motorway Number Czech Republic|1}} east towards [[Uherské Hradiště]], [[Trenčín]] (SK) {{Ncz|50}}{{E|50}} ===\\n\\n==== First option ====\\n\\nTake tram number 8 to station \"Krásného\", from the station go to the overbridge. To Olomouc you will stay over head 30 minutes.\\n\\n==== Second option ====\\n\\nTake the trolleybus number 33 from the railway station (Hlavní nádraží) to the station \"Langrova\" (it takes 13 minutes). Cross the street and go up the street Slavkovská, after two minutes you come to a main road which you also cross and continue on a footpath straight for another 50 meters to a petrol station which already lies on a highway.\\n\\n==== Third option ====\\n\\nBest spot (for D1 only): From the stop Úzká (next to the big Tesco close to train station) or bus station \"Zvonařka\" take bus 602 or 702 to \"Jiříkovice, motorest Rohlenka\" (about 20min). Cross the street and you are at a huge petrol station (with KFC, McD, etc.) which is outside of Brno right at D1. Lot of drivers to Olomouc and Ostrava.\\n\\nAlternatively if you don\\'t want to take a bus to Rohlenka, you can get there by one more car hichthiking as well. Take a bus 33 from Hlavní nádraží (train station) and go to stop \"Slatina sídliště\" (terminal). Go right and you will see a roundabout 50 m ahead. If you cross it straight and hitchhike there, you\\'ll get to Rohlenka in 15 minutes without paying the bus. (good choice if you have already ticket for Brno public transport)\\n\\n==== Fourth option ====\\n\\nGood for Uherské Hradiště. Take a bus 33 from Hlavní nádraží (train station) and go to stop \"Slatina sídliště\" (terminal). Go right and you will see a roundabout 50 m ahead. Cross it straight and hitchhike there. Usually you get first car to Slavkov u Brna and then second car to Uherské Hradiště or further.\\n\\n\\n=== North towards [[Pardubice]], [[Hradec Králové]] {{Dcz|43}}{{E|461}} ===\\n\\n==== First option ====\\n\\nTake tram 12 to the stop \"Červinkova\" and go 200 m to the left. Just before the bridge get down to the highway. Almost everywhere there is good shoulder for cars to stop or another 200 m behind is Shell petrol station.\\n\\n==== Second option ====\\n\\nBy buses 41 and 42 get to the shopping centre Globus (bus stop \"Ivanovice, Globus\"). There you can hitchhike just after roundabout or up at the main road.\\n\\n==== Other options ====\\nAt the highway near tram 6 terminal station \"Kr. Pole, nádraží\".<br />\\nAt the highway connection near tram 1 stop \"Tylova\".<br />\\nBoth spots are probably better than Second option spot.

Make a sign that says: 'Gent', 'Torhout' or 'Jabbeke'.\\n\\n=== Towards [[The Netherlands]], [[Amsterdam]] ===\\n\\nAbout 30 minute walk from the main city center you will find a road called Maalse Steenweg. This road (N9) will lead towards Ghent, Antwerp (E34) and the Netherlands (E19, A12 etc). You can hitchhike from anywhere in this road (it is a rather small local road but a lot of people take this road to exit the city), but there is a busy intersection and bus stop in front of a McDonalds (Maalse Steenweg 225) where you can easily catch a ride on to E34.\\n\\n=== Towards Oostkamp, [[Gent|Ghent]], [[Brussels]] ===\\nWhen getting out of the main entrance of the train station, walk straight and follow the main road to the right. Walk straight for about 1,5 km. You'll pass some bus parkings, some small channels and a huge bridge. Just behind this bridge, at the traffic light, walk to the right again. There you'll find three petrol stations. You can just hitch next to the road at the first or second station, passing traffic can easily stop here. Most rides go to Oostkamp, ask your driver to drop you out close to the on-ramp of the highway. There, you can continue hitchhiking east- or westwards.\\n\\n=== E403 to [[Lille]], [[Paris]] ===\\nWalk the N397 right down to the Roundabout to the E403 after the Kineopolis Bridge there is a parking line for trucks. Position yourself close to the ramp to the roundabout. Took me 30 minutes to find a ride.\\n\\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\\n\\n[[nomad:Beuges]] [[trash:Bruges]]\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|West-Vlaanderen}}\\n\\n\\n[[Category:West-Vlaanderen]]\\n[[Category:E40]]\",\n",

Brussels is a very international city. \\n\\n== Hitching in ==\\n=== East ===\\nIf you do not encounter a driver that goes inside the city, but instead takes the northern ring road around the city, you can ask them to pull off the motorway (E19) at junction 7a/7b \\'\\'(Chaussee Romaine/Parc des Expositions/Tentoonstellingspark)\\'\\' (basically, the Atomium and Heysel Stadium area) or at junction 8 \\'\\'(Wemmel)\\'\\'{{Coords|50.90259052095862|4.326904907594108|1}}. At both exits, drivers can immediately rejoin the motorway from the slip road opposite the exit. From the exits, you simply have to walk towards the Expo park to take tram 23, 81, or 94; or Metro 6 from stations \\'\\'Koning Boudewijn\\'\\' or \\'\\'Heysel\\'\\'.\\n\\nAlternatively, you might also ask to be left at the service station on the E40 in Leuven, before the ring road around Brussels, with the idea of catching a local ride that would get you into town. This might be necessary if your driver goes up along the E19 to Antwerp, as there won\\'t be any places for him to drop you off.\\n\\n=== Northwest ===\\nIf you arrive from the northwest (Gent), you can ask to be dropped at the Services in Groot-Bijgaarden which is 2.5km before the ring of Brussels along the E40 from where you can walk to Zellik and catch bus 213 or 214 to the centre, or try to hitch a ride into town.\\n\\nIf your ride only takes the western ring road (E19), (from Gent or the south), you can ask to be dropped off at Junction 16 on the E19, from where it is walking distance to the metro 1b stations \\'\\'Eddy Merckx\\'\\' or \\'\\'Ceria\\'\\'.\\n\\n=== South ===\\nIf you coming in from the south and the driver is heading to the east of Brussels, ask to be dropped off at Delta.\\n\\nIf the driver is heading to the west of Brussels, ask to be dropped off at E19 junction at Drogenbos. It comes right after Ruisbroek service station (Total). Walk five minutes and you’ll be at the beginning of tram line 4 going to the centre.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== North-West towards [[Gent]], [[Brugge]], [[England]], ([[Lille]]) {{E|40}} ===\\n==== Option 1: Petrol stations at Baselix Shopping Centre ====\\n{{Coords|50.8712|4.2943}}<br>\\nTake train S10 from \\'\\'Brussels Noord\\'\\' station to \\'\\'Berchem Ste-Agathe\\'\\' station. Head south towards the Carrefour hypermarket and go through it\\'s car park toward the Baselix Shopping Centre and the main road Keizer Karellaan. Here you will find two petrol stations (Shell and Lukoil).  Stay there as people fill up with petrol for going to e.g. Gent]or Bruges. Just ask people. 1O minutes walk\\n\\nAlternative way : take bus 213 or 214 from bus-stop \\'\\'Brussel Rogier\\'\\' and get off at \\'\\'Sint-Agatha-Berchem Marg.v.Oostenrijk\\'\\', and then walk 300m west until you reach the petrol stations. Or walk 5 km from Rogier metro heading west on the main road R20.\\n\\n==== Option 2: Start of E40 ====\\nTake tram 82 from the Gare du Midi in direction of \\'\\'Berchem\\'\\' until the stop \\'\\'Berchem Shopping\\'\\'. From there turn left and walk up the Av. Charles Quint for about 200 meters and you are at the beginning of the E40 in the direction of Gent. Just hitch after the traffic lights, where there is space for a car to pull over behind you. The circulation is dense but cars can easily pull over and get back on the road quite safely. You can also reach this spot by the following the directions in Option 1 and then continue walking 400m west along the main road R20. \\n\\n==== Option 3: Motorway service station Groot Bijgaarden ====\\n{{Coords|50.8813|4.2539}}<br>\\nThe cheapest way: from bus-stop \\'\\'Brussel Rogier\\'\\', take De Lijn bus 213 or 214 (direction Aalst) and get off at bus-stop \\'\\'Zellik Drie Koningen\\'\\'. Cross over the street and walk back 50m in the direction from where the bus came to the roundabout. Turn into the first street to the right (Kerklaan) and walk 200m. Turn left into Theodoor Coppensstraat and walk ≈650m till you come to the junction with Louis De Bondstraat. Take a left here (south) and walk 400m until you reach a road on the right (Dilbeek Noord). Walk ≈300m and you will reach the service station.\\n\\nThis spot works extremely well, but it takes some times to get there and it\\'s also quite expensive: 2,40€ to get to Gare du Nord (blackriding the tram is easy but metro is hard) plus 3€ for the De Lijn bus (you enter the bus right at the front so you cannot blackride).\\n\\nMany people also take this route to go to Lille and Paris, and there\\'s probably more traffic on this road than on the option going towards Charleroi and Mons.\\n\\n=== South-West towards [[Charleroi]], [[Mons (Bergen)|Mons]], [[Lille]], [[Paris]] {{E|19}} ===\\n==== Option 1: E19 Motorway junction Drogenbos ====\\n{{Coords|50.7923|4.3030}}<br>\\nAt the Drogenbos motorway junction, there is a  traffic light under the motorway bridge. As cars need to wait to turn left to get on the highway, its possible to ask drivers to take you south. The next gas station \\'\\'Ruisbroek\\'\\'{{Coords|50.77763394027698|4.299328123974783|1}} is only 1,5km away\\n\\nTake bus 50 (direction Lot) to Gilson leaving from Brussels Gare du Midi/Zuidstation. This takes about 20 minutes. Walk southeast along Paul Gilsonlaan, then follow the road round onto Grote Baan to the junction with Verlengde Stallestraat. Turn right (west) and walk ≈250m to the traffic light under the motorway. Altogether the walk is ≈500m and takes five minutes.\\n\\nOr take tram 4 ([http://m.stib.be/line.php?lang=fr&line=4&iti=1 STIB]) till the terminus ([http://maps.google.be/maps?q=stalle+prolongee&hl=nl&ll=50.795375,4.318566&spn=0.000895,0.001725&sll=50.792373,4.316597&sspn=0.045358,0.110378&t=h&hnear=Verlengde+Stallestraat,+Vlaams-Brabant&z=19 Stalle]), then walk further towards the motorway along Rue Prolongée de Stalle/Verlengde Stallestraat (with some massive shops) till you reach the traffic lights underneath the motorway bridge. \\n\\nYou can also leave tram 4 at the stop Egide van Ophem (2 stops before terminus). Here you just need to cross the street and you\\'ll find yourself on a DATS 24 petrol station. Depending on the time of the day (best is around evening rush hour, as people are leaving Brussels), it can be easy or very easy to get a ride to the Ruisbroek service station. Make sure to state very clearly where you want to go (Ruisbroek petrol station is on the “ring”) as many people go through it without knowing, for example if their destination is Waterloo.\\n\\n==== Option 2: Ruisbroek Petrol Station ====\\n{{Coords|50.7776|4.2993}}\\n\\nTo get directly on the Ruisbroek Petrol Station (which is located on the western part of the ring), you need to take bus 50 (direction Lot station) from Brussels Midi Station to Ruisbroek Voetbalplein. This takes about half an hour. From here you walk straight and turn the second to the left (into Hemelstraat) and follow this till the end. Go left into Broekweg and follow your way onto the petrol station.\\n\\nAnother option is taking the local train from one of Brussels\\' railway stations (e.g. Centrale or Midi) to Ruisbroeck for 2,40€ (ticket at the machine). From there you can also walk (allow 30 min).\\n\\nEIther way, you biggest obstacle ist the ditch around the rest station which you have to traverse. It usually filled with water and can be a slippery thing. However, there is/was a tree trunk placed in the ditch which you can use to get to the other side. It\\'s close to the petrol station. If you cross here you will also find a hole in the fence where you can pass through.\\n\\n\\n==== Option 3: Internationalelaan/Boulevard International ====\\n{{Coords|50.8159|4.3041}}\\n\\nInternationalelaan/Boulevard International close to the motorway entrance. There is a lot of traffic and much space for cars to stop, even a petrol station where you could ask people directly. To get there, take bus 78 from the Brussels Zuidstation/Gare du Midi in direction of Humanité and get out at the stop Bollinckx. Attention! The bus only runs every hour. [http://www.stib.be/horaires-dienstregeling.html?l=fr Schedule] Keep in mind that you are now in the middle of an industrial zone!\\n\\n==== Option 4: E19 Motorway junction 17 (Ceria/Coovi) ====\\n{{Coords|50.8135|4.2899}}\\n\\nAnother option to take metro yellow line 5 (direction Érasme/Erasmus) and get off at CERIA/COOVI. Walk Chaussée de Mons/Bergensesteenweg down south (you can ask people the direction of Ikea). Some 150 meters from the metro station you will see a bridge. Go down across the bridge, there you will see entrance (consisting of 3 lanes from 3 different directions) to the motorway in direction of Mons/Paris. 5 km further there will be a big Total petrol station called \\'\\'Ruisbroek\\'\\'{{Coords|50.778996609025434|4.300230143955976|1}}, there you will easily find a ride further to the south.\\n\\n==== Option 5: Delta (South-East) ====\\nAlthough Delta is mostly known as the best spot to get to Louvain-la-Neuve then Namur and Luxembourg along the E411 (see below), it can very well be suited to get on the E19 (Nivelles, Charleroi or Mons, then Paris, or even Lille). Using a sign on this spot is mandatory as drivers are used to see hitchhikers going to Louvain-la-Neuve (E411 rather than E19). Unless your driver goes further, which is often the case, ask to be dropped at rest area of Nivelles 30 minutes from Brussels (the one with the Total petrol station and a restaurant that is built across the highway).\\n\\nThe spot has direct access from the exit no. 4 of metro station Delta on line 5 (15 minutes ride from the city center).\\n\\nVUB and ULB students or hitchhikers leaving from Ixelles have a reason to prefer this option as it will save them time compared to reaching Stalle stop (Drogenbos) by tram 4.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can ask drivers directly at the petrol station Lukoil (30 minutes on average). On the contrary, Texaco petrol station’s staff, on boulevard du Triomphe, has proven to be very unfriendly to hitchhikers once, threatening to call the cops.\\n\\n\\n=== Southeast towards [[Louvain-la-Neuve]], [[Namur]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Lyon]], [[Strasbourg|Strasbourg]], [[Geneve]] {{E|411}} ===\\nThe E411 to Luxembourg is a recommended direction to head further South. This option should probably also be considered to go the South if you want to avoid Paris.  Because petrol is a lot cheaper in Luxembourg you can easily find long rides at the petrol station in Luxembourg before the border.\\n\\n==== Option 1: Delta ====\\n{{Coords|50.8175|4.4051}}\\n\\nOne of the historically well-known places by local hitchhikers, \\'Delta is on the way towards Louvain-La-Neuve (student town) and is situated right at the exit no. 4 of metro station Delta (15 minutes from the centre), next to the Delta bus depot. To get there, take metro line 5 direction Herrmann-Debroux, or bus 71 to Delta. It is common to bump into one or two other (student) hitchhikers there. There\\'s a petrol station (Lukoil) next to the metro station where you won\\'t wait more than five minutes on a Sunday morning if you say you\\'re a student.\\n\\nHistorical note: as [[Louvain-la-Neuve]] is a student town, and Delta is at the entrance of the motorway and next to the VUB/ULB (Brussels university), many students used to hitchhike that route.\\n\\n==== Option 2: Station Beaulieu in Ixelles ====\\nTo get to metro station Beaulieu in Ixelles, take line 5 direction \\'\\'Herrmann-Debroux\\'\\'. You will notice many cars stopping at traffic lights just before the station. This road connects with the motorway towards the South. Some hitchhiker got a lift in less than 2 minutes. There is a big service station 10 minutes down the road if needed for further lifts.\\n\\n====Option 3: Demey====\\nTake the metro to the station Demey and find a direct entrance to the highway right next to the station. There is a pavement, so you can hitchhike safely.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Waterloo]] N5 ===\\nPublic transport to the site of Waterloo battlefield are deficient, so hitchhiking could be a solution for th ose who wish to do a day excursion to that historic site.  The best is to reach Ter Cameren Bos (Bois de la Cambre) at the border between Ixelles and Ukkel \\'\\'(Tram 94 - 23 - 24) and find a spot along the Chaussee de Waterloo\\'\\' {{Coords|50.811928|4.368154|1}} or by taking [http://maps.google.be/?ie=UTF8&ll=50.789497,4.374205&spn=0.000717,0.001725&t=h&z=19 Tram 92 till \"Fort Jaco\" terminus], and then walk to adjacent Chaussee de Waterloo to hh further south.\\n\\n=== Northeast or East, towards [[Leuven]], [[Antwerpen|Antwerp]], [[Liège|Liege]], [[Germany]], [[Netherlands]] {{E|40}} / {{E|314}} ===\\n====Option 1====\\nStart hitching at the entrance of the Tunnel located at the gate of the Jubelpark/Parc du Cinquentenaire on the Blijde-Inkomstlaan/Avenue de la Joyeuse-Entrée on the side of the \\'Rond-Point Schuman\\' (metro access 1A/1B direction Herrmann-Debroux/Stokkel). There is a street light and a side parking just at the entrance of the tunnel, you may simply stand by the light with a sign and the cars can immediately pull over to pick you. This hitching point is an easy start to go to Leuven or Liege or possibly reach the Heverlee services in Leuven on the E40 or on the E314.\\n\\n====Option 2==== \\nAnother good option is to hitch at the red lights on the [http://maps.google.be/maps?f=q&hl=nl&geocode=&q=rue+du+belliard+10+,+bruxelles&sll=50.84508,4.369297&sspn=0.010351,0.026608&ie=UTF8&ll=50.844945,4.368825&spn=0.010704,0.026608&z=15&iwloc=addr Rue du Belliard]. It\\'s a one way street with 4 lanes and most cars enter the tunnel at the end of the street that goes onto the motorway towards Leuven, Liege and Aachen. Make sure to ask your driver if they go onto the motorway and go towards Leuven. The first petrol station on the motorway is right after the exit to Leuven. If your driver goes to Leuven he can miss his turn and still go to the town through the petrol station. Nearby public transportation to this second hitching spot are Metro station \"Trone/Troon\" and also several bus lines.\\n\\n\\n====Option 3==== \\nGet to premetro Station \"Diamant\". You can get there by taking the metro to Schuman (Direction 1/5 Stockel/Hermann-Debroux) and change then to bus 79 (direction Kraainem) or take tram no. 25 from Rogier in direction of Boondaal Station/Gare Boondael. Cross \"Bld. Auguste Reyers\" in eastern direction. Then walk to the spot on the small street, just after the traffic lights, that leads to the A3-motorway. There is plenty of space for cars to pull over.\\n\\n====Option 4====\\nThe best way to leave the city fast and in the right direction is going past the ring road. So, if you\\'re ok to pay the public transport, take the [https://www.delijn.be/fr/lijnen/lijn/3/351/2 De Lijn bus 351] from the train station Brussels-North and stop at [http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=15/50.8744/4.4931 Nossegem - Centrum] (it takes 30 minutes and cost 3 euros). Walk a few metres in the direction of the bus and you reach a big crossroad where the highway is announced. Follow the sign and turn right to find a very comfortable point to hitchhike to Leuven or Liege\\n\\n====Option 5====\\nStand by the roundabout next to the parking lot entrance to the Cora supermarket, in Woluwe. From the Roodebeek metro station, walk 15min or take bus 45 to Gulledelle.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Antwerpen|Antwerp]], [[Breda]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Utrecht]], [[Amsterdam]] A12 or {{E|19}} ===\\n====Option 1==== \\nTake tram 3, 19, or 23 and get off at \\'\\'De Wand\\'\\' or take tram 4 and get off at \\'\\'Esplanade\\'\\' (and then turn right). Walk along the Avenue de Meysse up to Antwerpselaan, crossing Romeinsesteenweg. By now you should see the signs for Antwerp. Keep following the signs for a couple more roads further on. This will increase your chances when you hitch on Antwerpselaan and try to catch a car that would get onto the motorway at junction 2 of the A12. De Lijn busstop \"Strombeek-Bever Nieuwelaan\" is good, cars are going slow and have place to stop. \\n\\n====Option 2==== \\nTake metro 6 in the direction of \\'\\'Koning Boudewijn/Roi Baudoin\\'\\' and get off at \\'\\'Heysel\\'\\'. Take Keizerin Charlottelaan/Avenue Impératrice Charlotte to the right in the direction of Brussels Expo. Continue along Avenue de Miramar (so don\\'t go to the atomium) and turn left at the end where you will see highway A12 in front of you. Take the next to the right and go under the bridge. Start hitchhiking just after the bridge at the street on your left (Antwerpselaan). \\n\\nIf you don\\'t have any luck with finding a spot to stand you can try your chances at Brussels Airport. You can take bus 21 to the airport and then go to the \"Départ\" area. Go outside and you will see a lot of cars drive by and drop off people who are catching a plane. When you walk a bit into the direction where the cars are going to (it\\'s one-way traffic) you will find a good spot where you can stand and where cars can stop for you. Use a sign, because probably most cars will move into Brussels and only a few will go to Antwerpen. This road will lead to the highway and also to the petrol station that is described at the section on Brussels Airport.\\n\\n\\n====Option 3, NATO====\\nThe [http://maps.google.com/?q=nato,+brussels&ie=UTF8&hq=nato,&hnear=Brussels,+Belgium&ll=50.877674,4.42263&spn=0.004008,0.009645&z=17&iwloc=lyrftr:m,0x47c3dcd1ea2536c7:0xe8a6c0992aa12ff7,50.877511,4.421042 bus stop in front of the NATO] is pretty good for hitchhiking further than Antwerp, although there is more traffic at the parallel traffic lights. For hitchhiking to Holland, make a sign for the Antwerp/E19 and get off at the petrol station just before Antwerp: lots of Dutch cars / people here to ask for a ride. If someone takes you to Mechelen though, make sure they drop you of at Mechelen Noord motorway exit. Buses 12, 21 and 65 go to the Nato stop. You can get the number 65 from the Madou metro stop.\\n\\n====Option 4, Airport====\\nTake an overpriced train or for a more normal price bus 12 or 21 to Brussels International Airport. There are many exits at the airport. You can find one and start hitching from where cars pay their parking-ticket. A bit further down the road towards the motorway you\\'ll find a Shell service station. Most cars here stay around the airport, but you may have luck. A final suggestion is to keep on walking along the side-road until it joins with the motorway. Cars go relatively slow here and there is plenty of room for a vehicle to pull over.\\n\\nIn order to get to the airport there are different options:<br>\\nThe fast but expensive (8,5€) direct train to Brussels Airport from Bruxelles Midi, Central or Nord.<br>\\nSTIB/MIVB bus #12 or #21 leaving from Place de Luxembourg (4€), be sure to check the timetable and keep the traffic jams during rush hour in mind<br>\\nDe Lijn bus #272 or #471 leaving from Gare du Nord/Noordstation (normal ticket price around 2€)<br>\\nTake a normal priced train to Zaventem Station and walk 2 km to the airport. When you leave the station, take the Vilvoordelaan straight till the second roundabout and follow the road to Brussels airport (there is a pedestrian road next to the highway).\\n\\n====Option 5, Notre Dame Cathedral / Laeken====\\nA relatively good spot in the North-West of Brussels can be found around the corner of Parvis Notre Dame, the Cathedral of Laeken. You can reach this by metro L6 towards Koning Boudewijn and get off at Bockstael Metro station. Turn left when you exit and go through Rue Leopold I, or just follow the pedestrian street-signs for the Cathedral. Tram 94 also apparantly stops close to the cathedral (not confirmed).

If you get from the highway onto the 5, walk or ask the driver to bring you 2km in direction of the city center (towards the M51). After you pass the M51 there will be a MOL petrol station. Behind the petrol station is the bus number 66. This one will go inside the city and will bring you to the next metro station, too.\\n\\n\\n== Hitching out ==\\n\\nThese directions are for leaving the city centre. See [[Budapest Ferihegy international airport]] for hitching from there.\\n\\n\\n=== Northwest towards [[Bratislava]], [[Vienna]] M1 {{E|60}} & Southwest towards [[Zagreb]] M7 {{E|71}}, Lake Balaton ===\\n\\n==== Option 1: Motorway service station M1/M7 (OMV) - \\'\\'\\'Kelenföld\\'\\'\\' ====\\n\\nThis petrol station is the most popular spot with hitchhikers in all of Budapest, many young people use it to go to Balaton.. It is at the very beginning of the motorway that splits after a few kms into motorways M1 and M7. Some cars stop here only for the McD, so positioning yourself somewhere at the exit and thumbing or holding a sign works well. Asking around at the gas station is even better, ignore the clerks telling you to thumb.\\n\\nThere is another petrol station around 200m down the road, but it gets so little traffic that it is not worth going there.\\n\\nWays to get there:\\n\\n# Take bus 8E from \\'\\'Keleti pályaudvar\\'\\' (Keleti train station) in the direction of Kelenföld vasútállomás M, (and change at BAH-csomópont for bus 139), or take bus 139 from \\'\\'Széll Kálmán tér\\'\\' in the direction of Gazdagréti tér, and get off at \\'\\'Nagyszeben út\\'\\' (not Nagyszeben tér!). Walk back 100m east in the direction the bus came from along Budaörsi út and you will see the OMV petrol station and McD on the right.\\n\\n# Take metro 4 from \\'\\'Keleti pályaudvar\\'\\' to the last stop \\'\\'Kelenföld vasútállomás\\'\\'. Walk through the underpass and up the steps in northwest direction. Continue along the footpath till you reach the main road Budaörsi út. Cross the main road and turn left and walk west for 250m along Budaörsi út till you reach the OMV petrol station / McD.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Personal experiences\\'\\'\\'\\n\\n\\'\\'A friend and I wanted to hitchhike to Vienna from here. Upon arriving, we encountered a couple of other hitchhikers going to Balaton. We found a single seat going to Vienna within 30 mins. Upon speaking to the other hitchhikers, I found them a ride within five minutes by asking at the gas station. Another hitchhiker arrived and together we found a ride to the Austrian border within an hour. - [[User:Rebew|Rebew]] (Aug. 2021)\\'\\'\\n\\n\\'\\'I was able to get a ride in under an hour going to directly to Vienna. It was early morning so there wasn\\'t that much traffic (1 car every 2-3 minutes) but seems like a good spot. I think it\\'s worth holding out for a ride across the border if you don\\'t want to end up in Western Hungary somewhere. I had a sign saying \"Wien\" but the ride was from a Hungarian. - [[User:AloysiusDente|AloysiusDente]] (March 2024)\\'\\'\\n\\n==== Option 2: OMV petrol station BAH-csomópont ====\\n\\nTake bus 8E, 110, 112 from \\'\\'Keleti pályaudvar\\'\\', or 139, 140, 140A from \\'\\'Széll Kálmán tér\\'\\', in direction of Kelenföld vasútállomás M and get off at \\'\\'BAH-csomópont\\'\\'. Alternatively, trams 17 and 61 stop here. Also, you can walk ≈4.5km west from Keleti train station to the beginning of \\'\\'Budaörsi út\\'\\'.<br/ >\\nThis place is relatively close to the center and there is a lot of traffic to the M1 and M7. It appears like this is the only option in the list that nobody has specifically spoken against. \\n\\n==== Option 3: Motorway service station M1/M7 (Agip) \\'\\'\\'Budaörs\\'\\'\\' ====\\n\\nTake metro 4 from \\'\\'Keleti pályaudvar\\'\\' to the last stop \\'\\'Kelenföld vasútállomás\\'\\'. Take bus 172 or 173 and get off at stop \\'\\'Budaörs, benzinkút\\'\\', which is right at the Agip service station. It has a lot of traffic to both motorways and can be a great place if you get a chance to talk to drivers, though the staff of the petrol station may not allow it. \\n\\n==== Option 4: Motorway service station M1 \\'\\'\\'Biatorbagy\\'\\'\\' ==== \\n\\nTake metro 4 from \\'\\'Keleti pályaudvar\\'\\' to the last stop \\'\\'Kelenföld vasútállomás\\'\\'. Then take a local train to \\'\\'Biatorbagy\\'\\' (it costs about EUR 1 (HUF 370)). From the station, turn right for 20m, and then right again at the roundabout under the railway tracks along Dózsa György út for ≈350m until you reach a main road. Turn left (northwest) and follow this national road 1 for 2km to a turning on the right. Walk north along this road for ≈750m under the motorway bridge to the service station on the north side of the motorway.If you are ready to invest some time to get to the first petrol station after the motorway splits, you should do so because it is a perfect spot as essentially all the cars there are going towards Vienna/Bratislava.\\n\\n==== Option 5: Various spots near the city centre ====\\n\\nStarting from inside the city (between Moszkva tér and Kelenföld) is a possibility worth trying, especially because there are some good spots that are quite popular among local hitchhikers. Pros are that you don\\'t need to spend any money on transport; cons are that there is a lot of local traffic and so waiting times could be very long. (In real nobody will take you, go out to the edge of the city).\\n\\n=== South towards [[Szeged]], [[Serbia]], [[Arad]] ([[Romania]]) (M5) {{E|75}} ===\\n\\n==== Option 1: Gyáli út ====\\n\\nTake tram 4 or 6 to \\'\\'Boráros tér\\'\\', then take bus number 54 or 55 to the stop \\'\\'Gyáli út\\'\\'. Walk straight for 75 m and then turn left on the street \\'\\'Gyáli út\\'\\'. After about 150 m there is a curve in the road, turn right there and walk to the motorway (it\\'s not yet a motorway officially, so you can hitchhike there). There is no road or pavement leading there, but it\\'s easy to cross. You will see a half complete ramp on your right going on the motorway. It\\'s basicaly a 100 meters long lane with no traffic on it, it\\'s ideal for cars to stop, and you are also visible from a long distance. As of January 2017, there is some construction which leaves no space for stopping except on the exit lane of the petrol station nearby. The spot still worked quite well\\n\\n==== Option 2: Petrol Station OMV on Nagykőrösi út ====\\n\\nTake tram 4 or 6 to \\'\\'Boráros tér\\'\\', then take bus 54 or 55 to the stop \\'\\'Radnó utca\\'\\'. There is a petrol station on the other side of the noise barrier wall. You could also thumb at the bus stop on the bus-only lane. If you want to go any further, option 3 is about 800 meters down the road.\\n\\n\\'\\'I got a ride to a rest station near Kecskemét within 30 minutes. My driver told me that thumbing at the bus station would\\'ve been a better idea. Kecskemét was good to hitchhike, but the tourists are annoying. This is also a perfect route to go to Kosovo, as 90% of drivers will be going there. - Rebew (30/07/2021)\\'\\'\\n\\n==== Option 3: Start of M5 motorway ====\\n\\nTake the metro to \\'\\'Határ út\\'\\'. Then take bus [http://www.bkv.hu/busz/84e.html #84E], [http://www.bkv.hu/busz/89e.html #89E] or [http://www.bkv.hu/busz/294e.html #294E] to the stop \\'\\'Naszód utca (Használtcikk piac)\\'\\'. Here you can start to hitch (you should see a Citroen car lot on the other side of the road. A sign \"Szeged\" is useful. If you take bus 84E, you can continue straight onto the motorway to a OMV petrol station that you can hitch from. (This information is unconfirmed; maybe this is the OMV in option 2.)\\n\\n==== Option 4: Motorway service station M5 Inárcs ====\\n\\nTake the metro 3 to \\'\\'Népliget\\'\\'. Take bus [http://www.volanbusz.hu/en/timetable/lines/line/?menetrend=2204 Volánbusz 608] to \\'\\'Inárcsi elág (M5-ös út)\\'\\'. After approximately 30km, it will leave the motorway and go to Inárcs. Remember the way and get off the bus at the first stop (shortly past where the town starts) and walk back to the OMV petrol station where the bus left the motorway. Take care, because there is no sidewalk and cars/trucks can be quite fast. It is the first big petrol station on M5 after Budapest [http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=16/47.2750/19.3289] and there will be cars and trucks to all the southerly destinations - just ask around. You can look for foreign plates if you want to leave the country.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Érd]], [[Pécs]] (6, M6) {{European Route Number|73}} ===\\n\\nTake tram 61 from near train station \\'\\'Déli Pályaudvar\\'\\', or tram 6 from \\'\\'Blaha Lujza tér.\\'\\', or bus 7 from \\'\\'Ferenciek tere\\'\\', to \\'\\'Móricz Zsigmond körtér\\'\\'. From here, cross the street and walk on for about 20m. Take bus 33 or 33A and get off at \\'\\'Budatétényi Sorompó\\'\\' (the stop after the big shopping mall Campona on your left). From the bus stop, turn back and walk in the direction the bus just came from. Cross the street at the first crossing to your right (Növény ut.). That street has a railway overpass that crosses over it. Walk under the overpass and in a couple of minutes you\\'ll arrive at a busy road. This is road #6 that goes south to Pécs. Turn left on that road and start hitching before the traffic light near the bus stop. There is enough room for cars to pull over there.\\n\\nIf you take bus 33, you can go until the last stop (\\'\\'Nagytétény, Chinoin\\'\\'). Walk forward (east) for 200 m and then turn left to the ramp which leads you to a roundabout. There is an entry to the M6 here where you can thumb.\\n\\nFor food, bathroom, and buses, get dropped of at the Tesco in Pécs. There\\'s a bus station there where cars can stop.\\n\\n\\n=== East towards [[Miskolc]], [[Košice]] ([[Slovakia]]), [[Ukraine]] (M3) {{European Route Number|71}} ===\\n\\n==== Option 1: Junction & Petrol station on M3 bevezető ====\\n\\nTake trolleybus [http://www.bkk.hu/en/timetables/#74 74] from \\'\\'Károly körút (Astoria M)\\'\\' near Astoria metro station. Get off at \\'\\'Sárrét park\\'\\'. Turn back in the direction from where the trolleybus came from and walk ≈50m along Ungvár ut. Turn right and walk 200m along Rákosszeg park to the end. Turn right on Kacsóh Pongrác út. and walk 100m to the entrance slip road, or turn left on Kacsóh Pongrác út. and walk 50m to the OMV petrol station.\\n\\n==== Option 2: M3 Junction ==== \\n\\nTake bus 7, 7E, 8E, 108E, or 133E from \\'\\'Blaha Lujza tér\\'\\' and get off at the last stop \\'\\'Újpalota, Nyírpalota út\\'\\'. Walk northwest 1km along Szentmihályi út. to the sliproad at the beginning of the M3 proper. It\\'s not the best hitchhiking spot, but it works after a while. If you get stuck here, walk 2km along the motorway to the service station.\\n\\n==== Option 3: M3 Junction Mogyoród ====\\n\\nTake metro 2 to the last stop \\'\\'Örs Vezér tér\\'\\'. From the HÉV (regional train station), take train 8 in the direction \\'Gödöllő\\' and get off at \\'\\'Mogyoród\\'\\'. From the station, walk left 20m on Vasút ut. Turn right and walk ≈400m along Gödöllői ut. Then turn right and walk ≈500m along Szadai út. until you reach the entrance sliproad to the M3 motorway on the right. Alternatively, two kilometres further on, there is also a petrol station on the motorway.\\n\\n==== Option 4: Motorway service station M3 ====\\nTake bus 5 from \\'\\'Blaha Lujza tér\\'\\' in the direction of Rákospalota, Kossuth utca and get off at \\'\\'Juhos utca\\'\\'. Walk ≈450m northeast along Régi Fóti út. You will see a Lidl supermarket on the right. Turn right on the small road and walk southeast for 1km crossing over the motorway bridge. (You can see the service station on the left from the bridge). Take the first road left after the bridge and walk ≈700m until you see the big Praktiker store. Turn left and walk through the car park to the end and jump over the small-ish fence and once past the road, you will be on the petrol station. There is a McDonalds and KFC here too.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'\\'\\'\\'Option 5:\\'\\'\\'\\'\\'\\' Kacsóh Pongrác út bus station\\'\\'\\'\\'\\'\\' \\n\\nTake M1 to Mexikói út metro station and cross the railways in the underpass to the Róbert Károly körút where you will find Kacsóh Pongrác út bus station. It\\'s a very safe place to stop and it is directly before the entrance to the M3 highway. (Waiting time as a woman 10-15 min, hichhiked many times here)\\n\\n\\n=== East towards [[Szolnok]], [[Debrecen]], [[Oradea]] ([[Romania]]) {{European Route Number|60}}, (4) ===\\n\\n==== Option 1: Agip petrol station on national road 4 ====\\n\\nTake metro 3 to the end of the line at \\'\\'Kőbánya-Kispest\\'\\'. Walk to the bus station on the other side of the #4 road. Take the airport bus 200E and get off at the second to last stop before the airport: \\'\\'Vecsés-nyugat\\'\\'. Walk back along the road ≈600m and you will reach the Agip petrol station & McDonalds.<br/ >\\n\\n==== Option 2: Üllő roundabout & MOL petrol station ====\\n\\nTake a regional train from train station \\'\\'Nyugati Pályaudvar\\'\\' to \\'\\'Üllő\\'\\' (550 HUF and 30 min ride). Walk ≈700m southwest on Deák Ferenc ut. till you reach the main road through the town Pesti út. Turn left (southeast) here and walk 2km along Pesti út to the large roundabout and MOL petrol station at the end of town. You can also hitch 100m past the roundabout on national road 4; although there\\'s no shoulder, there is some space for cars to pull over and stop. 20/09/17 Tried option 1 for 3 hours and then went to option 2, waited maybe 30min.\\n\\n=== Option 3:  M3 Highway for Debrecen ===\\n\\nTake a subway till station Mexicói út after walk 4 km ( it\\'s pretty far and I saw a bus  25, but didn\\'t check from where is it going ) till you cross Ozman utca( or around it) it will be a gas station OMV, the road is going among M3 highway, and here some cars are going to a gas station from Highway to this road and back to the highway, and also there is a bus stop after a gas station, where is very convenient to stop the car.\\n\\n\\n=== North towards [[Slovakia]], [[Kraków]] ([[Poland]]) M2 {{European Route Number|77}} ===\\n\\n[[File:vacifoti.jpg|thumb|right|220 px| The bus stop at the Váci-Fóti intersection]]\\n\\n==== Option 1: Motorway Junction Sződliget ====\\n\\nTake a train from \\'\\'Nyugati Pályaudvar\\'\\' in the direction of Vac and and get off at \\'\\'Sződliget\\'\\' (HUF 550/EUR 2 and 30 min ride). Walk south along the platform to the road (Dunai fasor). Turn left (east) and walk ≈400m to the entrance sliiproad over the motorway bridge. Stand on the motorway hitchhiking instead of the sliproad as there\\'s a lot of space to pull over and people don\\'t really drive too fast at that stretch of the road. \\n\\n==== Option 2: Motorway service station (Shell) ====\\n\\nTake a train from \\'\\'Nyugati Pályaudvar\\'\\' to \"Dunakeszi Gyártelep\\u200e\" (HUF 150/300) and walk 3.5 km to the petrol station on the E77 (Hungarians call it Road Number Two). The walk is 40+ minutes but its pretty straightforward - check this [http://goo.gl/maps/bCKPV map]. From Pipa st. you can see the sign of the petrol station in the distance, and it will help you to navigate.\\n\\nThe motorway only has two lanes and cars are going pretty slow, so it\\'s not a problem to cross it. Once you get there its great spot to catch a long drive! You can be picky, so best wait for someone going straight to Poland because once you get to the Slovak border, the road is getting bad and this is your best shot. \\n\\nIf you\\'re heading to [[Poland]], you\\'d most likely be better off finding a direct lift to Poland from the Hungarian- Slovak border rather than getting short lifts through Slovakia. Trucks go until the Chyzne border crossing between Slovakia and Poland, where it\\'s easy to get a lift to Krakow or further to Warsaw.\\n\\n\\n== Public Transport ==\\n\\nBudapest has an extensive public transportation system consisting of a metro, buses and trams. A single ticket is about 1.15 (a set of 10 tickets is about EUR 9.90). After you buy your ticket, you have to validate it. There are red machines on buses and trams that punch a hole in a different place on your ticket each day, which is how they determine if you validated your ticket that day (or at least not the day before...). \\n\\nInspections on buses and trams are rare except for the most popular lines (e.g. buses 7, 7E, 173 and 173E and trams 2 (very frequent), 4 and 6). Rush hours are usually safe when the trams/buses are too crowded for the inspectors to walk through the vehicles. If you want to be safe, hang around the machine and if you see an inspector coming, punch your ticket immediately. You can usually also get off the carriage when you see inspectors getting on as usually at least some of them will wear uniforms. \\n\\nBe careful: the system has changed, and the controllers are often escorted with a public area inspector who has the right to stop you and demand for your ID cards.\\'\\n\\nIn the metro there are inspectors posted at the entrance to the platforms during all operational hours who will demand to see your ticket. Most of the time they check those who are entering and don\\'t bother with people who are leaving the platform (Keleti railway station is one notable exception), so if you see no conductors at the entrance then you are fine. Either you take your chance that there will be no checking at the exit, or take the bus/tram, you can get pretty much everywhere without the metro. Oftentimes you can also just walk past these inspectors at the entrance or flash them a used ticket without stopping. Be careful changing lines at Deák Ferenc tér, usually there are controllers on stations of Line 2 and 3. \\n\\nIf you get caught without a valid ticket, the official fine on the spot is HUF 8,000, which is about EUR 27. Do not let yourself be fooled with another amount, it is HUF 8,000, and the received paper is valid for travelling that day. But if you are cool enough you can get away without paying at all. On the trams and buses the inspectors legally aren\\'t allowed to touch you. Avoid speaking English or German to the controllers. Instead, pick the most obscure language you know and keep them busy until the next stop. When the doors open, simply exit the tram and walk away. Never give the controllers your ID or passport. Maybe try searching for it or your ticket until the next stop, then get off the tram/bus then. Some of the controllers will try to take you to a cash machine if you say you have no money. Same system applies - simply walk away from the controller. I\\'ve also heard of people stalling the controller for so long that the controller gets bored and walks away.\\n\\nAt around 20:30 or later, the ticket inspectors that stand at the entrance to the metro go home, meaning you can get on the metro for free. Be aware also that if they have controls while you exit the station, they announce it as you get off the train and again every 2 minutes or so (\"Please have your tickets ready for inspection as you leave the station.\") If this happens, simply get back on the next train and get off a stop before or after your chosen stop. Do not try and run past any inspectors if they have a control -- they are notoriously aggressive and will have no problem chasing you.\\n\\nOn the green line there are security guards stationed on the platforms, but don\\'t worry, they won\\'t check your tickets. They\\'re just a security precaution. The same thing applies on tram 4 or 6 at night (they run 24 hours). They will stand at some entrances to the tram and check peoples\\' tickets as they enter the tram (They\\'ll be wearing either a yellow vest or a green armband.) Choose a different entrance and you\\'ll be fine, because the controllers stand at one door and don\\'t move through the tram.\\n\\nFor finding connections between two points in the city, there\\'s a very good route planner available also in English: [http://www.bkk.hu/en/timetables/ http://www.bkk.hu/en ]\\n\\nThere is a [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0373981/ very good Hungarian movie] about the controllers on Budapest\\'s public transportation. Finding English subtitles is easy, too.\\n\\n\\n== Sleeping  ==\\n\\nIf you want to sleep outside in summer, you can do so anywhere in Buda hills. These places are abandoned after dark, far from people, and sometimes used by homeless people. \\n\\nIn case the weather outside is not very warm nor welcoming, the mall Duna Plaza, in the northern part of the city XIII district, metro stop Gyongyosi utza offer great opportunities to find a shelter and not being discovered by security guards. In a cold night of november I found a perfect spot to lay down on his mat and sleep, behind the high bar of a closed (but open..) pub on the 2nd floor, next to the restaurants, emergency exit stairs on the back, at the highest floors are also a good option. Toilets are closed at night and security go around to check when they close the building around 02:00.\\n\\nAnother safe option for the winter time would be the \\'\\'\\'airport\\'\\'\\' - unfortunately you can’t blackride the bus that goes there since the driver checks everyone, but the combined ticket for the Metro and the bus is 530 HUF (~1,15€). If you buy the ticket from the driver instad of the vending machine, it’s 600 HUF. The staff doesn’t care about the people sleeping there and no one checks if you have a flight ticket. Might also be a good option if you’re planning on hitchhiking from there in the morning.\\n\\n== Food ==\\n\\nAt Allee shopping centre (metro stop Újbuda Központ, green line. Tram 4 and 6 too) on the top floor there is a large food court where it\\'s possible to table dive. Also at Kőbánya Kispest (last stop on the M3 blue line) there is a large shopping centre beside the train station. There\\'s a large food court on the top floor also where you can table dive. \\nAlso in the Corvin Plaza there\\'s a food court on the top floor to table dive.\\n\\nTry the market at Újbuda Központ (Vásárlócsarnok) and you can maybe get some free vegetables from the sellers there.\\n\\nAt Örs vezér tere, there\\'s an IKEA with a great food court. Just take a left after you come up the stairs to avoid all the showrooms unless you enjoy playing there to raise your appetite :-) \\n\\nOn the top floor of the central market at Fovam ter, there are many food stalls, popular among tourists, most of whom are ignorant fuckers who order what they want but not what they need, i.e. A LOT of leftovers on the table. There are public tables where these fuckers eat and they are not frequently cleaned by workers, thus easy opportunity for table diving. Please do this, even just once or twice. I have seen big sandwiches and baked potatoes and such being left after a single bite. We should make wasting food a crime.\\n\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n{{Excellent}}\\n{{IsIn|Hungary}}\\n\\n[[Category:Hungary]]\\n[[Category:E60]]\\n[[Category:E75]]\\n[[Category:E71]]\\n[[Category:E77]]\\n\\n[[de:Budapest]]\\n[[fr:Budapest]]\\n[[ru:Будапешт]]',\n",

It's a good country for hitchhikers since this was a common way of traveling in socialist times when few people had cars. There are hardly any roads where hitchhiking would be prohibited. Except for a few stretches of true motorway, it is possible to thumb directly on the road and stop passing cars.\\n\\nHitching is slightly easier from the east to the west or vice versa because the motorway [[Sofia]]-[[Plovdiv]] is a part of the main route from Western and Central Europe to [[Turkey]]. Hitchhiking between the north and south is somewhat slower\\n\\nQuite a few drivers who would pick up hitchhikers are those who used to hitchhike themselves back in the socialist regime days. They will often feel nostalgic about the time they spent on the road, and will be happy to share their adventure stories with you, or let you tell them about your trip(s). Hitchhiking is highly popular in the summer and is so common along the seaside that you can find yourself competing with other hitchhikers. Hitchhiking is also practiced and known in Bulgarian mountainous areas, especially around the Rhodope Mountains (''Rodopi'', or ''Rodopa'') where there are very few cars but the ones that drive by usually stop.\\n\\nThere are usually many truck drivers on this road who are willing to have some company. Do not be surprised if some of them – driving long distances between Western Europe and [[Turkey]] – ask you to take off your shoes when you are in a driver's cabin, or show you photos of their family, etc. Note that in summer, on days when the temperature goes above 35\\xa0℃, trucks must remain at a parking place between 1300 and 2100 (to avoid damaging the asphalt). So, in July and August it is best to start hitchhiking early in the morning if you want to depend on truck traffic.\\n\\n[[File:Bulgaria-donkey-hitch.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[User:Guaka|guaka]] and his donkey hitching towards [[Istanbul]]]]\\n== Cities ==\\n* [[Balchik]]\\n* [[Burgas]]\\n* [[Hisarya]]\\n* [[Madara]]\\n* [[Pavlikeni]]\\n* [[Plovdiv]]\\n* [[Ruse]]\\n* [[Sevlievo]]\\n* [[Sofia]]\\n* [[Varna]]\\n* [[Veliko Tarnovo]]\\n\\n== Safety ==\\n[[File:Dangerzone.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Danger!]]\\nAs friendly as they can be, Bulgarian drivers usually don't consider small violations of existing road regulations and speed limits in Bulgaria a big deal. Be careful and avoid standing in areas with a yellow triangle sign, with a filled black circle in the middle - these indicate places with increased concentration of road accidents and are a part of a governmental campaign to improve driving safety.\\n\\nBe wary of thieves - particularly in rural areas, there are many people who see a lone hitchhiker as an opportunity to gain by foul means.\\n\\n== Border crossing ==\\n\\nBulgaria is probably the most corrupt country in the EU, and you are most likely to notice this at the border crossings. However, if you carry a Western passport it is quite unlikely they will bother you.\\n\\n=== [[Turkey]] ===\\n\\n* When going towards Turkey , the most used border checkpoint is the [[Kapitan Andreevo-Kapıkule border crossing]].\\n\\n* The checkpoint near [[Malko Tarnovo]] can also be used if you're coming from [[Burgas]], although there is significantly less traffic there, either on the Turkish and on the Bulgarian side. The border checkpoint lies in a mountainous area so be sure you either have a direct ride to a city on the other side of the border or arrive early, because it could also be hard to find a spot to put up a tent. Traffic is very scarse, but when the border police goes to or from their shift at the border they might take you. It is recommended to cross the border in a personal car, since the truck queue is usually slow, and the Turks might not like you walking around looking for another ride - especially if you do it [[hitchhiking at night|at night]]. When coming from the Turkish side however, it is very easy and accepted to walk across this border - show your passport to the Turkish guards, they stamp it and you're allowed to walk into Bulgaria. On the Bulgarian side the passport controls tend to be very quickly if you're from a EU-country - they just take a look at your passport and you can go. \\n'''Tip:''' when taking this bordercrossing when entering Bulgaria, it might be a good idea to start walking after you've crossed it, because many people won't stop for you when you're standing just behind the border office buildings. Even a few hundred meters will enlarge your changes of getting a ride to at least the next town, which is [[Malko Tarnovo]].There are enough options to set up a tent near this village, and there is a cheap but good hotel too, in the north-western part of the town.\\n\\n=== [[Romania]] ===\\n* [[Ruse-Giurgiu border crossing]], the main border crossing and the route used by trucks.\\n* [[Calafat-Vidin border crossing]], a lesser-used border crossing .\\n* [[Durankulak-Vama Veche border crossing|Durankulak-Vama Veche]], along the Black Sea, the least-used border crossing where waiting times can be long.\\n\\n=== [[Serbia]] ===\\n\\n* [[Kalotina-Dimitrovgrad border crossing]], the main border crossing.\\n\\n=== [[North Macedonia]] ===\\n* [[Kriva Palanka-Kyustendil border crossing|Kriva Palanka-Kyustendil]], in the north\\n* [[Delchevo-Blagoevgrad border crossing|Delchevo-Blagoevgrad]], in the south.\\n\\n=== [[Greece]] ===\\n\\n== Phrasebook ==\\n'''Vocabulary'''\\n* Hitchhiking - автостоп [av-to-stop]\\n* Motorway - магистрала [ma-gee-stra-la]\\n* Petrol station - бензиностанция [ben-zee-no-stan-tsee-ya]\\n* Ring road - околовръстно (шосе) [o-ko-lo-vrast-no (sho-sse)]\\n* Map - карта [kar-ta]\\n* Bus stop - (автобусна) спирка [(av-to-bus-na) speer-ka]\\n\\n'''Greetings'''\\n* Hello - Здравейте  [Zdra-vey-te] \\n* Good day - Добър ден [Do-bar den]\\n* Good morning - Добро утро [Do-bro oot-ro]\\n* Good evening - Добър вечер [Do-bar ve-cher]\\n* Goodbye - Довиждане [Do-vizh-da-ne]\\n* Bye - Чао - ''ciao'' (as in Italian)\\n* Thank you - Благодаря [Bla-go-da-rya] \\n* Thanks - Мерси - ''merci'' (as in French)\\n\\n'''Directions'''\\n* From - от [ot]\\n* Towards - към [kam]\\n* Through - през [prez]\\n* (To the) left - (На) ляво [(Nah) lya-vo]\\n* (To the) right - (На) дясно [(Nah) dyass-no]\\n* Straignt on - Направо (Nah-pra-vo)\\n\\n* Where are you going to? - На къде отивате?

Probably road networks changed, and after checking the map, we understood that people know start from the center and take the A1 by the south (from Plaza Rey). We decided to take a blablacar, but better spot to go to Vitoria / San Sebastian may be around Plaza Rey or the main streets in the center.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n{{IsIn|Spain}}\\n\\n\\n[[Category:Spain]]',\n",

As with most cities, hitchhiking is easy once at the outskirts; its just getting there and finding that initial spot that can be tricky. Public transit is $3.00 for 90 minutes.\\n\\nCalgary is located not far from [[Banff|Banff National Park]].\\n\\n== Hitchhiking Out ==\\n=== North towards [[Airdrie]], [[Red Deer]] ([[Edmonton]]) ===\\n* Hitching North out of \\'\\'\\'Calgary\\'\\'\\' can be hard. There are a lot of commuters traveling between \\'\\'\\'Calgary\\'\\'\\', and [[Airdrie]], but they are mostly interested in getting to work, or getting home so they may not be so accommodating. [http://www.airdrie.ca/index.cfm?serviceID=54 Airdrie City Transit] has an Intercity Express that travels between the cities about 10 times a day. The fare is $8.00. These buses stop at downtown Calgary, and the McKnight west winds LRT station. Hitch hiking north out of \\'\\'\\'Airdie\\'\\'\\' will be much easier.\\n* The easiest way to get out of the city is find a friend and get a lift to the tiny town of Balzac just North of the city. Then, one simply has to find the highway intersection (traffic-light controlled) and start hitching. For those without friends with cars, one could take public transport to the intersection of Country Hills Blvd NE and the Deerfoot Trail using googlemaps to find a route. Coming from down town, the best way is to take a NE train to McKnight station, and then take the 100 bus route. Once at the intersection, one could either begin to hitchhike or hail a cab and spend some hard earned cash getting to Balzac and going from there.\\n* You can get to the airport by Bus 300 ($3) and then just walk back following the Airport Trail to Highway 2 (Deerfoot Trail). The ramp has not much of traffic, but as you walk further North to the Country Hills Blvd NE the shoulder gets wide enough.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Strathmore]], [[Medicine Hat]] ([[Regina]]) ===\\nGoing East one can take a NE train to Rundle station, then take bus number 48 to the intersection of Stoney Trail NE and the Trans Canada Hwy. It should then be easy to get a ride from the onramp. The better onramp is probably the one that branches East off of Stoney Trail NE as the cars are going slower and (for Calgary) its a largish intersection.\\nIf you don\\'t mind walking a little bit, around 1.5km further along the highway from the above-mentioned onramp there is a set of traffic lights. Head down to just before where the road branches off to the right, and cars are traveling slow, and all the eastbound traffic along the TransCanada is passing you. Best have a big sign.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Okotoks]], [[Lethbridge]], [[Carway Border Crossing|US Border]] ===\\nSouth is one of the easier directions to hitchhike as its fairly easy to get to an onramp. There are two spots to consider.\\n\\nThe first (and possibly better) option is the onramp at the intersection of the Deetfoot Trail and Cranston Ave SE. Get here by taking a Southbound train to Somerset station (last stop) and then taking the 406 to Cranston and Canarch SE, and then finally walking to the highway.\\n\\nThe second option is the onramp at Macleod Trail and 194 Ave SE. One would assume this option would have less traffic than the other, but it is still possible. Taking bus 78 after leaving the Somerset train station will get you within a couple blocks of the onramp and you can start hitchhiking.\\n\\n=== West towards [[Canmore]], [[Banff]] ([[Kamloops]]) ===\\nWest is tricky. There is a community called Valley Ridge that public transport can get you to. From there you could hitchhike at the onramp to the Transcanada Hwy. However, there may be limited traffic coming from here, the majority of rides not offering to go very far. There is a pull off about 500m west of this overpass that can work very well. It is highly visible, and there is plenty of room for cars to pull off. One could get here by taking a NW train to Crowfoot station (last stop) and then taking bus 408 to Valley Ridge.\\n\\nAnother option would be to start thumbing at the traffic light at the bottom of Canada Olympic Park. This option is likely more favourable, and has been mentioned before. The traffic light is at the junction of the Transcanada and Bowfort Rd NW. The transit instructions are the same as above, however, one should get off the bus on Bowfort road, before the intersection with the Transcanada.\\n\\nTook about 2 hours (hitched out twice Oct 2024) hitching from the shell in front of Bowfort road. Very few cars stopped but were headed in different directions. Asked around at the gas station tooo thats how i got rides both timess:  ride to [[Sicamous]] once, and to [[Canmore]]. Managed to thumb to Banff and back on a day trip\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n[[Category:Alberta]]\\n[[Category:Canada]]\\n__NOTOC__\\n{{IsIn|:Alberta}}',\n",

From here it is around 15 minutes walk to the entrance to the motorway north.\\n\\nTry just after the mini roundabout where Fen Causeway meets Newnham Road- there are places for cars to stop and it takes you to the larger roads which head to the M11 in both directions. I hitched from here to the ramp going to the M11 after waiting about 20 minutes, and have seen others do the same. It's about 15 minutes' walk from the town centre.\\n\\n=== West-North-West towards [[Huntingdon]], [[Birmingham]] ===\\nFrom the town centre walk out north-west until you reach the Huntigdon Road. You can hitch the whole Huntigdon Road as there is enough place for cars to stop on the bikepath. But it may be easier if you walk about 1 mile until you reach a small restaurant on the left side where cars have really good space to pull over (and they not taking the risk to injure a student on a bicycle).\\n\\nTry and get a ride out to the Cambridge Services, about 4/5 miles out of the centre and on the A14 heading to Huntingdon and further north. Once here, it's easy. The service station is huge with a lot of traffic.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Ely]], [[King's Lynn]], [[Dersingham]], A10 ===\\nGo to the Milton Park & Ride (it has a huge Tesco's supermarket..most people know it and should be able to point you in the right direction from the centre of the town). You can walk here without taking a bus quite easily, it's around a thirty minute walk from the centre. Along the way are two Co-op's, one often has amazing amounts of food in the bins, which will be on your right-hand side. Keep walking and you'll pass something like a science park and then you'll see directions for Ely, A10 and so forth. Great space to stand. You could get a ride all the way to King's Lynn if you're patient (about an hour and a half's ride) but surely Ely will take you no longer than ten minutes waiting for.\\n\\n=== South towards [[London]] ===\\nFor heading south on the M11 (towards [[London]] and the M25 motorway, get the Trumpington park and ride service (£3.50 day ticket or £1.90) all the way to the end car park. From there it is about 5 minutes walk to a large [[lay-by]] where cars can stop (just before the roundabout) - it's hugely recommended either having a sign saying London. \\n\\nAlternatively, there is another great spot - [[lay-by]] on the southbound [[slip road]] where vehicles from the A10 join the traffic and can also pull over. Further down the M11 it is not possible to find an area to hitch safely, so this is probably your best bet.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Ipswich]] ===\\nTo head onto the A14, the best bet if you don't want to take a park and ride to Teversham is to walk on Newmarket Road trying to thumb a ride. Its a long walk to the A14, so you should get a ride before getting there, and if you don't then maybe your luck is dispersing for the time, and you should take a break.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[[Category:East of England]]\\n[[Category:E24]]\",\n",

English and French are the two official languages of the country. English, being spoken by 3/4 of the population, is the majority language in most provinces. French is the main official language in the province of Quebec, but also widely spoken in New Brunswick and some areas of Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Manitoba. Inuktitut is the main language in Nunavut and has official status there but English is still widely spoken. For the convenience of the common hitchhiker the provinces and territories are discussed in detail, along with their capitals, in separate pages.\\n\\nFor a journey across the country, the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] is the main road crossing the country east to west. However, the highway system numbering system is specific to every province.\\n\\n=== Car Number Plate ===\\nJust like its southern neighbour, the [[United States of America|United States]], every provinces are issuing their own specific car plates. For example, a car from Manitoba will have a specific [[wikipedia:License plates of Canada|Car licenses]] tagged as such.\\n\\n=== Local attitude ===\\nEven if the country bears some similitude with its southern (and only) neighbour, the [[United States of America|United States]], the cultural and life outlook of the population is markedly unique.\\n\\nThe majority of the Canadian population lives in harmony within their vast country.   The size of the country has allowed people to live using their own beliefs, languages or religion without being bothered by anybody else, in a \\'Live and let live\\' motto.  Therefore, hate crimes are mostly absent and major \\'\\'difference\\'\\' clashes even rarer, but may exist. It might be useful for a traveler to be aware of the current political situation to avoid getting into a discussion which may offend more than anything else.  Sometimes, during such situations, it might not be helpful to hitchhike as a white in a First Nation reserve, or sound French in an English area, or visa versa.  That said, Canadians are generally friendly and forget their stereotypes once they meet you in person.\\n\\nThe rural population will usually be keen to help if the traveler is making the first steps into breaking the \\'stranger in the locality\\' image, as the split between country- and city-folk is also existent. The rural community feeling is usually pretty strong and when people believe you belong there and act more altruistic. However, some rural regions have large populations of urban commuters which has the tendency to bring a more individualistic mentality.\\n\\nIt is worth noting that in Quebec, the carshare website \"AmigoExpress\" is extremely popular. Worth checking out if a bit pressed for time and have a bit of cash to spare. There are more than 50 rides a day between Quebec and Montreal at costs of 10-15 CAD.\\n\\n== [[Winter]] hitchhiking ==\\n\\'\\'\\'Be careful!\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nCanada is a vast country (the second biggest in the world) and many visitors do not realize its size or extremes in temperature prior to arrival. Certain northern rural regions are inhabited by few or even no permanent population, so it might not always be bright to adventure by yourself into some wild or less inhabited part of the country without the proper equipment or having registered yourself to some local authorities prior to such a journey. As a simple reminder, the density of population is about 3.2 habitants/km², and about 75 % of that population lives in the south, nestled by the US border. It is normal in some parts of the country to drive a hundred kilometres without any living soul.\\n\\nWith temperature often dropping beneath −30 Celsius, you should not stand outside more than 15 minutes. It\\'s VERY important to make sure you wear the appropriate gear and take precautions to never be stuck anywhere outside without shelter.\\n\\nIn winter the roads can be icy or narrowed by the snowbank, so it will often be hard for cars to stop by and pull over safely. Drivers won\\'t do it if they don\\'t feel safe as the risk of causing an accident might be too high, and the driver would have to bear entire responsibility of it towards their [[insurance]].  It\\'s even more important in icy conditions to make sure you find a hitching spot where there is good visibility and a safe place to pull over.\\n\\nIn some areas, especially in the northern territories, every citizen is bound by law to provide help and safety to every citizen in need from the hazards of temperature and nature. The reaction towards that will often differ, going from immediate support to a \\'where have you left your brain!?!? being out by this weather!\\'. Your actions may be perceived as quite stupid and irresponsible to have dared outside without being prepared for the weather, as most locals prefer to enjoy the cosiness of their home in winter storms. For that reason, shops, restaurants, or gas stations usually won\\'t kick you off their property in extreme weather. In the summer it\\'s different, and you may be asked to leave if there is no danger from the outside elements.\\n\\n== Personal Experiences ==\\n\\'\\'I have hitchhiked many thousands of miles through most of the provinces. Getting rides is usually slightly easier than the [[United States]], but harder in some places. The cost of food makes travel here very expensive. Border crossing as an American citizen is incredibly frustrating! It usually takes four to six hours of intense interrogation of myself and violation of the privacy of other people in my life. The first time I was held and interrogated for over six hours and eventually turned away because I couldn\\'t provide documentation proving that I had a reason to return to the states; they wanted me to buy a return bus ticket to prove I was only staying a short while, sorry, not happening! Well I got a little crafty with their requirements and subsequent attempts to enter have been easier, heh. You may have to get creative, but where there\\'s a will, there\\'s a way. Don\\'t give up! This is a beautiful country!\\'\\' [[User:Thewindandrain|Thewindandrain]] ([[User talk:Thewindandrain|talk]]) 00:45, 5 June 2013 (CEST)\\n\\nHitchhikernick - I have hitched across the country twice from west to east and been up to Alaska 3 times.  Generally hitching is pretty reasonable though there can be tough spots like I experienced on the north side of lake superior, west coast north of Kitwanga on highway 37, Dempster highway to Inuvik (crazy Japanese guy pulling a cart whilst walking from whitehorse to Tuk and saw two grizzlies straight out of hibernation 10 miles beyond him next to the road) and road to Yellowknife.  Nearly got stuck south of Calgary where temps were about to drop to -40, but managed to convince a truck driver to drive me to Montana, so be well prepared for cold.  Never had issues getting into Canada being a Brit and most overland borders into USA have  been easy going though the border between Seattle and Vancouver can be a little more strict at times. Average waiting time 3hrs.  Most of my hitching has been around BC and it\\'s pretty good there, it\\'s technically illegal but I have never had any issues with cops about this. Be a little careful around Thunder Bay area as few methheads and one driver I got a lift with was windscreen punching loopy.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n{{Provinces Canada}}\\n{{IsIn|North America}}\\n[[Category:Canada| ]]\\n\\n[[de:Kanada]]\\n[[es:Canadá]]\\n[[fr:Canada]]',\n",

Wild camping is generally not allowed, though. Ask landowners for permission to camp in their garden, this should usually work.\\n\\nCarinthia is also quite rural, so you shouldn't face problems to find a quiet spot to camp illegally for a night or two, as long as you don't disturb others. Be careful, in winter it can become very cold: down to -25 degrees celsius.\\n\\n== Other useful info ==\\n\\n=== Internet ===\\n\\nFree Wi-Fi is available at the main railway station in Villach and Klagenfurt. Also the shopping center ''Atrium'' in Villach and the shopping center ''City Arkaden'' in Klagenfurt provide free Wi-Fi. On the A10 motorway between Villach and Salzburg there is also free Wi-Fi available at the service station in Feistritz.\\n\\n=== Service stations ===\\n\\nCheck out the page about [[Crossable rest areas in Austria]] and [http://www.oeamtc.at/portal/raststationen+2500++500411+1938?env=c2VhcmNoPVlteGtQVXZEcEhKdWRHVnU this page] from the Austrian automobil club with a map about the different motorway service stations in Carinthia (and all of Austria).\\n\\n=== Freeriding ===\\n\\nYou can board local busses in the cities of Klagenfurt and Villach easily without paying a ticket. After 20:00h, however, you have to take the front entrance and you can't dodge the fare. There are not a lot of controls. The fee, if you're caught, is 60€ and a photo to be registered in their database, if you can't or won't provide any valid identification. You could also be reported to the police.\\n\\n[[Category:Austria]]\\n[[Category:E55]]\\n[[Category:E61]]\\n[[Category:E66]]\\n{{IsIn|Austria}}\",\n",

It also has delightful secrets to reveal to those who dare visit it like the fact that it is, in fact, possible for over 500 flies to suddenly emerge from previously fly-free sand dunes and sit on one's back, arms, personal belongings and buzz obnoxiously around one's head for as long as one takes to think of a clever plan to trick them and escape. \\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== To Pelican Point ===\\n'''''For camping at the beach just out of town''''' which is slightly illegal, so you'll want to avoid the Rangers (see accommodation and Sleep, below). A nice 20min walk out of the town centre along David Brand Dr to the corner with Babbage Island Rd puts you at a decent corner for hitching. There aren't always many cars driving past, but they stop fairly easily. There is no shade here though, it can be bloody hot in the middle of the day.\\n\\n=== To North West Costal Highway towards everywhere ===\\n'''''For getting out of town to everywhere else north, east or south in [[Australia]].''''' There are two roads out of town towards the highway where you want to go, Robinson Road is your best bet for getting out of town as it is much busier than HMAS Sydney II Memorial Drive (which has a more fun name and rows of also fun palm trees planted along it though). Unfortunately the Gull petrol station in town doesn't like hitchikers and might send you to the BP (miles away!), but trudging along the side of the road looking pitiful in the sun inspired one of the many lovely residents of Carnarvon to pull off the road and give [[User:Dear_sarah|Dear Sarah]] and Kathleen a lift to the highway, so stick your thumb out as you walk. Once at the highway, you can go for North/East or South as you please. \\n\\n== Hitching In ==\\nIts a small town so people will probably not mind dropping you where you want; if you need supplies ask for the centre of town. If you want to go straight to camp at the beach, ask for the road out of town, or they might be happy to take you right there (its only 3-5km). \\n\\n== Accommodation and Sleep ==\\nThere is water by the town, but the proper beach is a little removed and so a good spot to camp as it's not too overrun. Babbage Island Rd out of the town goes past the 1 Mile Jetty, Binning Rd and then down to Pelican Point. \\n\\nThere are a lot of 4wd cars going between 1 Mile Jetty and Binning Rd even at night, so you're better off camping between Binning Rd and Pelican Point. The only shower and toilet block is right at the end of Pelican Point, but there are also more beach-goers there so don't camp too close. The carpark there can be excellent or terrible for hitching back into town.. definitely ask people at their cars to avoid unexpectedly long waits. \\n\\nThe fact that it is somewhat illegal to camp on the beach, and wanting to avoid late-night raucous behaviour by intoxicated folk are two good reasons to be sneaky with your camping. Set up the tent, should you have one, after dark and in as sheltered a dune as you can find. If a car is coming along the beach with a searchlight swinging around, [[User:Dear_sarah|Dear Sarah]] recommends exciting ninja-action to quickly flatten and hide said tent and campers in the dunes. The fine for camping in protected dunes is probably unpleasantly large. Cars or vans left parked overnight at the shower block will also attract unwanted attention. \\n\\nThere aren't any sources of drinking water at the beach, including the shower block, so make sure you have enough. \\n\\n[[File:CarnarvonAus.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The lovely beach at Pelican Point.]]\\n\\n== Other Useful Info ==\\nIn the summer months, it seems to always look like it's about to bucket down with rain on Carnarvon but this rain just swings by south of the town and beach. So, you can enjoy the excitingly foreboding-looking clouds without ending up looking like a drowned rat.\\n\\nIf you need to use the internet, this can be done for a fee at the library or the tourist office - but the tourist office ladies are lovely and friendly, whereas the library lady can be unpleasant and unfriendly. Plus, sometimes they have a basket of delicious free green Chili Peppers to give away at the tourist office.\\n\\nIf you need a power outlet to charge your phone or other electronic device, don't bother asking at various shops which will refuse you. At the building where Woolworths is, there is a kids' Cookie Monster Play machine with a bench next to it. With a little clever arranging, you can unplug the machine, in-plug your stuff, and have a nice little relax on the bench for a while. It might be an idea to try to hide the swapped cables, in the slightly awkward case of actual kids coming and trying to play on the now not-working machine.\\n\\n{{IsIn|Australia}}\\n[[Category:City's]]\\n[[Category:Australia]]\",\n",

At \\'\\'La Bomba del Amparo\\'\\', there is one splitting (Baranquilla-Medellín), if you head down to [[Medellín]] some kilometers there is another turnoff to [[Barranquilla]] and a good place to hitch. \\n\\nAnother option is to take the road to [[Barranquilla]] 4kms past the turnoff to the bus station (Terminal) to a police stopping. Here the cars slow down and often you may get a chance to talk to the drivers.\\n\\nAnother good spot is a gas station (and stamp point) called Florida. There are loads of trucks going to Bogota and to Medellin. Better hours are between 6 and 8 in the morning (better if you sleep there then, you can ask to the restaurant or to the hotel to put your tent somewhere).\\nHow to get there: take a bus to Mamonal from the center of Cartagena, and ask to the driver to let you in the industrial zone, where the mototaxis are. Then take a mototaxi to Florida. Alternatively, you can walk about 6 km till the Florida station. \\nDon\\'t make the mistake to stop in the Dona Cleme station(2km before): that is much smaller and with less traffic.\\n\\n=== Towards [[Panama]] ===\\nThere are 2 marinas in \\'\\'\\'Cartagena\\'\\'\\'.

After we walked ten minutes by the route, this is the route parallel to the sea. We stopped before Hotel Las Américas and before the bridge, we hitchhiked there and we catched a ride directly to Barranquilla after one hour. All the cars are going in that way but you know colombians are a bit afraid to stop, it´s easier when you talk with them. Also if you want you can continue by local bus to Boquilla or Centro Comercial Las Ramblas to find another spot\" - [[User:Patagonia.almundo2018|@patagonia.almundo]]\\n\\n:\"September 2019: Cartagena -> Barranquilla. I followed the instructions to go to the police checkpoint about 2km further from the Terminal. In hindsight it was a mediocre idea. Everybody in Colombia knows police checkpoints are just for the police to make bribe money. So cars won’t stop for you because they fear the police could still check them. And already stopped cars are in a bad mood because they just needed to pay. Also it’s just a mess with all the standing and passing cars so that you wont get noticed well. Way better would be to take a bus out of town to Bayunca and wait behind one of the speed bumps. Alternatively if you could somehow reach the peaje in the middle between Bayunca and Clemencia this would be an optimal point. From then on in every little town there are speed bumps and gas stations where your chances are higher than near Cartagena.\" - [[User:Kaulter|Kaulter]]\\n\\n:\" March 2014 - I took a bus to the bus terminal(as you would expect to do) (which I hasten to add is a cracking place to sleep for the night. Super friendly staff and lots of police, and free Wifi, just sleep on the chairs (movable) to avoid being woken up) . Next morning I walked out through the apocalyptic landscape about 2km to were the road forks north and south. Towards Barranquilla there is a police checkpoint, but they would allow me to stand after it. However, on occasion trucks pull in here to secure loads, and it was with one of those happy chappies that I got a lift north. If you are transiting Barren, take any ride, but swap of  at a busy petrol station to find rides towards Santa Marta as hitching out of B is a pain in the B. Waited 20 minutes here.\" - [[User:Lukeyboy95|Lukeyboy95]]\\n\\n:\"January 2014: Following the instructions above, I took a bus in the direction of Mamonal (a final stop of a bus was Passacaballo). I left a bus in front of Ferreteria Reina and walked towards Peaje. There the road splits: to Baranquilla and to Medellin. I saw also many buses passing there with a direction \"Caracoles\", so probably you can take a bus directly to peaje from city centre. I needed to go to Medellin, and very soon a moto took me and brought to first gas station \"La gran via\", where I stayed for a night. All personal there was very nice and even promised to find a truck for me in the morning.

It is mainly industrial heritage that makes this town special. Same as [[Dresden]], Chemnitz was in 1945 heavily bombarded - which is still visible today as many blocks miss one, two or even more houses in the inner city. There is a handfull of interesting expressionist buildings in Chemnitz so far; mainly from the 1920\\'s as well as 1930\\'s, the times of GDR with it\\'s typical prefabricated socialist highrises, office buildings as well as a concrete hotel tower and conference center (1952-1989), postmodern structures from the 1990\\'s as well as the year 2000. \\n\\nStreets, squares or even quarters with an old German flair (medieval, renaissance or baroque) such as in Eisenach, Gotha or Weimar do not exist in Chemnitz. \\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== Eastwards and Westwards ===\\n\\nThere are two possible places to get out of Chemnitz onto the A4 in eastward (Dresden) and westward ([[Jena]], [[Weimar]], [[Erfurt]], [[Kassel]], [[Frankfurt]]) direction.\\n\\nFrom Chemnitz \\'Zentralhaltestelle\\', take bus number 21 (CHEMNITZ CENTER) (Note: this is a shopping mall - not the city centre!) to \\'Heidelberger Straße\\'. On the B95, there are two petrol stations (Aral and JET) where you will easily find drivers that go to Dresden or Leipzig. There is also a McD restaurant before the bridge over autobahn A4 (E 40) and a Burger King restaurant behind the bridge of A4. To reach those place from the city-center it should not take longer than 10 to 15 minutes.\\n\\nAnother good spot is \\'Rastanlage Auerswalder Blick\\' to go east or west on A4 / E 40. From the city center of Chemnitz (\\'Zentralhaltestelle\\'), take bus number 22 to the final stop GLÖSA and change there to bus number 63 (EBERSDORF). Get off at busstop \\'Corinthstraße\\'. Continue walking behind the bus on \\'Schmidt-Rottluff-Straße\\' and \\'Chemnitzer Landstraße\\' in eastward direction for about 20 minutes to reach the southern (eastward) Rastanlage ([[Auerswalder Blick Süd]]). To reach the other side, change after 10 minutes walking on \\'Schmidt-Rottluff-Straße\\' on \\'Liebemannstraße\\' (north) and the tunnel underneath A4 / E40 to reach the northern (westward) Rastanlage ([[Auerswalder Blick Nord]]). To reach both places it should not take longer than 45 minutes from the center of Chemnitz.\\n\\n=== Southwards ({{Autobahn|72}} - [[Hof]], [[Nürnberg]]) ===\\n\\nTake bus number 23 from Zentralhaltestelle to Neefepark. Get out at the bus stop \"Pasteurstraße\". You can stand with a sign next to the bus stop where drivers can easily stop. I would suggest to have a sign with the next city \"Plauen\" on it. I have the impression that it is more likely that people take you there. Just before Plauen there is a Petrol station and \"Raststätte\" where you can find drivers who go further south.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Personal experience 2019\\'\\'\\'\\n[[AnnieK]] hitchhiked from here a lot towards A9 or A93 at any time of the day. I never used a sign, many drivers stop (~ every 15min) but most go towards Leipzigor don\\'t go as far as Plauen. If someone goes even only as far as Stollberg, take the ride if you\\'re desperate! There is a parking lot with free toilets on the Autobahn where you might find people going a bit further. \\n\\n=== Northwards ({{Autobahn|72}} - [[Leipzig]]) ===\\n\\nUse the same advice as in going South (busstop Pasteurstraße) since the A72 is going in both directions, north and south. Usually more people stop at the busstop who go towards Leipzig. \\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n[[Category:E40]]\\n\\n[[de:Chemnitz]]',\n",

I took a bus to Dujiangyan. In 2010 you could still see a lot of the destruction of the 2008 earthquake. But the trucks take you with them for free, and they are more comfortable than any bus.\\n\\n== Going North ==\\nTowards Xi\\'an and Mongolia take public bus #60 from the city centre. There\\'s a stop about two blocks from Flip Flop Lounge Hostel called \"Xinnanmen Bus Station\", which despite it\\'s name is just a bus stop. It\\'s only 2 yuan and starts at 7am and runs approximately every ten minutes. The bus will have few people on it in this direction in the morning. On the internet the bus is stated to take over two hours to get to 狮子村 (Shīzi cūn), the stop after 同乐村 (Tóng lè cūn), but in the morning it seems to take less time than this. There is no button to stop the bus so you might have to yell out to the driver to stop at the next stop or ask another passenger to help you. Don\\'t expect any passengers to know English though. The bus has a digital display and voice announcing the next two stops.\\n\\nThe bus stop is just next to a bridge going over the expressway. A large locked iron gate seems to block your walk to the tollgate and petrol station but just around the concrete building there is an open gate you can walk through.\\n\\nHippietrail got a ride in a few minutes without even making a sign using the thumb gesture and a smile in the space between the petrol station and the slow moving traffic coming from the tollgate which is visible to all drivers.\\n\\n== Going South ==\\nGoing south towards Leshan you will want to get on a bus heading for the airport, and get off by the Homeland Hotel about 4 km before the airport. From there you turn left (with your back to the hotel), and walk over the airport express road with the heavy traffic. Soon you can get on the G4301 (ringroad), where you walk for a few km before you can turn right onto the G5. Just after the tollgate there is a gas station with a lot of cars filling up their tanks for a looong ride south who all want you to come along! Great hitching spot, although it takes some time to get there.\\nYou can check buses going to the airport here http://www.cdairport.com/front_en/jt4.jsp I took the metro to the south railway station (2-3 RMB), from there I took a city bus 300, walked a while from the train station to find it, and they got me off the right place.   \\n\\nAnother option towards Leshan and Ya\\'an is getting to the Shangliu Tollgate. Take subway number 1 (2-5 yuan) to its terminal station, Guangdu (don\\'t you love terminal stations?). Get out at exit A, turn left and walk until the really big avenue (Tianfu Ave.), cross it and immediately turn left (still on Tianfu, just on the other side). Walk a couple hundred meters to 4th Huayang Ave, on which you\\'ll find the 828 bus stop (1 yuan). It basically goes in a straight line all the way to the toll gate, the ride there takes about half an hour. Keep your eyes open for the Gao Su above you, and it\\'s time to get off. You can hitch before the toll gate or in the gas station right next to it. The highways to Leshan and Ya\\'an/Yunnan split a few KMs south of here.\\n(August 2017: I took exactly that advice and went to the toll gate, within 10 sec. I had a ride!, great spot!)\\n \\nIf you are going south (towards Yunnan) or west (towards Kangding and Litang), you can also get a bus to Pujiang from the Xinnanmen Bus Station located in the city center. Tickets are 27RMB (approx. $4.50). The bus station in Pujiang is a 5 minute walk to the highway where you should be able to find a ride.\\nAsk the driver if he\\'s going on the Chengya Gaosu, that\\'s the highway between CHENGdu and YA\\'an. \"Ni wang chengya gaosu neibian ma?\". \\n\\nDo not try to go to the beginning of G5-road. Havy traffic and no way for cars to stop!\\n\\nChengdu is the gateway to Tibetan Sichuan. The hitchhiking situation changes completely. Any people take you with them and the cities are small, so you can walk out easy.

An important point of junction in Chiapas is [[Arriaga]].\\n\\nMany tourist visit cities like [[San Cristobal]], [[Comitán]] and [[Palenque]], so the locals are used to see foreigners and they will try to practice their English with anyone carrying a backpack. Even if you\\'re also Mexican.\\n\\nCan be sometimes hard to hitch but definitely worth a visit. Chiapas has a lot on offer from historical Mayan sites and waterfalls to jungles and mountains further south. Unfortunately the locals know this and most of the natural beauty is locked up and requires an entrance fee. Go explore if you can pay… or be creative and find uncontrolled paths through the forest.\\n\\nIf you\\'re up for an adventure, consider hitching the \\'\\'Carretera Fronteriza\\'\\' that follows the Guatemalan border from near Comitán to near Palenque. There are numerous beautiful places along the way some of which unfortunately you have to pay for accessing -- like the Lagunas de Montebello -- but some of which you can visit and camp at for free, such as the beautiful wild Ixcan river at the \\'\\'Puente de Ixcan\\'\\' river crossing. Traffic is very sparse here and due to the dubious security situation not everybody is happy to pick you up, so you shouldn\\'t expect to make more than 50 kilometers a day unless you get a lucky ride. If you have the time (or are willing to take a combi from somewhere on the way if you run out of it), you can have a lot of interesting encounters here with friendly soldiers and indigenous people in the small villages. The landscape is also really beautiful. \\n\\n==Cities==\\n* [[Arriaga]]\\n* [[Comitán]]\\n* [[San Cristóbal de las Casas]]\\n* [[Tuxtla]]\\n* [[Palenque]]\\n\\n{{States Mexico}}\\n{{IsIn|Mexico}}\\n[[Category:Mexico]]',\n",

Walking over the parking area is possible, but take care of the security guys, they\\'ll send you away from the ground for sure. Best is to stand at the ramp just after the truck drivers paid their duty. If you want to try it directly at the motorway next to the border controls, walk down the little slip road for some 50 meters, and you\\'ll find a trap that brings you up to the motorway. [[User:Platschi|Platschi]] was send away there from some cops, but nevertheless it\\'s possible. Good luck :)\\n\\nAlternatively, after the two gas stations the road takes a turn to the left. You will see a traffic light with the truck parking on your right. There is an extra lane with a barrier so just hitch in front of the barrier, as the cars are slowing down. If you want to hitch far and your driver is only going a short distance, demand to be taken to Coldrerio petrol station on the highway.\\n\\n=== Option 2: North/South alternative starting point ===\\nTake the bus Number 1 from Chiasso Train Station to Coldreriora Paese (about 20 min). From the Busstop you walk 10 minutes southwest through the village to Petrol Station \"Easy Stop\".

While the following are localities in the neighbourhood of Cologne: \\'\\'(LEV - GL - SU - BM) clockwise from the North\\'\\'\\n\\nThe whole \\'\\'\\'[[Ruhr Area]]\\'\\'\\' is a well-known pain in the ass for anyone crossing that region. If you observe the motorway system, you\\'ll find out that they zig zag and cross each other in the Ruhr, specially right North of Cologne. There is no \"belt\" motorway around the city, just those zig zags. The flow of cars is highly difficult to predict because cars go from one motorway to another. There are generally 3-4 possible motorways one can take to travel North/South or East/West. It\\'s the most densely populated zone in Germany, so a lot of transport is local or regional, making it even more difficult. Think about it - if you\\'re passing by, avoid getting dropped there!\\n\\n== Hitching In ==\\n\\nWhen you arrive Cologne via the [[A1 (Germany)|A1]], it\\'s difficult to get into the town centre, because the motorway is very far outside. One option is to get off at the exit Köln-Niehl. There is a tram station, close to the motorway, in east direction, 15 minutes walking. At daytime, you can get to the town centre in like 15 minutes.\\n\\nFrom the same motorway ([[A1 (Germany)|A1]]), you may as well get out at Köln-Lövenich and catch Tram #1 on Aachener Straße direction down town at either Bahnstraße or \\'\\'Mohnweg\\'\\' stops.\\n\\nYou could as well try to catch a ride from the A1 onto the A3. And then get off for example at Köln-Dellbrück. There you walk 5min in direction west, catch the bus 159 to Wiener Platz, where can get a tram.\\n\\nComing from the South on the A555 or through the A4, you may as well as the driver to leave you at the Am Verteilerkreis roundabout situated just at the complete end of the A555, at the Kreuz Köln-Süd (Junction A555-A4). The driver can really leave you at a petrol station and gain the motorway back with complete ease. From there, you can walk along the Bonner Straße to catch a bus to the heart of Köln.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n=== South towards [[Bonn]], [[Koblenz]], [[Frankfurt am Main]] ===\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nGo to the Verteilerkreis Sü\\', a big roundabout where all vehicles that are heading for the motorway to the South or West are passing by. There is also a petrol station beside it and a traffic light where one can ask people for a lift.\\n\\nIf you\\'re headed to Frankfurt am Main, take the train to the last stop Königsforst (tram U9), walk straight for about 15 min. Then after a right turn you are on a decent on ramp of the [[A3 (Germany)|A3]], most of the cars will go to Frankfurt am Main or can drop you at least on the Rasthof Siegburg (about 20 km South), which is it worth for long-distance rides.\\n\\n[[File:Dariocraigmalaysia.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[User:Halt, Stop! Reudnitz kommt.|Craig]] & Dario hit the road for Thumbing Asia West to East (Königsforst always a good option!)]]\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nTake the train RB 25 from the main station in the direction Marienheide or Overath for EUR 3.20. Leave at Stümpen and turn right and go up to the Kiefernweg and turn right. Follow the street that is later called Dammelsfurther Weg up to the Pestalozziweg for maybe 500 meters and turn right. Now you pass the Autobahn and turn right again in the Plantage. Follow this way a few hundred meters through the forest and you will see a Shell service station on the right side. Maybe you have to climb a fence. Now you are on the a station without oil station but much traffic and it\\'s easy to get a ride there. It takes approximately 40 minutes to reach it from Cologne Hbf (main train station).\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nTraffic lights at the ramp Köln-Dellbrück (Mülheim/Buchheim) or at the ramp onto the 55a (Frankfurterstraße). Ask the driver to bring you at least on the Rasthof Siegburg. To Köln-Dellbrück you can catch the bus 159 in direction Buchheim to\\'Gronauerstraße for example at Wiener Platz (3 stops). To the ramp at Frankfurterstraße take bus 151, 152 or 153 to Beuthenerstraße\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 4\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nPetrol station in Koeln Muelheim. Take the tram 4 to \"Muelheim Berlinerstr\" (or any of the Busses to the same stop). Turn left, then the first right into \"Rixdorfer Strasse\". Follow to the end till you come to an Aral petrol station to your left. Not so much traffic on the petrol station, so better to stand next to the road with a sign. It`s a good spot for people who start in the north of Koeln. Most of the traffic will at least pass \"Koenigsforst West\", and probably the service station \"Siegburg West\" as well. Make sure to ask though, because people going to Siegburg often get off the junktion before \"Siegburg West\".\\nHad an average waiting time of 10 to 15 min (2022).\\n\\n\\n=== North or East towards [[Berlin]], [[Dortmund]], [[Hannover]] and [[Münster]] ===\\n\\nHitching in that direction seems to be legendarily difficult unless you take a regional train and walk an hour. Several experienced hitchhikers got trapped countless hours and decided to take a train instead. Nevertheless it\\'s of course possible to hitch out of Cologne, experiences about this vary extremely. \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\' \\n\\nClose to the city, you may want to try one of the on-ramps in the North East of Cologne. On-ramp Köln-Dellbrück (exit 26 on the [[A3 (Germany)|A3]]) seems to be good for hitchhiking in direction Remscheid or further along the A1. Also traffic North the A3 passes here. There\\'s no hard shoulder but some green space to stop cars ~60m behind the Autobahn sign. Another possibility is to ask the drivers directly at the traffic light with an extra lane for the motorway. You can get there by taking the metro U18 to Holweide-Vischeringstrasse, cross the railways towards the main road and to the left you\\'ll find the on-ramp. Or Follow the description for Köln-Dellbrück (see south towards). You just have to walk a bit more. Make sure to have a Remscheid or RS sign in case of going towards A1 because there is only one tiny resting area ahead of the A3/A1 crossing\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\' \\n\\nIt\\'s also possible to hitch from the South East of the city because there is a petrol station on the A59. The closest bus stop is Eil Heumarer, bus #152. You can take it from Steinstr. S-Bahn, which is relatively close from the main station.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3\\'\\'\\'  \\n\\nIn case you try to use a ramp from Cologne, a good take-off sign is Remscheid, because the first service area on the [[A1 (Germany)|A1]] is Rasthof Remscheid, just before the exit for Remscheid. There are lots of commuters. You can also get there by train from Cologne Dom/Hbf for 6,50 Euros via Remscheid Hbf and walk 5 km to the area (map [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=Remscheid+Hbf&daddr=Unknown+road&hl=en&geocode=FTLnDAMdiNttAClRpZsmWyq5RzGlIfHuvHkWrQ%3BFayeDAMdfEduAA&mra=dme&mrcr=0&mrsp=1&sz=15&dirflg=w&sll=51.157143,7.226601&sspn=0.008559,0.023174&ie=UTF8&ll=51.169872,7.215099&spn=0.034228,0.092697&t=h&z=13 here]). If you\\'re lucky, catch the bus 672 or 673 (valid with your zone 4 ticket) to Talsperre/Mebusmühle or Talsperre/Raststätte (closer but only 673) and avoid the walk. These buses do not pass very often, though.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 4\\'\\'\\' \\n\\nThere is also the possibility to take the bus nr 260 from the central station towards Remscheid. Get off at the bus stop Kaltenherberg Ort, From there you just have to walk for about 2 minutes, the motorway is already visible. All drivers that pass can at least take you to the petrol station in Remscheid which is just about a few kilometres from there. Like that you avoid the ring and are straight on the A1.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 5\\'\\'\\' \\n\\nCrossing of the A57 and the Parkgurtel ring road. Get there using the S-Bahn get off at station Nussbaumstrasse and walk direction east until you get to the traffic lights. All the people turning left are going on A57 and there\\'s a good chance they\\'re heading on the A1 later. Like mentioned above, ask for Remscheid service station. The spot is protected from the rain by the train bridge! The cars only stop at the red lights, so you will have to do some jumping around.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 6\\'\\'\\' \\n\\nOn the motorway ring before Cologne, to the west of the city, there is the motorway service area Autobahnparkplatz Frechen. You can reach it by catching a train to Frechen-Königsdorf (around 20 minutes). Turn right on the stairs at the station, walk through the car park, turn left on Augustinus Straße, walk straight for 2 minutes and then turn right on to Marienhöfer Weg. Keep walking up this path into the forest for 5 minutes. Eventually you will come to a crossroad, but take the tunnel under the Autobahn. After, take the first exit on the left. You will eventually reach the Frechen Tankstelle in the direction of Cologne.\\nMany cars come from Aachen or Belgium.

There is an on-ramp. A lot of traffic goes in your direction, but it is very dangerous for drivers to stop there.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nFor direction Krefeld/Nijmegen riding the S-bahn to Worringen and try it from there, average waiting time around 30-60 minutes.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3: Nievenheim Ost service station\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nTake the S11 train to Nievenheim, it\\'s about 40 min from Köln Hbf. From there, you can either walk, or take bus WE2 to Edisonstraße. It\\'s a 20 min walk to service station Nievenheim Ost from the bus stop. \\n\\nStick to the streets and don\\'t trust the satellite imagery where a small path is visible between the bridge over the highway and the access road. It is traversable but not worth it as you don\\'t save much time, and you\\'d technically be trespassing.\\n\\nOnce you arrive at the service station you can climb through the big hole in the fence or just continue walking on the access road to the chapel in the southern part of the service station. It is accessible on foot.\\n\\nThere is not a lot of traffic on weekends but it\\'s the safest and most reliable option I found for getting to the Netherlands from Cologne. You should be able to find a ride by asking around.\\n\\n=== West towards [[Aachen]], [[Maastricht]], [[Eindhoven]] and [[Belgium]] ===\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nOn the motorway ring around Cologne, to the west of the city, there\\'s the motorway service area Autobahnparkplatz Frechen Ri. AK Kerpen. You can reach it by catching a train to Frechen-Königsdorf (around 20 minutes). Turn right on the stairs at the station, walk through the car park, turn left on Augustinus Straße, walk straight for 2 minutes and then turn right on to Marienhöfer Weg. Keep walking up this path into the forest for 5 minutes. Eventually you will come to a crossroad with the service station on the left.\\n\\nThere you can get lifts to the Netherlands, Belgium and United Kingdom from one of around 200. Trucks are going in the direction of Aachen or Maastricht, at least.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nGo near the [[A4 (Germany)|A4]], Exit 11a Klettenberg and 11b Köln-Eifeltor. When at the latest, walking slightly North there is an extra lane that looks like an ideal place for people to stop, and slightly South of it is a big truck stop and petrol station where you can try and ask people. To reach these exits from the centre, take the tram U18 to Efferen (for 11a) or to Eifelwall and then bus 138 to Güterverkehrszentrum. This option is especially interesting to know if you get trapped in Cologne while trying to cross the Ruhr area.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|North Rhine-Westphalia}}\\n\\n[[Category:North Rhine-Westphalia]]\\n[[Category:Germany]]\\n\\n[[de:Köln]]',\n",

If you choose the option towards Malmö then use one of the options below. If you\\'re hitchhiking from Germany or elsewhere in Denmark, it\\'s probably easier to first get to the airport and then find a ride going into Sweden, rather than trying to get a direct ride from before Copenhagen.\\n\\n==== Option 1: Kastrup Airport ====\\nThe best spot to hitchhike to Sweden is probably at Kastrup Airport. Take the metro to the station \"Lufthavnen / Copenhagen Airport\", or rent a bike (donkey republic is cheap, there is usually a place you can offload a bike in the airport. At the slip road going over the bridge to Sweden there is a wide hard shoulder where cars can pull over. While the visibility could be better, it works and any car that stops will get you to Sweden. Alternatively:,leave the terminal on the other side of the metro exit to the large parking lot and then go to the roundabout at the end, next to McDonalds/Netto/Statoil. Just after the roundabout there is a bus stop were the cars are able stop, which makes it a good place to hitchhike from. You will also be able to keep an eye on the petrol station and hopefully spot some cars with Swedish plates from that place. This hitchhiking spot has been used regularly by Öresund hitchhikers and was also the winning choice in a Copenhagen-Malmö hitchhiking competition.\\n\\nIf you are in a hurry you shouldn\\'t accept rides that are shorter than Malmö, since it could be difficult to catch a ride along the motorway (hang on, there isn’t anywhere on the motorway to stop before Malmö anyway, just a giant bridge). Always try to stay out of Malmö\\'s motorway network and if possible prefer to follow your driver into Malmö center if there\\'s no other alternative. It\\'s much better to hitchhike Malmö\\'s good spot (McDonalds at Stockholmsvägen) than the highway system. If you want to travel further up in Sweden you should check out the advices given in the Sweden(Malmö)section..\\n\\nUnder the airport there\\'s a train station with trains going to Hyllie station and then to other stations in Malmo, so use it if it\\'s the only option left. There might be a ticket check on the train, so if you\\'re like me, you risk facing a giant fine, but in my case luckily a cute girl checking tickets did nothing. They check your ID when you enter the station in Copenhagen and when you exit in Sweden due to the immigration issues.\\n\\n==== Option 2: Tårnby ====\\nOn the road to Malmö, leading to the bridge, you might be able to hitch a ride. To get to this spot take a regional train to Tårnby from Copenhagen Central station.  The slip road to the bridge is on the opposite side of the road to Tårnby station.  Not much space to stop but as traffic lights cars are going slow and get chance to think about it! \\n\\n==== Option 3: Sydhavn ====\\nYou can also take a train to Sydhavn, only 2 stops after the main station and hitch on Sydhavnsgade. We hitched before the shell service station because it was a weekend and a business carpark entry was closed. We also saw people with a sign just after shell. Its a good road. \\n\\n==== Malmö ring road for those heading north toward [[Gothenburg]] or [[Stockholm]]====\\nBear in mind that the Malmö ring road has no good places for hitchhike on it. There are a few on ramps with gasstations but at all of them getting stuck happens somewhat easily, ofcourse you will always find a ride somehow. One option that can work well is if you are heading further north and get a ride towards Lund (20 km from the highway) it is possible to accept the rideoffer to Lund and get dropped of in the northwest end of Lund and hitchhhiing north west from Lund back to the highway. This works really well and quickly in comparison to the ringroad onramps.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Helsingør]], [[Sweden]], [[Stockholm]], , [[Gothenburg]] ===\\nAnother option for going to Sweden is heading north to Helsingør and catching the 20 minute ferry to Helsingborg from there.\\n\\nTake bus 4A and get off at Vibenshus Runddel. On Lyngbyvej the cars have lots of space to stop, and the road becomes a highway shortly after. There is not at lot of traffic on the small on-ramps on the way to Helsingör, so try to get a ride all the way from Copenhagen to Helsingör. A sign might be of use.\\n\\nIt cost around 29 kr. (3,90 euro) to walk on the ferry, but you can hitchhike a ride onto the ferry, often finding a direct ride to Gothenburg or Stockholm (It seems that most of the people Go to Gothenburg If they take this ferry) , by standing in front of the ticket booth with a sign of your destination. the cars pay for 9 passengers included in every ticket, so they can take you for free onto the ferry. Still Valid 2022.\\n\\n\\n=== West towards [[Roskilde]], [[Fyn]] or [[Jylland]] ===\\nThere are several ways of getting out of Copenhagen . Just make sure you do not get stuck at Køge. If you do get stuck at Køge, your best bet is the Tesla Supercharger Station behind the gas station, or at the top of the on ramp immediately east of the last roundabout. Heading west you have the following options:\\n\\n==== Option 1 ====\\nCatch either S-tog A, E or F and get off at \\'\\'Ny Ellebjerg\\'\\' station. Walk through the little alley on the south side of the station called \\'Pylestikket\\'. Turn right on the main road and after a few hundred metres you\\'ll reach the road \\'\\'Folehaven\\'\\'. There you\\'ll see a few traffic lights to slow down the cars. Cross the road and there\\'s  and plenty of space for cars to pull over. \\n\\nThere\\'s even a new official hitchhiking stop (\"Blafferstoppested\") close to \\'\\'Folehaven 84\\'\\', but there are only few cars passing by. So better walk pass it a few hundred meters and you\\'ll see the petrol station mentioned before close to the beginning of motorway 21 (there is a traffic light, so the cars are slow) or try one of the many busstops.\\n\\nIf nobody stops, you could also walk some 100m behind the traffic light to the hard shoulder where the motorway begins. In case they are not going in the direction, where you want, ask them if they can drop you off at Karlslunde petrol station - a good petrol station, before the highway splits south and west. \\n\\n===== Option 1a =====\\n[[File:Spot copenhagen.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Hitchhiking spot at \\'\\'Folehaven/Vigerslevvej\\'\\', an option is to stand on the hard shoulder at the beginning of the motorway you can see in the background]] \\n\\nAn easier way to get to the same spot mentioned in option 1 is to take bus \\'\\'#A1 Avedøre\\'\\' to \\'\\'Folehaven/Vigerslevvej\\'\\'. There\\' you\\'ll see the crossing to \\'\\'Folehaven\\'\\' which is the beginning of the motorway 21. Additionally you can take to following busses also going that direction. Make sure you get out at \\'\\'Folehaven/Vigerslevvej\\'\\': bus \\'\\'#10 Flintholm St.\\'\\', \\'\\'#133 Avedøre St.\\'\\', \\'\\'#65E Avedøre St.\\'\\' There\\'s a petrol station some meters before the crossing. You\\'ll also find a bus stop where you can stand on, or just pull out your thumb on the hard shoulder next to the street. A sign saying the direction might be helpful. Keep in mind that traffic might be pretty fast here already\\n\\n===== Option 1b  =====\\nOne way out of Copenhagen which we found quite quick was to catch the suburban train from Copenhagen Central Statio to Tärnby.  There is an entrance to the E20 headed west there, on the same side of the road as the train station.  There is not lots of space to stop but as there are traffic lights the cars are going slow and get chance to see you.\\n\\n==== Option 2 ====\\nTake the S-train or walk to \\'\\'Dybbølsbro station\\'\\'. Walk towards the \\'\\'Fisketorvet\\'\\' mall, and just before there will be an on ramp to the highway. This is another one of the 4 official hitchhiking stops (\"Blafferstoppested\") in Copenhagen.\\n\\n==== Option 3 ====\\nCatch a regional train or the metro M1 and get off at \\'\\'Ørestad\\'\\' station. Walk across the parking area of Field\\'s and you\\'ll find the first on-ramp. Be aware that there are two on-ramps joining each other when heading west make sure to be on the most busy one.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Rødby]], [[Germany]] ===\\nUse one of the before mentioned options for going west, or another good option is to take the S-train to Sydhavn and walk south on the Sydhavnsgade, there will be places for cars to stop next to the road, at the Circle K petrol station or at the busstop (Sluseholmen). There is a big petrol station called \\'\\'Karlslunde V\\'\\' before the motorway splits towards west and south. If you get a driver going west, you can jump off here, and find a car going towards \\'\\'Rødby\\'\\'. Have in mind that most people are going west.\\n\\nTaking the ferry at the port of Rødby, which sails to [[Puttgarden]] in Germany is the quickest way to get to mainland Europe. In case you get a ride in a car, the price of the ferry remains the same for a car with up to 4 people, so you don\\'t have to worry about any extra payments that the driver may have to make because of you.\\n\\nIt is preferable to find a car going with the ferry to Germany before reaching \\'\\'Rødby\\'\\', as the ferry operator  sometimes will tell you to go away, even though it\\'s before the check in.\\n\\nMost trucks going anywhere in Europe (including Great Britain) will go this way.\\n\\n\\n== Hitchhiking in ==\\nBoth from [[Malmö]], Sweden, and from [[Hamburg]], [[Lübeck]] or [[Rostock]], Germany, it is a good idea to get out of the car at the Copenhagen airport. From there you can get to the city center by metro. Tickets are 35 DKK (about 4,60 €).\\n\\nHitching a ferry between [[Sjælland]] and [[Jylland]] is possible, too, as you don\\'t pay per person but per car on the ferry. Option #1 mentioned [[#West_towards_Roskilde.2C_Fyn_or_Jylland|above]] is probably the best way for getting a car towards Holbæk and further on to Sj. Odde or Kalundborg. Ferry timetables can be found at [http://www.mols-linien.dk/english Mols-Linien] but they run quite frequently. Be aware that the ferry from [[Kalundborg]] is very slow (about 3 hours to [[Aarhus]]).\\n\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n[[Category:Sjælland]]\\n[[Category:E55]]\\n[[Category:E47]]\\n[[Category:E20]]\\n[[Category:Route Amsterdam - Copenhagen]]\\n\\n[[de:Kopenhagen]]\\n[[tr:Kopenhag]]',\n",

It borders [[Panama]] in the South and [[Nicaragua]] in the North.\\n\\nWhile hitchhiking isn\\'t customary for long distance rides among the local population, it works pretty well in fact, especially close to beaches and in remote areas where there is almost no public transport. Nevertheless it might appear more difficult here than in other neighbouring countries, although it depends where.\\n\\nExcept in remote places, hitchhiking on the back of pick-up trucks like in other Central American countries doesn\\'t work in Costa Rica as it is illegal − the police give high fines for violations of this particular law. Your lifts will come with other sorts of vehicles.\\n\\nHere people refer to hitch-hiking as \\'\\'ride\\'\\', \\'\\'hacer ride\\'\\' and \\'\\'buscar un ride\\'\\' are common expressions.\\n\\n== Borders ==\\n\\nThe border between Costa Rica and Nicaragua has one particularity: the border authorities make it close to hell for any vehicle to cross from Costa Rica to Nicaragua, and trucks bearing a load often have to wait 3 days at the Peñas Blancas border before the paper work get\\'s through to allow them passage. The cue of vehicles in Peñas Blancas is at best several miles long. Entering Costa Rica from Nicaragua takes about 1 minute on the other hand.\\n\\n== Pan-american Highway ==\\n\\nFor hitchhiking the [[Pan-American Highway|Panamerican highway]], waiting times may be longer than on the beaches but are still not bad. Trucks are definitely the best and fastest way to cross the country on the Panamerican, as they travel this road a lot and are almost always going long distances.\\n\\n== Alternative Route ==\\n\\nIf you are hitch-hiking through Cost Rica on the North-south or South-north route, it is well worth while not going down the Panamerican (highway 2) all the way and instead taking the 34 along the pacific coast. A lot of truckers go that way anyhow as it is less hassle and not so mountainous, so if you are lucky enough to find a ride that is crossing the country you might just go that way without having to ask. \\n\\n== General Information ==\\n\\nLike in all of Central America, the dirty-hippy look is not appreciated at all! People here wash every day, wear clean clothes and change them as often as possible. Not doing so is seen as a sign of the utmost disrespect and bad education, and is not recommended if you hope to get anywhere hitch-hiking, however hard it might be to find a shower and some place to dry clothes every day!\\n\\nCompared to the rest of Central America, life in Costa Rica is very, very expensive! This is due to the fact that Costa Ricans pay very high taxes on all purchased goods, and in exchange have good social services and pay hardly no taxes on anything else, including their salaries. Of course, it\\'s a pain for the tourist who never uses anything else than purchased goods...\\n\\n== Cities ==\\n* [[San José (Costa Rica)|San José]]\\n* [[Liberia (Costa Rica)|Liberia]]\\n* [[Limon (Costa Rica)|Puerto Limon]]\\n* [[Puntarenas (Costa Rica)|Puntarenas]]\\n* [[Alajuela (Costa Rica)|Alajuela]]\\n* [[Cartago (Costa Rica)|Cartago]]\\n* [[Heredia (Costa Rica)|Heredia]]\\n* [[San Isidro de El General (Costa Rica)|San Isidro de El General (Pérez Zeledón)]]\\n\\n== Maps ==\\n\\nYou can get simple roadmaps with gas stations for free in the tourist information in [[San José (Costa Rica)|San José]].

It forms a useful junction between routes east, west, north and south. It is a meca for the outdoors, with many Munros nearby, and its location lends itself utility as a base for a wide range of adventures. \\xa0\\n\\n[[File:Crianlarich.jpg|thumb|right|Crianlarich's Main Junction]]\\n\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n\\n===  North and West towards [[Oban]] [[Fort William]]  ===\\nHitching West out of Crianlarich Is an easy task. Hitching north and west you want to use the A 82, Which is the main road headed around the town on a bypass. The best spot for cars to pull over is about 30 minutes walk north of town at Inverherive, Where there is a large driveway cars can pull off into. From here, cars will be going to both [[Oban]] and [[Fort William]]. A sign helps to get drivers to stop, but even without one catching a lift towards any of these destinations shouldn't be a challenge. \\xa0\\n\\n=== East towards [[Perth]], [[Pitlochry]]===\\nTo hitch out of Crianlarich east, you need to be on the A 85. This road runs through Callander, and Stirling, but getting to other destiations from its various junctions is easy. The best place to wait is on the outskirts of Crianlarich just beyond the police station (they wont give you any bother). Here there is a large junction onto a quiet residential street that works well as a place for drivers to turn into, and they will be moving as it is still within the town limits. \\n\\n\\n=== Heading South towards [[Glasgow]] ===\\nHitching to Glasgow is back on the A82 running down the side of Loch Lomond. A beautiful route, that, particularly in summer is extremely busy and easy to hitch on. The chalange is getting to a good place to hitch from. There is a layby on the road south about 2 miles out of the town that is normaly full of hikers and campers. It should be easy to catch and lift from one of these cars headed south, or flag another one down from the main drag. A large sign is helpful here as the cars are moving quite quickly. I have also had luck hitching on my way to this space from the roadside, but as there is no easy place for the cars to turn off your milage may vary. \\n\\n== Food ==\\nCrianlarich is a small place, so options for eating are somewhat limited. There is a convivence store near the station that is open every day and stocks basics. There is also a pub on the main road that serves good meals for a reasonable price. Asides from that, you need to go further afield to find anything more than this.\\n\\n== Public Transportation ==\\nThe village is served by Crianlarich railway station located on the West Highland Line. The routes to Fort William/Mallaig and Oban diverge after this station. Access to the platform is via a flight of stairs from a subway that runs underneath the tracks, from the car park which is slightly lower than the station itself.\\n\\nIt is also served by a Scottish Citylink coach service up to hourly from Glasgow going on about every two hours to either Oban or Fort William.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n{{IsIn|Scotland}}\\n\\n[[Category:Scotland]]\\n\\n[[fr:Crianlarich]]\",\n",

Private cars are very rare and consequently almost everyone hitchhikes. You will see hitchhikers at nearly every crossing, bridge or highway junction. Cuban hitchhikers never use a [[signs|sign]].\\n\\nIf you look like a western tourist everybody want to work as a private taxi for you (which can be expensive). Therefore, before you enter a car, either agree on a price with the driver or tell him that you cannot pay. Your chances of getting a free ride are low especially if don\\'t speak good Spanish. In fact, there is not much traffic in Cuba and there are also a lot of other hitchers on the road, which can make waiting times long. Furthermore hitchers will often be picked up on the back of trucks (together with many other people). The trucks go slow and the roads are sometimes in a bad state.\\n\\nIn Cuba, theoretically, cars are required to pick up hitchhikers. In reality, most cars will not stop (even for Cubans) unless you demonstrate your willingness to pay for the ride by waiving some bills - about 20 pesos (~1 dollar)  for every 100km, so you will see many people standing at the highways waiving money. The best locations to be picked up are the \"puntos amarillos\", which are well-established hitch-hiking spots outside the cities named after yellow officers (\"amarillos\") who stop cars and oblige the driver to give a lift to the people waiting on the street. Do not rely on the officers, as they often are not present, or, if they are physically present, are not helpful at all. Nevertheless you always find many Cubans at the punto amarillos who can help you. The easiest way to find the punto amarillo is to ask Cubans, even in big cities everyone should know where the puntos are. In La Habana, you can take the P7 going from Parque central and after about 30-40 mins you will be close to the punto amarillo on the carretera nacional heading east.\\n\\n[[File:Amarillo.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[User:fabzgy|Fabzgy]] took this pictures while hitchhiking in [[Cuba]], the two guys dressed in yellow pants and shirts are the \"amarillos\"]]\\n\\n== Cities ==\\n* [[Havana]]\\n* [[Santa Clara]]\\n\\n== Hitchhiking a [[hitchhiking a boat|boat]] out of Cuba ==\\n\\nYou can search at the \\'\\'Marina Hemingway\\'\\' (Tel: 204 5088 from La Habana) in Jamanitas, [[La Habana]].\\nYou can get there by taking the P1 Bus to Playa and change there to a Bus to Santa Fe (420). The round trip should cost not more then 0.80 Moneda Nacional.\\n\\nThere are boats leaving to [[Florida]], [[Mexico]] and other [[Caribbean|Caribbean Islands]].\\nHigh Season is from December to March/April but there are always some boats.\\nAsk around at the Port office, these people know who is in the marina and who is planing to leave.\\n\\nNote: The Emigration requires you to go with your captain 72 hours before departure to the Imigration office to enrol you on the list of passengers. If you can\\'t make it 72 hours before departure a little tip might do the trick as well.\\n\\n== Wild Camping ==\\n\\nWhen travelling through Cuba in late 2015, [[User:Bernhard|Bernhard]] thinks that wild camping is no problem at all. Many times all over the internet you will find that camping in the fields can\\'t be done but don\\'t mind those sites. Just like in any other country jump into the bushes when no one is looking. There are a few things to consider though:\\n- It can be quiet tricky since there are often plenty of people walking and cycling along the road, so watch out who is seeing you.\\n- Often the best hiding spots are fenced off with barb wire. If you climb over a fence make sure it is no military area! There are usually handwritten signs if it is.\\n- Watch out for this spiky plant which seems to grow all over Cuba. The spikes are massive and you will badly hurt yourself when not being careful. (For example putting a tent over a small branch which then penetrates tent floor, mattress, sleeping bag, skin. Ouch!)\\n- Do bring anti-mosquito spray. You\\'re welcome.\\n- There are a lot of cowboys on horses out there browsing through the fields. So make sure your spot is cowboy-free (for example that there are no horse droppings around)\\n- Also people with machetes seem to wander around and cutting wood.\\n\\nIf you bring common sense you should be fine.\\n\\n== Illegal casa particulares ==\\n\\nIllegal casa particulares are all over Cuba. But what is it, and how to find it? Basically there are two types of casas. The one with the blue anchor logo and the orange one. The blue one holds a license to have foreigners which pay in CUC. Their houses are typically much nicer and well maintained. Often there is a sign outside with the name of the casa and a \"Rent room\" writing in English. You can book them in advance.\\nAnd then there is the other casa which can (officially) only have Cubans, which will pay in CUP. Their sign will only say \"Hospedaje\". Sometimes it includes \"24h\" and you pay by length in hours of your stay. (You can imagine what this is good for) Usually between 5 to 10 CUC. These rooms sometimes aren\\'t as nice as the official casas though but still alright. Often there is a restaurant attached where you can get food for CUP and there is even lobster on the menu (which is generally only allowed for foreigners and available only in hotels). They may refuse you but often they don\\'t care. Especially if there is no official casa in town. I doubt you can book them in advance since they have no contact details online.\\n\\nAnother type is the home of someone. Ask around in the streets ([[User:Bernhard|Bernhard]] did that usually at those little corner shops where they sell juice and pizza) if they know a casa particular or any other hospedaje available for the night. Sometimes you need to ask a few people but sooner or later there will someone approaching you and tell you to follow them. They bring you to some house where either someone else is living or the person himself. Prices are at around 20 CUC including food. It is save to do since they bring themselves in danger when this comes out since they have no license to offer a room. So if they steal stuff you would go to the police and this would mean the home owner is in bad trouble and could loose his house. Or at least this is what i kept telling myself when following people into small side streets. Do keep your voice down though and don\\'t talk to anybody where you are staying. Speaking Spanish is almost a must and maybe get yourself a Cuban haircut.\\n\\n\\n== Jineteros ==\\nThose are the guys in parks called who can sell you anything, organize you anything and do whatever they need to do to rip you off.\\nHowever, those are also the guys who can make the most impossible happen. They know the city and where to get whatsoever. This might be useful for the one or the other. [[User:Bernhard|Bernhard]] used one to organise him a bicycle in order to cycle around the country. This was surprisingly difficult to find and the knowledge of a jinatero was well appreciated.\\n\\nBe aware though that the Jineteros main goal isn\\'t your wellbeing but rather that you pay him. \\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\n[[File:Katja and Augustas in Cuba.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Hitchhikers [[Katja and Augustas]] on the road in Cuba]]\\n* [http://www.utne.com/webwatch/2006_264/news/12261-1.html Hitchhiking My Way Around Cuba]: Cubans are required to pick up hitchhikers, August 31, 2006\\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090123172523/https://blogs.hitchwiki.org/fabzgy/2008/08/27/merida-mexico/ Hitch a Boat from Cuba to Mexico]: [[User:Fabzgy|Fabzgy]]\\'s experience in 2008.\\n* Waiting On A Deserted Road For Whatever Comes Next [http://glimpse.org/stories/view/waiting-on-a-deserted-road-for-whatever-comes-next/]\\n\\n== Personal Experiences ==\\n\\n[[User:hitchhikernick|hitchhikernick]] hitched in june 2017 for 2 weeks. the route was as follows: havana airport > Havana > west to sandino where i got stuck for 5 hours with no traffic so turned back > havana > trinidad > santiago da cuba > santiago airport where i camped for 3 nights in a bush, full of big crabs, waiting for my flight to haiti.\\n\\nhitched from Havana airport to town where i stayed 1 night in 5$usd hostel with craziest thunderstorm and lightening i have ever seen. \\xa0Then i catched a few of the retro 50s american cars to sandino but called it quits because of no traffic and mosquitos. on the way to trinidad, the highway was super quiet with few cars. \\xa0i got picked up by some nuns who kindly bought me lunch and gave me some money. \\xa0at trinidad i camped on the beach with no problems, just heavy rain but i was sleeping under a table shelter to keep me dry. \\xa0next on way to santiago i had to catch a few busses that were super cheap (1cents per kilometer). \\xa0i camped all the time except for the first night in havana, with no troubles (guys walked around me, one morning, with machetes but no aggression), lots of open space outside Havana. \\xa0i couldn\\'t get enough of the 3-5 cents cold, natural refresco shot sized drinks (non alcoholic). i was eating 50cents mini pizzas all the time. in total i spent 30usd in 2 weeks. \\xa0watch out for pesky kids asking for money and checking your pockets (especially if you are foreign looking). when hitchhiking there were several other people stood under bridges trying to get a ride too, and would just stand infront of me, even had some guys looking disgusted at me asking why i am hitchhiking and have no money. to tackle this problem, i would walk 500meters-1km down the road and get picked up pretty easily. \\xa0average waiting time 1hr. just cars or caught and paid for busses. always make sure you change CUC to CUP at bank, otherwise you will get ripped off by locals as happened to me on first day, though it looks like they did away with CUC since i was there, so much easier.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n{{Caribbean Islands}}\\n\\n[[Category:Island]]\\n[[Category:Cuba]]\\n\\n[[de:Kuba]]\\n[[fr:Cuba]]',\n",

From there, it\\'s very easy to catch a ride north towards the villages in the mountains, even the road towards [[Beirut]] shows up 2–3&nbsp;km later.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Jordan]], [[Bosra]] ===\\nWalk due south from the train station on Nasr street in the New City, near the Marjeh district. You will reach a wide road with signs showing the direction Jordan/[[Daraa]]. Continue walking straight a few kilometers until you reach the spot pictured here.\\n\\nAnother option is to take a minibus down to Al Kiswah, for 100 Syrian pounds (or less).  If you simply mention \"Al Kiswah\" in the city people will make sure you get there.  Make sure to get out of the minibus when it takes the exit from the highway South.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n<gallery>\\nImage:damascushitch1.jpg|Signs showing the direction South\\nImage:Damascus.jpg|Spot in Barzeh direction Northwest\\nImage:damascushitch2.jpg|A good spot to stand for going south\\n</gallery>\\n\\n{{Cities Syria}}\\n__NOTOC__\\n\\n[[Category:Syria]]',\n",

It is not permitted to walk across the border, and any cars going across must have a formal manifest of all passengers.

This is the road (109) going towards Bosra. There's enough space to hitchhike on the bridge that goes over the highway in direction east.

The Israeli and Palestinian side has only one road, Road 90, which continues south towards [[Eilat]] and [[Egypt]], and north towards [[Jerusalem]], [[Tel Aviv]] and northenr Israel ([[Beit She'an]], [[Tiberias]], Sea of Galille, [[Golan Heights]] etc).\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== To [[Jerusalem]] ===\\nWait at any point on Highway 90 (preferably a bus station) head north to the [[Beit Ha'arava Junction]]. Get off at the [[Beit Ha'arava Junction]], and continue at the ''[[trempiada]]'' at the beginning of Highway 1 going west to [[Jerusalem]]. Having said that, most probably your ride will be already going to Jerusalem (most do) so there won't be any need to change rides at Beit Ha'Arava junction. If you do neet to change ride, from Beit HaArava junction it is best to wait for a ride that is going directly to Jerusalem without any stop, unless your goal is not actually to get to Jerusalem, but a town along the way, such as [[Ma'ale Adummim]], in which case there should be people headed there as well.\\n\\n=== To [[Eilat]] and Taba (Egypt) ===\\nJust stand on any point on the road, on the bus station heading south. Continue south till you reach [[Eilat]].\\n\\n=== To the [[The Golan Heights|Golan Heights]] ===\\nWait at any point on Highway 90 (preferably a bus station) head north to the [[Beit Ha'arava Junction]]. From the Beit Ha'arava Junction, head north on highway 90 until you reach the Tsemach Junction at the bottom of the [[Sea of Galilee|Kinneret]] (unless you found a ride that goes directly to northern Israel, e.g. to [[Beit She'an]]). From there, there is a [[trempiada]] up to the [[The Golan Heights|Golan]]. People either drive up to Highway 92 or Highway 98 from there. Highway 98 goes right up to the [[The Golan Heights|Golan]], and Highway 92 runs along the east coast of the Kinneret from where you can pick up Route 789 at the [[Kursi Junction]], or Highway 87 to the [[The Golan Heights|Golan]]. Route 789 connects to Highway 98 from where you can chose to either continue north or head south. Highway 87 also connects to 98, but a bit later, and it also turns west over the Kinneret or east through the center of the [[The Golan Heights|Golan]] until it picks up 98 at its end.\\n\\n== Hitching in ==\\n=== From [[Jerusalem]] ===\\nGet to the [[Jerusalem#French_Hill_junction|French hill junction]]. The place is usually crowded with hitchhikers, and drivers stop often.

Enjoying flying through very unique beautiful forests standing in the back of a utility/pickup/ute/truck. Very friendly people. Spend ten minutes walking out the Roseau as you\\'ll get a lift quicker. Some out of the way areas have very little traffic but 50% will stop for you.\\n\\nHitching is easy and people are very friendly. Watch out for the cars that have TX/HX-plates. They\\'re taxis and might want money.\\n\\nHitching onto boats is best in Portsmouth, as most will anchor there and you can catch them docking at the single pier, whereas Roseau has a little swell and still have up to about 20 international boats and has multiple piers quite distant from each other. Be careful in Portsmouth bay.\\n\\nOne note on couchsurfing, if a local accepts you be prepared that you may never learn their address/hear from them again as the \"Yes means peace\" philosophy runs strong in Dominica. In other words, \"say yes but mean no\", so as to not cause offence and avoid conflict... this of course only makes sense in the short term and does offend/create conflict long term, plus it also leaves you couchless).\\n\\n==Hitchhiking a boat==\\n\\nIf you are looking for a boat heading to The Saints, Marie-Galante or Guadalupe, your best shot would be to look in Portsmouth. Try asking around at the dinghy dock in front of PAYS (Portsmouth Association of Yacht Service), they host a party for sailors on Sunday night. The problem with cruisers in Dominica is that most of them don\\'t really leave their boat, they get picked up by the river tour guys and dropped off at their doorstep. You can try at the ATM located near the Indian River entrance, that\\'s where they take out their cash to pay for the river tour. If you\\'re lucky enough to be staying on a boat while looking for your next ride, don\\'t hesitate to swim from boat to boat and ask where they are heading. \\n\\n[[Category:Caribbean]]\\n\\n==Experience==\\n\\nHitchhikernick- hitched here for week in may 2024. some of the more remote roads (far North to Penville and South through Delices) I had to walk quite a few KM.

They gather at bus stations or just wait at the road until they are picked up.\\nSometimes they hold out their hand or stick out their thumb, but usually they are just standing there as people know what they are waiting for anyway. \\n\\n== Hitchhiking in DR means \"una bola\" ==\\nThe most important word to know for you to make people understand your intention is \"una bola\", pronounced like \"una vola\" which means a ride in Dominican Spanish and also a ball. \\n\\nIf you don\\'t say \"una bola\", many people will just try to find a public or private bus or taxi for you or try to bring you with a motoconcho in exchange for money. \\n\\n== How to hitchhike in DR ==\\n#. Stand by the side of the road.\\n#. Lift up your arm if a car or moto arrives.\\n#. If the driver stops, say \"una bola\" to him and your destination.\\n#. If it\\'s a motorcycle, only get on from the left side. On the right side, there is a hot exhaust pipe. Be careful. If you touch the exhaust pipe with your leg, you will get a Dominican tattoo, a lasting burn injury.\\n\\n== Alternative: Cheap and crowded \"guaguas\" ==\\nThe public transportation system in the country is called guaguas. Guaguas are either pick-up trucks where you sit outside on a wood construction or round and white vans with an open door and 4 people sitting on 3 seats in 4 rows. Occasionally, chickens, bags of rice, clothes and crying children also find their place into the guagua.\\n\\nIn every city there are several guaguas leaving every day and connecting to all possible destinations. The guaguas are really cheap. They cost between 50 and 150 Pesos for one ride.\\n\\n== Why hitchhiking is part of the Dominican culture already ==\\nAs there are no bus schedules, the majority of people also hitchhike as long as the next bus to their destination might come by. An unknown driver  of a car or motorcycle may stop, if a bus can\\'t because it is already full. \\n\\nEveryone in the Dominican Republic hitchhiked once. Many people don\\'t own cars or motorcycles and hitchhike to work every morning.\\n\\nMany people with empty space in the car will pick up hitchhikers. As a white person you get lifts very fast, locals can wait longer, but the atmosphere is nice. Hitchhiking is a normal thing to do in the country.\\n\\n== How to find the perfect hitchhiking spot ==\\n#. Walk along the road until you find shadow.\\n#. Look out for a bus station. Bus stations are commonly used hitching spots and waiting spots for people who try to move to a different place in DR. Bus stations are directly at the side of the road and often in the shadow of some palm trees or buildings. There are these kind of perfect spots all over the country. The buses who are passing by and shouting out their destination, tell you if you stand at the right road. And if you are unlucky hitchhiking, you can still take the next bus or public guagua.\\n\\nIn the middle of the day, its possible to wait longer, as less people are driving long distance when it\\'s really hot, and as it\\'s also not too comfortable waiting in the sun (at least in the hot season), morning or evening hitches are recommendable.\\n\\nPeople will tell you it\\'s very dangerous, but the fact is the Dominican Republic is a comparable safe country of Latin America. Keep a low profile and don\\'t show off expensive smartphones, watches, sunglasses or clothes.\\n\\nCheck out a hitchhiker\\'s personal experience [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhcXDTZ2iJA&index=1&list=PLKvXdnK3gVW0p4OmRNlCnh2v14Xv4vIO_ here on YouTube.]\\n \\n== Sleeping ==\\nDominicans are very friendly and hospitable people and they\\'ll probably invite you by times.\\n\\nThere are a lot of private beaches and areas you can\\'t enter next to the sea, so it\\'s hard to find a nice spot to sleep and camp there, but possible. There are good places to find in the countryside. Usually, there are no problems with the police.\\n\\nIt seems hostels and guest houses are relatively expensive, in Punta Cana a girl recommended me a cheap hostel and it was 20 USD per night.\\n\\nCouchsurfing works super well, also last-minute, you don\\'t have to send too many requests (more than 5), as kind of everybody will invite you who sees the message in time. Dominicans are easy-going and they usually don\\'t mind that you don\\'t know your exact arrival time or date. You\\'ll be welcome.\\n\\nThere are a lot of empty houses and apartments. \"Se alquila\" means for rent and \"se vende\" means for sale. At some places, also along the coast, it\\'s possible to just use them as a shelter for a few days. There is mostly a broken window to find somewhere around the house. Some of them though are already used by Dominicans as a sleeping place. A wooden plate behind an empty window frame is an indicator for an entrance.\\n\\n== Eating ==\\nIn local restaurants, ask for \"plato del dia\", which means plate of the day. You will be provided a typical dominican meal for a cheap price of no more than 150 or 200 Pesos. It\\'s usually rice with beans and meat, and a lot. If you\\'re on a tight budget or not too hungry, ask for a smaller portion, which is still a lot, and it\\'s only 100 Pesos. If you just want to get 100 Pesos of rice at a restaurant or a public market for example, you can just ask \"Hola, dame cien pesos de arroz, por favor.\"\\n\\nIf you smell the taste of food somewhere in smaller towns or the countryside, people eating together in the garden, you\\'re lucky, as you can easily join (just ask for the way, etc.) without being supposed to pay, that\\'s part of the culture and a reason why I wanted to visit this country. Although, it won\\'t happen too often.\\n\\nIf you arrive at a place in the noon around 12 - be it with your lift in a town, with a person you met at a house, or at a friend\\'s place - people will always invite you for lunch without asking.\\n\\n== Boats out of here ==\\nThere are car ferries three times per week leaving from the Dominican Republic to Puerto Rico. Once in Puerto Rice there are from the state subventioned ferries to Culebra and Vieques, also there are connections to the american virgin islands St. Thomas and St. John.\\nDeparture Santo Domingo Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday at 8 p.m., arrival in Mayaguez (Puerto Rico) 8 a.m. the next day.\\nDeparture Mayaguez (Puerto Rico) Monday, Wednesday and Friday 8.p.m., arrival Santo Domingo 8 a.m. the next day. (www.ferriesdelcaribe.com, (809) 688 4400 for Dom. Rep.)\\n\\nIt\\'s very expensive. 163 USD one-way, 391 USD roundtrip, 172-202 one-way with car. It\\'s worth a try to see if it\\'s hitchable.\\n\\n== [[Boat hitchhiking]] ==\\nIt´s possible to hitchhike sailing boats to get around the Carribean. Two good ports for that are in La Romana and Boca Chica. From May till November nobody´s sailing cause of the winds. You can find the first boat out beginning of November. Recommendable is Boca Chica as it\\'s the bigger port, but if you don´t find any there, La Romana is very close.\\n\\nThe right port in La Romana is, if you go from the Jumbo Supermarket (kind of a cultural centre for this city..) across the river. If you stand on the end of the bridge, you can see the sailing ships already under and left of you, now you just have to find the way down there (it´s a bit longer than it seems).\\n\\nOn the north coast, the sailing hubs are the Puerto Plata area (especially Luperon Harbor) and Samaná (Santa Barbara de Samaná). Luperon/Puerto Plata is where you\\'ll find boats going to/from the Bahamas, and Samaná is a common stop coming to/from Puerto Rico. But the north coast has rougher seas and not many sheltered anchorages in general, so you won\\'t get lots of sailing boats taking leisurely sails from town to town like in some parts of the Caribbean.\\n\\nAsk for \"el puerto/la marina de veleros (=sailing boats)\".\\n\\n== Experiences ==\\n*\\'\\'I tried hitchiking in the northern DR twice during the coronavirus pandemic, and found it quite difficult. The first time, from Las Terrenas to Puerto Plata, no one ever stopped for me except guaguas, which I ended up taking instead after about 30 minutes to an hour waiting in each spot (though I had my pick of less-crowded ones, since another would come by about every 15 minutes). The second time, I was trying to get from the Santiago airport back to Las Terrenas. I understand people not wanting to let me inside their cars during the pandemic (I preferred not to do that either anyway), but I was disappointed at the large number of empty pickup trucks that passed without ever offering me a ride in the back. I did get three short rides from pickups or flatbed trucks, but it seemed like the only way to do it was to catch them when already stopped, and yell \"una bola?\" through their open window. I also got a couple short free rides from motorcycles. But my progress was painfully slow, and I ended up starting again the next day with guauguas. Maybe it was just because people are nervous during the pandemic, or maybe because my face was covered with a mask. Hope it will be better some other time! On the bright side, I didn\\'t see any sign of it being dangerous at all.\\'\\' [[User:Treefrog|Treefrog]] ([[User talk:Treefrog|talk]]) 04:41, 19 January 2021 (CET)Treefrog\\n\\n\\n== Cities ==\\n* [[Santo Domingo]]\\n* [[La Romana]]\\n\\n[[Category:Island]]\\n[[Category:Caribbean]]\\n{{IsIn|Caribbean}}',\n",

As Dortmund is like the Eastern gate to an area of around 5 Million people with a very complicated network of roads and almost without bigger gas stations on the main roads, this is the most convinient hitch-hiking place in the whole region. It is a good idea to come here first if you want to leave another city nearby.\\nAs in the whole region, be prepared that the drivers love to have conversation about football, so you will leave a positive impression if you know the result of the last Borussia Dortmund match.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== North, East, South towards [[Hamburg]], [[Osnabrück]], [[Münster]], [[Cologne]], [[Hannover]], [[Berlin]] ===\\n\\nA really good place is the service area \\'\\'Lichtendorf\\'\\' at the [[A1 (Germany)|A1]], in the south of the town. From city center take subway U47 to Aplerbeck, than take the bus #431 or #438 to \\'\\'Lichtendorf Schule\\'\\', follow the road until the end and turn right into \\'\\'Römerstraße\\'\\'. For going South turn left from Römerweg into a small service road going to the gas station. For going North continue until you can turn left and pass under the bridge and turn left again. The fare is about EUR 2,20.\\n\\nAnother, even better, option is to take the train to Soest (once or twice an hour from the main train station) and go to the stop Dortmund-Soelde. Walk out the stop and take the right exit of the tunnel. After two minutes you will see the bus stop where the bus 431 is going to \"Lichtendorf Schule\" (direction Lichtendorf). Public transport is horrible overpriced in Germany, but at least you don\\'t need to buy seperate tickets for different transportation within the city, so you can use the same ticket for train, metro, trams and busses and change as often as you need. The bus is every 20 minutes, takes 15 minutes to ride and then it takes another 15 minutes walking to get to service station Lichtendorf Sud, from where you can catch a ride North.\\n\\n=== West towards [[Essen]], [[Netherlands|Holland]], [[Belgium]], [[Lille]] ===\\n\\n(51.4992, 7.4499)\\n\\nTake U-bahn 42 or 46 to Kreuzstraße, or walk 30 minutes from the centre. From the station walk through Große Heimstraße until you reach the onramp for the direction Essen. Cars are not going so fast and you\\'re in the shade from the trees.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Soest]], [[Kassel]] ===\\n\\n(51.5085, 7.5445) \\n\\nFrom the center you can take the metro U47 to Aplerbeck to the stop \"Vahleweg\". 50 meters from the bus stop you will see a Shell gas station, from where you can easily catch a ride to the A44 motorway. As there is a lot of traffic to towns nearby, it makes sense to ask for the gas station \"Am Haarstrang\", a fast 30 km ride. From here you can find a lift for long distances.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|Ruhr_Area}}\\n\\n[[Category:E41]]\\n[[Category:E34]]\\n[[Category:Germany]]\\n\\n[[de:Dortmund]]',\n",

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden_Elbe_Valley \\'\\'Dresden Elbe Valley\\'\\'], a former World Heritage Site, is located on its outskirts.\\n\\n== General remarks ==\\nDue to the specific positioning of motorway [[petrol station hitchhiking|petrol stations]] around Dresden, passing this city from the North to the South (and vice versa) could be (but not necessarily) rather difficult.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n=== North towards [[Berlin]], [[Cottbus]] ({{Autobahn|13}}) and East towards [[Poland]] ===\\n\\n\\n==== Option 1 - Hansastraße ====\\n{{Coords|51.0797458759402|13.7395338714123}}\\n{{Coords|51.08410914850553|13.739014863967897}}\\n\\nA great place for direction north and east is \\'\\'Hansastraße\\'\\'. You can either take tram line 13 and get off at \\'\\'Friedensstraße\\'\\' or if you are in \\'\\'Neustadt\\'\\', you can also walk from Alaunpark along \\'\\'Bischofsweg\\'\\' and \\'\\'Fritz-Reuter-Straße\\'\\' in direction west and you will pass the \\'\\'Friedensstraße\\'\\' tram stop as well.\\nWalk down \\'\\'Hansastraße\\'\\' and you will pass 2 petrol stations. Both are good for asking people or to wave a sign. The first is generally better and you may meet some other hitchers. Hitching with thumb only is not recommended as cars are going in all directions.\\n* If you are going to Berlin, just make a sign saying \\'\\'Berlin\\'\\', you will probably get a straight lift from here or at least to Freienhufener where it\\'s very easy to hitch to Berlin from the petrol station/truck stop there. \\n* If you are going to Poland, make a sign saying \\'\\'Bautzen\\'\\'. That\\'s only a short ride, but just before Bautzen there\\'s a great service area on the motorway where it\\'s easy to find a lift to Poland.\\n\\nThe gas stations may not be the best place to hitchhike. There is a good sized entry lane for the shell gas station but the exit has no feeder lane which means you kind of have to choose between the street traffic or just the people at the gas station. The same goes for the, second gas station.\\n\\n==== Option 2 - Hellerberge ====\\n{{Coords|51.0999934090384|13.7359946966171}}\\n{{Coords|51.08746224093905|13.737961292266242}}\\n\\nAnother, good hitchhiking spot is very close to the motorway ramp. From Bahnhof Neustadt take the bus 81 towards \\'\\'Wilschdorf\\'\\' and get off at \\'\\'Hellerberge\\'\\'. If you stand besides the bus stop with a sign \\'\\'Berlin\\'\\', you probably won\\'t wait for long.  It also helps that there is a traffic light just before this so often cars have to come to a complete stop and stare at you for a minute.\\n\\nThere is also a similar and possibly slightly, better bus stop after a traffic light 500 meters up the road from the second gas station in Option 1.  It seemed liked this one has more time with the light being red meaning more drivers had to come to a complete stop before passing the bus stop.\\n\\n==== Option 3 ====\\n\\nIf you don’t have any luck with the above options, one can also simply head to the motorway ramp itself.  There is enough space there for cars to stop and maybe even a truck if you are lucky.\\n\\n\\n==== Option 4 - Bahnhof Dresden-Neustadt ====\\n{{Coords|51.06631985028925|13.7393045425415}}\\n\\nVery often there are hitchhikers, right behind the railway station \\'\\'Dresden-Neustadt\\'\\'. Be aware that this is a common meeting point for car-pools, so if you stop a car there you might be asked to contribute to the cost of fuel, although generally it is very unlikely as anywhere else in Germany.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Görlitz]], [[Wrocław|Wroclaw]] ({{Autobahn|4}}) ===\\n\\n\\n==== Option 1 - On-ramp Hellerberge ====\\n\\nFrom Dresden-Neustadt DB station; take bus number 81 (WILSCHDORF) to the stop \\'Hellerberge\\'. This should not take longer than fifteen minutes. Here you are right at \\'Dresden Hellerau\\' interchange of B170 and A4 / A13 direction Bautzen as well as Görlitz.\\n\\n==== Option 2 - Service station Dresdner Tor ====\\n\\nFrom Dresden take bus 424 or 333 from main station to station Wilsdruff Markt (about 45min ride), go north to junction Nossener/Meißner/Dresdner Straße and turn east into Dresdner Straße. Follow this road for 500m eastwards. You will see a hotel on the right. After this take the left option of the Y-junction, cross the street Umgehungsstraße  (S36) and follow the road K9034 (direction Hühndorf, north-east) for 1km. Right before you hit the freeway turn right and walk along the road parallel to the freeway. After another 500m you reach the service station\\n\\n=== West towards [[Chemnitz]], [[Leipzig]] ({{Autobahn|4}}), ({{Autobahn|14}}) ===\\n\\n\\n====Option 1====\\n\\nGo to the tram stop \\'\\'Cossebauder Straße\\'\\' and walk up the big street (\\'\\'Meißner Landstraße\\'\\'). You can either ask people at the petrol station, stand next to the road with a sign or walk about 1,5km to the A4 ramp (see below).\\n\\n====Option 2====\\n\\nAnother good spot is directly at the motorway A4 ramp. There is quite a good place for the cars to stop; in addition, drivers can notice you in advance when waiting at the traffic lights. To get to this spot, take a bus 94 towards either \\'\\'Cossebaude\\'\\' or \\'\\'Niederwartha\\'\\' and get off at the \\'\\'Zschonergrundstraße\\'\\' stop; you can also get there by local trains RB/RE going to \\'\\'Elsterwerda-Biela\\'\\' or \\'\\'Hoyerswerda\\'\\' (get off at \\'\\'Dresden-Kemnitz\\'\\'). Both for the train and/or the bus you can use one-fare-zone ticket, so it is relatively cheap.\\n\\nComment by Johannes: It is possible to get a ride from here, but the spot is not as ideal as it may sound. Lots of traffic from two sides, but narrow. Drivers from the left side have literally no time to notice you, and those from the right won\\'t be comfortable because they are in a curve and have cars behind them. Still possible (got a ride from here twice) but be patient and I\\'d recommend going without a sign, and when someone stops who is not going your direction have them drop you off at \\'Dresdner Tor\\' service area (6km from that spot)\\n\\n\\n====Option 3====\\n{{Coords|51.10861743987|13.733332824457}}\\n\\nFrom Dresden-Neustadt DB station; take bus number 81 (WILSCHDORF) to the stop \\'Am Olter\\'. This should not take longer than fifteen minutes. Here you are right at, \\'\\'Dresden Hellerau\\'\\' interchange of B170 and A4 / A13  direction Leipzig as well as Chemnitz. You can try to directly hitchhike there or to use \\'Rastanlage Dresdner Tor\\' (10 minutes/12 kilometers from here) as a relais.\\n\\n\\n====Option 4====\\n\\nFor a good service station to ask drivers directly, go to \\'\\'Dresden Hauptbahnhopf\\'\\', buy a ticket to Warthenau (2€ as of July 2013). From Warthenau, take the exit and walk right, descending a semi-gravel road. Turn right under the viaduct, and then turn right again. Here you will see an old German inn called Gasthof Warthenau. Walk to the Gasthof, then cross the street facing the Elbe river: here you will see several bus stops. From the bus stop without a shelter, take bus 331 to \\'\\'Huhndorf\\'\\', only two stops. \\'\\'\\'Note\\'\\'\\': this bus only runs three or four times a day, so figure out what train you should take in order to avoid an hour wait; you can figure this out to go to the information desk at the \\'\\'Hauptbahnhof\\'\\' in Dresden. When you arrive in Huhndorf, walk in the direction the bus just came for approx.\\xa010 metres, then turn right to \\'\\'Am Rasthof\\'\\' (which means \"at the service station\") – yes, that really is the name of the street. Walk down the road to the service station (approx. a 10-minute walk), take the second left, turn right at the house (a cheap hotel) you will find yourself on an excellent service station with restaurants, a giant truck resting area and westbound drivers stopping for petrol. If you want to head to Holland, first try to hitch to Leipzig and then Magdeburg-Hannover, this way you avoid hitching through the [[Ruhr]] area, which is a pain. \\n\\n\\n=== South towards [[Prague]] ({{Autobahn|17}}) ===\\n\\n\\n\\n====Option 1 - Parkplatz Am Nöthnitzgrund====\\n\\nTry to get to the Parkplatz Am Nöthnitzgrund its first  parking lot right after getting on the A17. Nearly everyone leaving Dresden in this direction is going to Pirna and will pass this park place. There is not very much traffic at this stop, but surely everybody is going across the border to the first petrol station in Czech Republic. \\n\\n\\nTo get there use bus 351,252, 360 to stop Bannewitz Nöthnitz and walk Gostritzer street until autoban and than turn right (see Google maps). Walking from centre is 8 km to get there\\n\\n====Option 2====\\n\\nThere are a few places near bus stop \\'\\'Südhöhe\\'\\' (Bus lines 72, 76 & 360) at the overpass intersection of Bergstraße, Südhöhe, Kohlenstaße. <br>\\nA. the onramp to Bergstraße (Highway 170) going south towards A17 and Prag. You can get a driver while they are stopped at the light waiting to take a right onto the highway. See other options for next steps as you are unlikely to get a long distance ride from here. <br> {I tried this option for 1h and didn\\'t work at all. Cars haven\\'t place to stop and usually they have other cars behind so it\\'s really hard to find one that would wait at the green traffic light until you get in the car... march 2017}\\n\\nB. There is a petrol station (\"Aral\") but it is located on the opposite side of the road. It\\'s the last petrol station before the motorway though. {found a car after 1h, really luckily, almost all cars go in the opposite direction... march 2017} <br>\\n\\n\\n====Option 3====\\n\\nTry to stop cars on various bus stops or near traffic lights on \\'\\'Bergstraße\\'\\' between city center and \\'\\'Südhöhe\\'\\'. However, it is difficult for the drivers to stop on this road and taking a bus to \\'\\'Südhöhe\\'\\' is recommended. Haltestelle \\'\\'Mommsenstraße\\'\\' is probably the best as you can easily stand close to the bridge and ask people at the traffic light. It is not advisable to walk along highway 170 past Südhöhe.\\n\\n\\n====Option 4====\\n{{Coords|51.0070042924658|13.7294983863831}}\\n\\nB170, A17 / E55 autobahn interchange. There is a traffic light at entry ramp to A17 east towards Prag with a blue sign, a wide shoulder, and just after the corner to the entry ramp is a small slab of asphalt were drivers can stop. Try to get a ride to the next rest stop, about 5 minutes away driving. <br>\\nTo get here: <br>\\n* Get a ride to the A17 west onramp from one of the other options. They will be dropping you off on the side of the highway so be careful.\\n* Take bus 360 from Dresden main station towards A17 (direction \\'\\'Dippoldiswalde\\'\\'). Press the stop button directly after you pass the onramp to A17 towards Prague. The bus will stop 200m later so walk back to the onramp. (bus stop \"Nöthnitz, Bannewitz\") <br>\\n\\n\\n====Option 5====\\n\\nHaving tried a few of the above options, we headed to the Technical University (\\'Technische Universtät\\') and got a ride in about 20 minutes. It\\'s along the highway to Prague and I figured it might have a younger population driving past (being based around a uni).  \\n\\nFrom Haubtbahnhof, take the 66 bus (heading south) to stop \\'Technische Universtät.\\' This will place you along the 170 highway that passes North-South through Dresden and later connects with the A17 highway towards Prague. Try hitching a ride from the bus stop. It allows plenty of space for cars to stop, and the buses come every 20 mins - so they shouldn\\'t be too much of an issue for stopping cars. Make yourself a clear and legible sign so passing drivers can see where you want to go.\\n\\nWe (two hitchhikers) waited at the universitat (option 5) for more than 2 hours without getting any ride. The spot is good but people were not driving outside of the city so not so good. Then we walked (20 min) to the petrol station (option 1B) and there we get a ride with the first car to the first rest area when you are on the highway. It was a small rest area and not many car were stopping there and more than the half were driving to Pirna or Dresden. We waited there 2 more hours before getting a ride.\\n\\n\\n=== South by train, hitchhiking in Czech Republic ([[Děčín]], [[Ústí nad Labem]]) ===\\n\\nIf you got some time and money, and prefer seeing some landscape of the Elbe/Labe valley as well as of the Saxonian and Bohemian \"Switzerland\" mountains, you can take the train \\'\\'\\'S1\\'\\'\\' from Dresden (from main station, Dresden-Neustadt and others; direction \\'\\'\\'Schöna\\'\\'\\') to the Czech border. The ticket is 17 Euro (as of 2015 october) - get it at the ticket machines and validate it before entering the train!\\n\\nYou can either leave the train at \\'\\'\\'Schmilka-Hirschmühle\\'\\'\\' (the ferry there is included in the ticket price) or at \\'\\'\\'Schöna\\'\\'\\' (and pay the ferry extra). After crossing the river by ferry, walk over the border and through \\'\\'\\'Hřensko\\'\\'\\'. There is a bus stop at the end of the town and a large space behind it. If there are too many cars parked, hitch at the bus stop directly.\\n\\nThere is not much traffic, so prepare to wait a while. Everybody goes to [[Děčín]] from here. If you\\'re lucky, you will find a direct hike to [[Ústí nad Labem]].\\n\\nAs well the train ride as the road from Hřensko have really nice nature which is best experienced in good weather.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking in ==\\nIf you driver is passing Dresden in east-west direction, it\\'s a good idea to have him drop you at the exit \\'\\'Dresden-Neustadt\\'\\'. It\\'s very easy for then  driver to get back onto the motorway and there\\'s a tram station from where you can get into the city centre easily.\\n\\n== Passing through Dresden (North->South or South->North) ==\\nIf you are coming from the North (e.g. Berlin, A13 or A4 from the East) and you want to continue to the South (e.g. Prague) you might have some troubles regarding the location of where you can be dropped off for further successful hitchhiking in case when your driver is not going further your way.\\n\\nThe problem is that the motorway splits just before the motorway petrol station called Dresdner Tor (Aral), so if you are dropped at the petrol station, you will get only those drivers who go the other way (to the West).\\n\\nThen, you have several ways to get further (in any of these ways you will have similar problems and solutions):\\n* you might want to get dropped off way before Dresden, at the gasstation Freienhufener Eck West, approximately 60 kilometers before getting into the city;\\n* get a ride going west onto A4 at Dresden, so that you can be dropped off at Dresdner-Tor Nord. Then walk west for about 800 meters to a local road, walk through the tunnel and walk back east at the other side of the motorway for 800 meters to get back on Dresdner-Tor Sud.\\n* you find a nice driver willing to do a loop for you meaning that he must drive off the motorway after that \"Aral\" petrol station, make a U-turn, take the motorway in the opposite direction and drop you off at the petrol station, and only then he can either enter Dresden or make another U-turn if he is heading West;\\n\\n== Public transport ==\\nThe public transport in Dresden consists of buses, trams and regional S-Bahn trains. All of them can be used with the same ticket given it is valid for your zone. \\n\\n* You can validate your ticket in both trams and buses. The machines \"beeps\" when you do so. Tickets can not be validated in the S-Bahn, you have to do that on the platform or your ticket might be considered invalid.\\n* Ticket machines on tram stops give you unstamped (unvalidated) tickets which you validate inside the tram at any time later. Bus drivers sell stamped (validated) tickets.\\n* Inside most of dresden DVB AG trams there is a ticket machine that gives you an already stamped (validated) ticket. You cannot  rely on the phrase: \"I am already hanging around the machine to buy a ticket the very next moment\" when inspectors are showing up around you within seconds. The given argument will definitely not be helpful! You do not hold a valid DVB AG transportation document in yours hands!\\n* People carrying an adult monthly, yearly or job ticket can take somebody along on Saturday, Sunday and public holidays for free. This is possible from the day before (e.g. Friday for weekends) 18:00 until the day after (e.g. Monday for weekends) 06:00. Just ask around at the stops. Unfortunately students cannot take you.\\n\\n=== Blackriding (Freeloading, Freeriding) ===\\n\\n[\\'\\'The information below does not apply to the S-Bahn city train. See [[Deutsche Bahn]] instead\\'\\']\\n\\n* If you fail to show your ticket to an inspector you will most likely get a fine of 40 EUR which needs to be paid by bank transfer within about 10 days. Rumors are that even if you are a foreigner but living within the European Union an announcement to pay will be send even to your country.\\n* Ticket inspectors in Dresden (DVB AG) are dressed in civil clothes.\\n* They are usually neither very friendly to foreigners nor able to speak English very well. Make sure to have a valid(!) ticket.\\n* Ticket inspectors are difficult but possible to spot: They do \\'\\'\\'not\\'\\'\\' look like students which mostly carry a laptop case and/or wear a white or light blue shirt with a collar. They do \\'\\'\\'not\\'\\'\\' look like businessmen which would wear suit and tie. The are mostly \\'\\'\\'not\\'\\'\\' older than 50 to 55 years. They are mostly \\'\\'\\'not\\'\\'\\' younger than 20 years. They do \\'\\'\\'not\\'\\'\\' carry any (large) case, (heavy or completely filled) backpack or plastic (shopping) bag with them. They do \\'\\'\\'not\\'\\'\\' use mp3 player or walkmen with any sort of earphones. They mostly appear in smaller groups of two or three men in an average dress (sloppy T-shirt or pullover, jeans, a fisherman vest, cheaper non-brand shoes). They are mostly standing (or sitting) together but are \\'\\'\\'not\\'\\'\\' talking (or arguing) to/at each other in public.\\n* Ticket inspectors mostly carry a very small waist backpack or normal (but almost empty) backpack underneath a vest/shirt where their DVB AG computer devices or official papers are in.  \\n* Ticket inspections are \\'\\'\\'not\\'\\'\\' conducted (as in some other European cities) \\'\\'\\'on\\'\\'\\' bus or tram platforms or \\'\\'\\'on\\'\\'\\' open bus or tram doors but \\'\\'\\'only\\'\\'\\' when vehicles are moving between two stops.\\n* After 20:00 you need to get into the bus through the first door where the driver sits. Drivers are supposed to check tickets but usually do not give them a closer look. You might be lucky when you quickly show an older (and now invalid) DVB AG ticket.\\n* At night, ticket inspectors in trams are accompanied by security personnel.\\n* Most DVB AG ticket inspections are conducted from around 09:00 to around 13:00.\\n\\n== Sleeping ==\\n\\nIn summer you can sleep at the river. The police are never looking for sleeping people or anything. A good place is [http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=51.06293&lon=13.783811&zoom=18&layers=M this].

It is strictly forbidden and Großer Garten is patroulled by its own security personnel while Alaunpark could be checked by the police multiple times during the night.\\n\\n== Souvenirs ==\\n\\nYou can buy expensive stuff at the touristic shops but every Saturday there is a second hand market until 14:00 @ [http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=51.057502&lon=13.757617&zoom=18&layers=M here] where people sell ancient things - e.g. from the time of the socialism - very cheap.\\nMoreover you can bring or get clothes for free at the free shop [http://www.openstreetmap.org/index.html?mlat=51.068065&mlon=13.75335&zoom=16# here].

Its population is 1 million inhabitants. Car licence plates from Dublin have the letter D in them.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking In==\\nHitchhiking out of Dublin is easy enough, however, you have to be outside the city and outside suburban areas. In some areas you can walk to the outskirts/countryside, but mainly you'll have to take a bus (especially if you're heading west).\\n\\nIf you arrived in Dublin or Dún Laoghaire ports by ferry, you should try to hitch a ride at the exit of the ferry port, as there are a lot of cars going to all parts of the country.\\n\\nBe sure to have a large card with the town name you want to go to spelt correctly and shown to oncoming drivers, when at a port or a national road.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Dundalk]], [[Belfast]] ===\\nSince there is a new road to Belfast, there is no point in going to the Dublin Airport Roundabout. Besides that it's very dangerous to stand along the motorway.\\nRather take the bus 33 at the ''Irish life Mall'' to the roundabout just outside '''Swords''' and ask the driver if he could drop you off before the traffic lights. There is enough space for a car to stop and you can thumb quite safely.\\n\\nIf you can get to the Applegreen service station before the M1 business park (53.537758,-6.213606) way after Swords. From there, all the cars headed up north\\n\\n=== Northwest towards [[Navan]], [[Cavan]] ===\\nGo to Blanchardstown Roundabout or Castleknock Roundabout. Take the following buses: 38, 38A, 38B, 38C, 39, 39A, 70, 76A, 236, 237, 238, 239, 270. This is linked to the N2.\\n\\n=== West towards [[Mullingar]], [[Athlone]], [[Galway]] ===\\nLast traffic lights before M50 bypass (Junction 7). You can get here by buses 25, 66, 67 from Pearse Str.\\n\\nIn the same road, 500m direction Dublin, you'll find a petrol station. Perfect for this direction, you can ask people directly. It's maybe the best option for hitchhiking in this direction. You can stop at the bus stop No. 2201 (Lucan Road, Palmerstown Drive), to get there. \\n\\nGet a train from ''Connolly'' station to Maynooth. Ticket costs around 3 Euro. From here it is a 2 km walk towards a M4 motorway exit to the West of Ireland. This should all take 60 minutes.\\n\\nHeuston Station: Go out the side door of the station (to your left if you're standing facing the platforms) and across the road. This is the N4, which leads directly onto the M4 going west.\\n\\n=== Southwest towards [[Naas]], [[Portlaoise]], [[Limerick]], [[Cork]] ===\\nGo to the ''Rathcoole'' petrol station on the West side of Dublin city. This can be reached by the number 69 bus from Dublin City Centre i.e. ''Aston Quay'' for around 3,30 Euro. It takes about one hour to reach this excellent spot. From the An Poitin Stil Bar bus stop, you walk up the motorway (the path can be found via the bar car park) for 5 minutes until you reach a petrol station on the left hand side. Many drivers going towards Cork and Limerick here. There is a toll booth after Portlaoise (Irish town 100 km away). The road divides in two in the direction of Cork and Limerick just after this facility. You can always ask somebody to drop you at the booth if they are not going the whole way (Cork bound car, but you want to go to Limerick, etc.).\\n\\nThis is a great spot, if your driver isn't going far aim for junction 14 service station near Monasterevin. Cars for Limerick might offer to bring you to the toll gate at Portlaoise but from here you could easily hold out for a direct lift to Cork.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Wicklow]], [[Enniscorthy]], [[Wexford]], [[Rosslare]] ===\\nGo to the Bray Roundabout near the petrol station. Take the Dart train to ''Bray'' station or the following buses: 145, 184, 185, 45, 45A, 84. This is linked to the M11.\\nOtherwise, take the R761 and hitch-hike at the bus stops near Southern Cross Road in Bray, ask to go to Greystones, Wicklow or Arklow, and hitch-hike again from those locations.\\n\\n=== North northwest towards [[Ashbourne]], [[Ardee]] ===\\nGo to Finglas village and walk down the motorway exit (sign post Derry). Stand on the side of the road with sign and/or thumb. Take the following buses: 17A, 40, 40A, 40 C, 40D, 83, 104. This is linked to the N2.\\n\\n=== South southwest towards [[Blessington]], [[Tullow]] ===\\nGet the Luas red line tram to the last stop ''Tallaght''. The best place to hitch is at the traffic lights just before the Square Shopping Centre exit at ''Tallaght Pass''. This leads on to the N81.\\n\\n=== South-West from Dublin airport ===\\nIf you want to travel quickly from Dublin airport towards Cork or Limerick, you should do the following. Take the 'Dublin Coach' service from the bus depot towards Portlaoise (ticket costs 5 euro and trip takes 30 minutes). Ask the driver nicely to drop you off at the bus stop on the motorway near the An Poitin Stil Bar. The bus driver should help you, especially if you keep your bags on you and not in the side compartment of the coach. When you get off the bus, you walk up the motorway (the path can be found via the bar car park) for 5 minutes until you reach a petrol station on the left hand side. There is a toll booth after Port Laoise (Irish town 100 km away). The road divides in two in the direction of Cork and Limerick just after this facility. You can always ask somebody to drop you at the booth if they are not going the whole way (Cork bound car, but you want to go to Limerick, etc.).\\n\\n==To Do==\\nThe majority of museums in Dublin are entirely free and definitely worth going to. Busking around the hot tourist spots requires a permit. No one should bother you on one of the small streets or busy areas outside of Temple Bar.\\n\\n== Food ==\\nThere are several feedings throughout the week. SAFE is on Grafton Street with food and clothes Monday and Friday nights.\\n\\nFruit and veg stalls just off Parnell St have many skips full of food, go during the day and browse like a shopper.\\n\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n[[Category:Ireland]]\\n[[Category:E20]]\\n[[Category:E1]]\",\n",

The old town is a UNESCO world heritage site and nearly over run by tourists in the summer months, it is extremly difficult to CS in this place.\\n\\nThere is a [[hitchhiking a boat|ferry]] to [[Bari]], [[Italy]] departing in Dubrovnik. The town is close to the border to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Montenegro]].\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== North towards [[Neum]], [[Mostar]], [[Split]] and [[Zagreb]] {{E|65}} ===\\nHitchhiking north out of Dubrovnik - does require some patience, all the rest areas seem to be located on the coast, making it difficult to find a good area. \\n\\nOption 1: The spot below works although you might have to wait for a while. Go the the main bus station, in the north. Cross the road and keep walking north and look for steps leading up the hill side. \\'\\'\\'If find yourself under the bridge, you have gone too far.\\'\\'\\' If you follow the path, it will lead you all the way up to the {{E|65}}. Then, cross the bridge and continue across to the other side, where you will find a rather small pull in spot. Make sure you stay behind the barrier and make yourself as visible as possible, because there is not a lot of space for stopping and drivers can\\'t see it from far away. \\n\\nOption 2: Easier to get there. There are bus stops on the \\'\\'Jadranska Cesta\\'\\' Street. A good one to hitch is the one opposite to the \\'\\'Lodpudska Ulica\\'\\'. Hitch with a HUGE sign \"Ploče\". You can take bus #3 from the city centre to get there, but the place is not as good as the bridge described above.\\n\\n* I don\\'t want to discourage anyone, but, I was hitchhiking from Dubrovnik to Ploče, to anywhere out of Dubrovnik towards the north-west for about 2 hours and nothing. What I noticed were cars full of people, mostly families going back home from vacation. It was in august. Maybe if it\\'s not the season, it will be less traffic but more useful one. My friend was HH two times from Dubrovnik to Ploče. Once he was waiting one and a half hour til he got a ride, second time 2 hours without any success. Another option is a bus, but you have to walk down from HH spot to the bus station near the sea for about 20 minutes. Bus costs 10 Euro. I stuck there at night, it was 20:00 so, at that time, bus sounded as a good option. (by [[User:NixyJungle|NixyJungle]])\\n\\n* Tried this spot in August 2015 and waited approximately 1h 20m for a ride to the Bosnian border near Neum. It\\'s a relatively good spot because of the bridge, which makes it visible but most cars are full during summer time. (by [[User:Uncle sam01|uncle_sam01]])\\n\\n* I hitchhiked from the bridge in March 2017. It was still low season so there aren\\'t as many full cars. But there is still quite a bit of traffic. I found a ride all the way to Mostar in about 30 minutes. The guys offered to take me all the way to Sarajevo! (by [[User:Henridv|Henridv]])\\n\\n* July 2017 - we went to the bus station described in Option 2 from where we walked through the bridge (there is a bit of road with no pavement, don\\'t worry, its normal here to walk along the road). On the other side of the bridge, described place looks much better than described in Option 1. There is a lot of space to stop and you are visible. I felt confused by what I found on Hitchwiki, as it was described as a mediocre spot, where in real it looked great. Got a 15 km ride in 20 minutes and another one all the way to Split in another 20 minutes.\\n\\n* Sept 2018 - [[user:jamesvagabond|jamesvagabond]] waited at the pullout just past the bridge for about 15 mins and got a ride well into Bosnia. The spot seems to have been improved, quite a bit of space. The bridge also has a sidewalk.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Montenegro]] {{E|65}} 8 ===\\n[[File:DSCI0111.JPG|left|thumb|[[User:Quarim|Quarim]]\\'s backpack with a [[Montenegro]] [[signs|sign]] in front of the historic old town of Dubrovnik]]\\nHitchhiking out of Dubrovnik - which is the last major town in the south of Croatia - does not seem that difficult, although it might require quite some luck. Just climb up to the coastline road and hitchhike on the E65. A couple of kilometres after the city, there is a scenic view with a café and a large parking space, large enough to stop a truck. IMPORTANT! If you are already on the part of E65 close to the old town, \\'\\'\\'don\\'t\\'\\'\\' move any further east! For the next 2.5 km there is not much space to walk - not to mention to stop for the cars because of crash barriers, and you will have to walk it all. Its a very scenic - but also not very safe walk, in case you want to give it a try.\\n\\nMost drivers, though, are heading mainly towards either [[hitchhiking a plane|airport]] or the small town of [[Gruda]]. It is still about 10 km from there to the [[Montenegro-Croatian border crossing]] between [[Herceg Novi|Herceg-Novi]] (Montenegro) near Gruda (Croatia). Since the traffic is pretty low on that road - especially in the late afternoon/evening - you will need some luck to find someone crossing the border and willing to take you. Most probably you will be picked up by some tourists.\\n\\n*August 2015: We weren\\'t able to stop a car for 3 hours. We were heading to Montenegro, but locals discouraged us from this telling us that most of traffic goes to the airport or [[Gruda]]. However, we saw many cars from Montenegro passing. During the RedBull hitchhiking competition which received quite good media coverage, locals were stopping very often but now it was pure misery.\\n\\n\\n*August 2016:\\nYou can take Bus 1a or 1b from Pile Gate(Old Town) to central Bus Station near cruise ship port for 15 Kune, 12 if you buy it at kiosk. From there you can take bus 10 towards Cavtat and get off at Kitzovica 20 km outside of town which might help you avoid the Dubrovnik tourists who won\\'t pick you up...( the name is either Kitzovica or very similar to that, ask your bus driver to tell you when you\\'re there). You can also take this bus simply to the top of the hill above old town and get off there if you don\\'t feel like climbing the hill with your stuff. The #10 bus is only 25 Kune to Kitzovica and progressively less if you don\\'t go that far.  From the Kitzovica stop I walked 20m and hitched from right in front of bus stop so cars could pull into bus space and I got a ride within literally 5 seconds all the way to Bar.\\n\\n*Sept. 2019:\\nWith bus #10, the place you\\'re looking for is called Zvekovica, and it\\'s 22kn for a ticket one-way. On a Monday mid-morning the ride took almost 50mins, then standing just before the bus stop I got a ride within 5 mins to Kotor.\\n\\n== From Airport to Dubrovnik ==\\nJust ask someone in front of the airport to go with them. If you just landed in Dubrovnik, there is usually someone with a car, waiting for their friends and families from the same flight as yours, so it shouldn\\'t be a problem.\\n\\n== Sleeping ==\\n[[File:IMG_0661.jpg|left|thumb|[[User:axler8|axler8]]\\'s backpack at his scenic stealth camping spot, just before the bridge at the north part of Dubrovnik]]\\n\\n=== Stealth Camping ===\\nAlong the coastline road there are plenty of places where you can put up a sleeping bag, though few places large enough for a tent. However, be very careful and use a torch, as there are sudden drops in many places and walking here without light is dangerous.\\n\\nFrom city centre - or pile (city centre bus hub) take a main street called Branitelja Dubrovnika for about 1 km, on your left side you will see green rail and few benches down in the small park. There is one stairs going down. Go down there and turn to right, at the end of this small park there is another hidden stairs going down. Go there and you will find really nice spot called Club Boninovo. It\\'s place what local made for their relax. During season it could be crowded during day, but during night it should be safe. There is grill for use and stairs down to water. Also you can jump from rock to the sea. Enjoy! May, 2015. [[User:Moody93|Moody]]\\n\\n*This is a beautiful spot. Favourite part about my stay was this spot. Be warned, the walk from the spot to the hitchhiking spot is primarily stairs, so plan accordingly if you are trying to get out early. \\n*Great spot indeed, in the weekend however students were here \\'till 1 or 2 am, so prepare for the possible option that sleeping is not going to happen before early hours. June 2016\\n*one of the best sleeping spot I had. It might be better to arrive a bit before night because of the stairs. We met 2 different groups of hitchhikers the same night. Locals arrived from 8am. \\n\\nAnother option is to go to the peninsula Babin Kuk, which is an area of small forests, beaches and a (quite expensive) camping. It\\'s possible to find a wild camping spot here, and it\\'s a half-hour walk (1 hour from old town) or 5 minute bus ride from Dubrovnik.\\n\\n*\\'\\'Babin Kuk was recommended as a reasonable wild camping area by a local. We ended up sleeping in our sleeping bags in a more secluded part of a commercial tourist centre there (it felt safe), though you can also find normal camping spots near the beach. June 2014. Nick\\'\\'\\n\\n=== Hostel ===\\nSleeping in a Hostel in Dubrovnik is an option which costs around EUR 13 per night. You can be unlucky in the summer months where it might be booked out if you appear without reservation.

Because Dubrovnik is loved by tourists, couchsurfers from this town are spammed by requests and will probably not answer.\\n\\n=== Port of Dubrovnik ===\\n\\n500 metres from the main bus station in the direction of the old town is the \"port of Dubrovnik\", which is open 24 hours a day. In summer, the place may be a bit noisy and inconvenient to get some sleep, however, in other times of the year it would generally provide a good night\\'s sleep especially if it\\'s cold or raining. \\n*\"We tried to sleep there but they closed waiting room over night like one hour after ship to Italy left the harbour.

Hitchhiking out will be quite difficult because of the colossal network of motorways in the Ruhr Area. Nevertheless, \\'\\'don\\'t panic\\'\\', we\\'ll give it a try!\\n\\nAs you can see on your map [[Düsseldorf|Dusseldorf]] is just south of this city so you can easily follow instruction for Dusseldorf. You \"have to\" pay ticket for the tram because in a tram (every tram) they have two officers who are standing there and with that ticket (2,20 Euros) yiz can travel one part of journey towards Dusseldorf (or whole journey) and if control came try to play dummy tourist ( I didn\\'t try because in Berlin is very tricky when you are without ticket and both of them are owned by DB). On the other hand if you are without money wait rush hour around 5-6 o\\'clock and get into tram, train. The city is very long, so walking with bag is not very good idea. \\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== North towards [[Münster]], East towards [[Hannover]] ===\\nCurrently the best option seems to be this:\\n* Take a train somehow towards \\'\\'Oberhausen-Sterkrade\\'\\'. From there take the bus #979 to the \\'\\'Heinrich-Heine-Straße\\'\\' in [[Bottrop]]. From there you\\'ll see the motorway, just walk towards it. It\\'s a good spot to hitch away fast towards [[Münster]] or [[Hannover]].\\n__NOTOC__\\n\\n=== West towards [[Venlo]], [[Rotterdam]] and [[Amsterdam]] ===\\nThere are two options: \\n\\n1. Relatively central, between the Ruhrport harbour and the city center, there is a big roundabout in Duisburg Kaßlerfeld, which leads right onto the highway. Traffic is high, especially during rushhour and cars go slow through the roundabout with possibilities to stop. Use a sign with \\'\\'Venlo\\'\\' or \\'\\'A40\\'\\'. \\n\\n2. More towards the West of the city, there is a good onramp in \\'\\'Duisburg-Esseberg\\'\\' . \\nTo get there, take the bus 928 towards \\'\\'WInkelhausen Bruchstraße\\'\\' and drop off at \\'\\'Duisburg Esseberg Brücke\\'\\'. The bus quickly goes onto the highway and to cross the Rhine and leaves it exactly at the on/offramp you want to get on. After getting off the bus, walk back under the bridge to the onramp and position yourself just before the blue highway sign. \\n\\nOn a general note: Hitchhiking is difficult, as many people do not go very far. Therefore, anything that gets you onto the highway and to a service/rest stop is usually a good shot.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Cologne]], [[Frankfurt]] and [[Nuremberg]] ===\\n\\nThe best way to get out of Duisburg and onto the A3 which leads you to the south, right down to Bavaria and even to Austria, is to take the train at the main station towards \\'\\'Duisburg-Entenfang\\'\\' and drop out at \\'\\'Duisburg-Wedau\\'\\'\\n* From there it is a 5 minutes walk to the motorway access, just get out of the train station and walk down to the left, then keep to the right at the crossing.\\n* It is adviceable to prepare a sign saying in which direction you want to go although there is actually just one possibilty for you (southwards). People are willing to take you onto the motorway, to the next service station or even further. Approx. waiting time: 15-30 minutes.\\n* Passing [[Cologne]] could possibly get quite difficult but once you\\'ve done it, you are able to cross Germany in just 1 day and also easily switch motorways at some points on the road.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n[[Category:Germany]]\\n[[Category:North Rhine-Westphalia]]\\n[[Category:E35]]\\n\\n[[de:Duisburg]]',\n",

Where Riverside Ave and Kingsway W meet in the west of the city you will find a roundabout where all the westbound traffic passes. 1km beyond this there is a petrol station where lifts can be found. ([http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=56.46396,-3.065636&spn=0.005346,0.021973&t=k&z=16 location on map]) If you are in the city center and don't fancy to walk to that point, it is possible to start off from the riverside next to a big tesco there are a few small roundabout followed by layby. not perfect, but it does work!\\n\\n=== South towards [[St. Andrews]], [[Edinburgh]] ===\\nTo get south from Dundee you have to cross the bridge. There are 2 options because you have 2 ways to enter the bridge. One is the junction on the between 'S Marketgait' and 'Riverside Drive'. The other possibility is to go to the western side of the bridge, where 'E Marketgait' and 'E Dock Street' cross. There you have traffic lights and even a petrol station to ask the people directly. ([http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=56.460641,-2.970171&spn=0.010694,0.043945&z=15 location on map])\\nIf you do cross the bridge, it will still be tricky to get a ride, as the roundabout at the south end of it is a fast and awkward place to pull over. If you have no luck here, you might consider walking south to the next roundabout, just over 1 mile (don't walk on the motorway; there are residential roads that run parallel to it). You'll see a Shell petrol station, after which there is a roundabout where traffic for St Andrews and Edinburgh splits. The traffic is much slower here so a lift should be easy to find. \\n\\n=== North towards [[Aberdeen]] ===\\nStart on the A90, on the north of the Kingsway. Halfway between the juction between the Kingsway and the A90 and the junction between the A90 and Claverhouse Drive, there is a layby on the northbound cardige way. The traffic wont be moving too fast and the layby works great for easy lifts north. \\n\\n=== East towards [[Stonehaven]] ===\\nTo ride up the east coast, you want to catch a ride on the A92. This is hard from within the city as there is alot of local traffic and apropriate stopping points within the city. In Broughty Ferry, a Subbarb of Dundee, there is a roundabout on the A92 which lends itself to hitching, when traffic will be slowing down on the aprocach to a roundabout. It is best accessed by a bus from the city center as it is an hour and half walk. \\n\\n\\n== Public Transport ==\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n__NOTOC__\\n{{IsIn|Scotland}}\\n\\n[[Category:Scotland]]\\n[[Category:United Kingdom]]\",\n",

       " 'Dunkerque': {'text': '{{Hitchhiking Zine nomination}}\\n{{Infobox Location\\n|country = France\\n|map = <map lat=\\'51.035\\' lng=\\'2.377\\' zoom=\\'11\\' view=\\'0\\' />\\n|pop = 87,353\\n|state = Hauts-de-France\\n|motorways = {{Afr|16}} {{Afr|25}}\\n}}\\n\\'\\'\\'Dunkerque\\'\\'\\' (English: \\'\\'\\'Dunkirk\\'\\'\\', Dutch: \\'\\'\\'Duinkerke\\'\\'\\', German: \\'\\'\\'Dünkirchen\\'\\'\\') is a major port town at the Channel with [[hitchhiking a boat|ferries]] across the [[English channel]] to [[Dover]] (\\'\\'norfolklines\\'\\' – crossings every 2 hours). The ferries are free for hitchhikers, if you find someone to give you a lift onto the ferry.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== West to [[Calais]], South to [[Lille]] ===\\nThere is a roundabout right next to \\'\\'Polyclinic Villette\\'\\' on \\'\\'Avenue du Stade\\'\\'. Cars can park there quite easily, also on the parking spot right next to it. McDo is close to this position, too, for asking people. Furthermore there is a traffic light a little bit ahead towards the river, which also marks the end of possible spots to stand with a sign or the thumb since there is no place to stop a car and the traffic is getting too fast.\\nSee the [[English channel]] page for more information about options for crossing the channel. \\n\\n=== East towards [[Belgium]] ===\\nIt also must be possible in the above mentioned spot to get lifts towards [[Belgium]]. The first petrol station in Belgium is \\'\\'\\'Mannekensvere\\'\\'\\' just after exit 3, [[Nieupoort]], and a further one is at [[Jabbeke]], shortly before [[Bruges|Brugge]].\\n\\n[[User:Jeensg|Jeensg]] also experienced it to be worthwhile getting on the motorway and being dropped off just at the first onramp after Belgian border (Adinkerke), where he got a ride to [[Brussels]] after 2 minutes.\\n\\n=== To [[England]] ===\\nIt is less busy and more laid-back/friendly than the [[Calais]]-Dover route. Both the Calais-Dover boats and the Dunkerque-Dover boats do not charge for extra passengers in vehicles. While [[Calais]]-Dover ferries allow foot passengers (cost about £15/20Euros), it is not possible from Dunkerque, so you have no other choice than to get a lift.\\n\\nSince mid October[2018] busses around Dunkerque are free, so from Dunkerque city centre, it is possible to take a free bus in the direction of Loon-Plage. Close to the ferry is a hotel parking lot at the roundabout, which is a good place to be dropped off. The best way to catch a ride from there is walking a little bit in the direction of the ferry. Be warned the signs \\'car ferry\\' on the roundabout point in the \\'wrong\\' direction here, not many cars take this exit because it is a detour towards the ferry. It is faster to take the first exit (when coming from Dunkerque direction). To catch all cars & vans who will cross the Channel walk 10 min to the next roundabout.\\n\\nCrossing takes about 1h50 and on the \\'\\'Norfolkline\\'\\' ships there provide free wireless internet access.\\n\\n==== How to get to the port ====\\nFerries leave from Port Ouest.\\n\\nTo get there from Dunkerque, take a bus \\'\\'\\'A\\'\\'\\' (i.e. from the city center/railway station), going towards Loon Plage (various terminus possible). Get off at \\'\\'Maison Blanche\\'\\' (about 12km, 30min), walk up to the big roundabout. From there you have 3km left - I recommend walking, but if you have time, you can always try to hitch. \\n\\nIf on the A16 motorway (Calais <-> Dunkerque) take the Exit 24.\\n\\n==== Trucks ====\\nBefore the port there is big parking place for trucks and lorries (about 1km square). It is very easy to get a ride over there. Many vehicles on Polish, Romanian, Turkish and Slovak numbers. But you can find some English, Irish or German ones as well.\\n\\n==== Cars ====\\nA bit further, there is a car park, just in front of a ticket office. You can probably try to get a lift asking drivers there. Usually you have to explain that they pay for car and not for amount of people, but correct number of passengers must be on their ticket. Changing booking is free of charge and takes less than a minute. Always have your documents ready to show to drivers, so they know you are not an illegal immigrant.\\n\\n==== Once on the ferry ====\\nOnce you are on the ferry, it is an excellent idea to ask around for a lift. It is far easier to do this, than to hitchhike when you land. The best tactic is to approach individuals directly and say something like \"Excuse me, sorry to bother you. I am trying to hitchhike to [\\'\\'destination\\'\\']. I don\\'t suppose you could give me a lift in that direction?\" Most people on the boat will speak English. Do not try to get a lift by standing at the stairs from the car deck with a sign. It does not work well.\\n\\n==== Important for Non-EU Nationals (including US citizens) ====\\nThere are UK passport controls in Dunkerque and if you do not have the proper papers, you may encounter a lot of hassle, including being denied entry. Worse, the friendly driver who gave you a ride might also face delays. \\n\\nUpon arrival in Dover, UK customs also have a tendency to check far more cars than any other EU country, the UK is \\'\\'\\'not\\'\\'\\' part of the [[Schengen Agreement]], so you might consider leaving the ferry as a foot-passenger to save your driver a potentially substantial delay! (Not possible if you arrived using \\'\\'Norfolklines\\'\\')\\n\\nIf you look respectable, are from a wealthy country, [[United States of America|USA]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], to name a few, you are unlikely to have any problems entering the UK, even as a hitchhiker. Show a passport from [[Somalia]], [[Pakistan]] or [[Iran]], to name a few that are somewhat less respectable in the eyes of the UK government, expect lots of hassle, including being denied entry. \\n\\nIf you think you will fall in the latter category, you should consider going on to [[Calais]], \\'\\'Norfolkline\\'\\', which sails from Dunkerque does not take foot-passengers, and spend the money to buy a foot-passenger (return) ticket yourself to avoid causing trouble for your driver, although that does not in any way reduce the risk that you\\'re denied entry either at UK immigration in France or upon arrival in Dover. \\n\\nAs with any border crossing, it helps if you look respectable, \\'\\'\\'even\\'\\'\\' if you come from the EU or respectable countries, and have money (or better, a credit card) to support yourself.\\n\\n[[Calais]] is an alternative to cross the Channel. Sailings from there are far more frequent and all shipping companies take foot-passengers, although at least some (\\'\\'\\'P&O\\'\\'\\') no longer do so on every sailing or in the middle of the night!\\n{{IsIn|Nord-Pas de Calais}}\\n\\n[[Category:France]]\\n[[Category:Nord-Pas de Calais]]\\n[[Category:E42]]\\n[[Category:Ferries]]\\n\\n[[fr:Dunkerque]]',\n",

However it is possible, of course. \\n\\n===From North===\\nBest possibility is at the end of  {{Ade|52}} at the big \"ARAG\" building. Several options for public transport. Minus is that this is only for drivers going directly to Düsseldorf.\\nIf your driver just wants to pass Düsseldorf by the  {{Ade|44}} in direction to [[Mönchengladbach]], [[Krefeld]] or the Netherlands tell him to drop you off at the Düsseldorf Iternational Airport. There is a lot of public transport like Busses, S-Bahn an RegionalExpress towards the city. Beside that you could try to hitchhike from the parking spots at the \"Departure\". Lots of slow cars with empty trunks and backseats. \\n\\n===From East===\\nIf you are on the {{Ade|46}} coming from Wuppertal the best opportunity is the Exit \"Düsseldorf -Wersten\". There is public transport and within minutes you are at the main station or in the city centre. Plus your driver can get back on the highway pretty easy and fast. \\n\\n===From South===\\nBest opportunities on the {{Ade|3}}. Last option is the service station called \"Ohligser Heide\". You have to get a lift to {{Ade|46}} eastwards and then same as above: Exit \"Düsseldorf-Wersten\". \\n\\n===From West===\\nIf your driver wants to Neuss you could take it and take the public transport to Düsseldorf. Just make sure he will drop you off near the main station. \\n\\nIf your driver want to pass in direction to [[Wuppertal]], [[Dortmund]], or even [[Frankfurt am Main]] they might take the {{Ade|46}} and than is is the exit \"Düsseldorf-Wersten\", again. \\nIf they want to go towards north-east to [[Essen]] or [[Bochum]] they will take the {{Ade|44}} an is possible to get out at the airport as mentioned above. \\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== West towards [[Aachen]], [[Belgium]], [[Paris]] ===\\n====Option 1====\\n{{Coords|51.2009|6.7631}}<br>\\nYou can start from the Aral petrol station at Südring 115. Take tram U72 to \"Südring\". From there walk about 500m the \"Südring\" towards the west. On Saturday evening there\\'s always a \"muscle car\" meeting.\\n\\n====Option 2====\\n{{Coords|51.1245|6.6002}}<br>\\nTake public transportations to the bus stop \\'\\'Grevenbroich, Daimlerstraße\\'\\' in order to get to the \\'\\'Vierwinden\\'\\' petrol station] on the {{Ade|46}} in [[Grevenbroich]]. You can find a schedule at [http://www.vrr.de/de/index.html www.vrr.de]. It\\'s easy to find.

Turn left and walk until you arrive in front of \"Carglas\". There is the best spot for hitchhiking in Düsseldorf. Much traffic at every time of the day with license plates from all over Germany and drivers going for long distances. Even in the dark hours the visibility is very good, thanks to the lights above the street. The minimum you should get is a lift to your destination if it is within the direction of Duisburg, Essen, Bochum and Dortmund or the petrol station along the {{Ade|2}}, called \\'\\'Bottrop-Süd\\'\\' if you want to go further. Waiting takes an average under fifteen minutes.\\n\\n=== North-West towards [[Arnhem]], [[Netherlands]] ===\\n====Option 1====\\nSimilar like to Hamburg.\\n\\n====Option 2====\\n{{Coords|51.5199|6.8592}}<br>\\nTake the train to \\'\\'Oberhausen-Sterkrade\\'\\'. Take the 979 Bus, but get out at \\'\\'Turmstraße\\'\\'. There is an on-ramp for the {{Ade|516}} to Arnhem there, and cars have to wait at traffic lights before going on to the motorway. The next service station is \\'\\'Hünxe\\'\\' on the {{Ade|3}}, which is strongly frequented by Dutch drivers, so if someone offers to take you there, you\\'re probably in luck.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Cologne]], [[Bonn]], [[Frankfurt am Main]] ===\\n====Option 1====\\n{{Coords|51.1573|6.9641}}<rb>\\nTake the public transportations to the petrol station in [[Hilden]], \\'\\'Ohligser Heide\\'\\' at the {{Ade|3}}.

A lot of people stop there, before they go directly to \\'\\'\\'Frankfurt am Main Airport\\'\\'\\'.

This is a good place: cars can see you from a way off, there\\'s plenty of space for them to stop and it is easy to backtrack from if necessary. Don\\'t go with the bus until Ferrytoll, the Park & Ride Area - it\\'s difficult there. This is also a good spot for getting on the M9 to Stirling and the West and North West of Scotland - take a sign saying \"Stirling\". \\n\\nIt is better to get dropped at the Ratho Station and then walk about 5-7 minutes ahead until a roundabout and a BP Petrol station with Mac Donalds appears. Round about is before the petrol station that has Mac Donalds. Here on the left od roundabout, is the M8 going to Glasgow. If you turn left walk about 100 meters and then stand with a sign saying Glasgow drivers will find it easy to see you and even STOP for you. Do not stand too close to the turn, else it is difficult for them to notice you in a second and stop for you, while looking out for cars coming from behind.\\n\\nA harder spot, due to the nature of the junction, is close to the train station Edinburgh Park / Hermiston Gait commercial centre. There is a [[roundabout]] there that precedes the junction of the A8 with the A720 (Edinburgh bypass). The junction itself is a high-traffic area, but the Hermiston Gait roundabout offers some space for cars to stop and some visibility. To get there, simply take the high-frequency Lothian Bus 22 from the centre, and get down right at South Gyle mail centre. There is a walkway after the DHL warehouse (Cultins Rd), which leads to the Edinburgh Park station. Pass the station and turn right on the boulevard: the roundabout is right there.\\n\\n\\n=== North towards [[Perth]]===\\n\\nTo head north (through Perth) the best place seems to be on Queensferry Road, just past Barton junction: plenty of traffic going north, they see you from far and there are many good spots with some space for cars to stop, especially a large bus stop. To get there, take bus 41 (Lothian buses) or 43/X43 (First) from the city centre (George Street, GBP 1.50) and ask the driver to be told when you\\'re at Barnton junction. Follow the bus for about 500 metres and you\\'ll reach said bus stop. A sign might be helpful but is not absolutely necessary.\\n\\n\\n=== Heading South or East ===\\n\\nTo Galashiels / London / Borders\\n\\nThere are four main ways south: the A68, which heads due south through the Borders, the A7 which takes you to Galshiels and then the Borders, the A1, which follows the east coastline, the A702, which heads south-west, through which one will eventually hit the [[M74 (GB)]]\\n\\nTo get on the A68, get a bus until Dalkeith (village south of Edinburgh), ask to drop off in the city center, then get or ask for Newmills road, pass the little river and get Lauder road, pass a traffic light and after, you get to a roundabout that takes you in direction of Lauder, Jedburgh, there is place for cars to stop. Do not walk past this roundabout, there is no good spot further on!  You can get to this roundabout easily from the centre of Edinburgh on bus 3 or 33.  get off at \"Primrose Tce, Dalkeith\" or maybe at \"Hepburn Rd, Dalkeith which is closer but i am sure i didnt see this stop as i walked past.  \\n\\nFor Galashiels ( or the A7 ) best if to catch the bus number 29 from The North Bridge in the direction of Dalkeith. Your station to goto is called Eskbank at Tesco ( Dalkeith ). Tesco is a huge shopping center with a bus stop where Bus No. 29 goes directly while bus number 40 goes after going through the whole town of Dalkeith. \\nRight next to this huge store is a petrol station , get out of here and then is the A7 national road ( historic road ) towards Galashiels. Just walk down here atleast  100 meters away from the circle with a sign and there is plenty of space for cars to stop. \\n\\nThere has been some success getting on the A1 from Tranent: a safer bet is to take the bus 44c from st.Andrews square to Musselburgh, get off before the crossing of the River Esk, and walk south along the river towards the A1. There is a service station there: on occasion rides also go from there down the [[M74 (GB)]] and the A68.\\n\\nTo get on the A1 from Tranent is pretty easy: take the bus number 26 that says Tranent on it, from the centre, it goes through Portobello and Musselburgh in case you\\'re located there. Get off the bus after 30-40 min, ask the driver for the last stop before the bus crosses the A1. Walk alongside the road there and go left on the roundabout and you\\'re already on the sliproad to the A1. You can try it on the road onto it, cause cars are going more slowly, or you just walk til the end of the sliproad and you find the first layby just about a few metres further on, you can see it as you walk along from further away. Here you can get the cars from both directions.\\n\\nTo get on the A702 you need to get to the Esso petrol station at Hillend. Take bus #4 from the city and get off at the first stop after the bus goes over the Edinburgh ring road. It\\'s easy for cars to pull in outside the petrol station, and a busy road. You could also ask drivers at the petrol station. Some anonymous hitchhiker hitched here twice. First time took 10 mins, second took about 50. Probably be quicker for a girl. As an Edinburgh local and someone who has hitchhiked from Edinburgh before I completely agree with this. One piece of advice though - make sure that the person picking you up is going a reasonable distance as you do not want to get stranded somewhere in the Boarders of Scotland (it can be pretty remote)! You get people going almost going as far as London/Dover for work/holidays as the A702 eventually leads onto the [[M74 (GB)]].\\n\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|Scotland}}\\n\\n[[Category:Scotland]]\\n[[Category:E15]]\\n[[Category:E16]]\\n\\n[[fr:Edinburgh]]',\n",

It is also the gateway to [[Taba]] in [[Egypt]], and [[Aqaba]] in [[Jordan]].\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\nEilat has the distinct advantage of having basically only one road out, The \\'\\'Arava Road\\'\\', Number 90. It stretches to the north of the city, and continues all the way up to the [[Dead Sea]], and intersects with the roads to Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.\\n\\n=== To the [[Dead Sea]], [[Jerusalem]] ===\\n__TOC__\\nFrom the main Bus station, walk down the street till you see the entry to the airport. Turn left, pass the small petrol station on your right, continue past another petrol station on your left, and reach the roundabout just after the end of the airport. You hitch from the bus stop. There is no real need of having a sign with you, since there is only one major direction (North!). You should get rides that continue on Road 90, continuing north after the Arava junction (intersction of highway 90 and 25, where the road to Tel Aviv (25) splits from 90 that continues to Jerusalem), and get to your destination along the Dead Sea shore. If you wish to get to [[Jerusalem]], you need to continue hitchhike north till you get to the northernmost tip of the Dead Sea, and hitchhike West on Highway 1.\\n\\n=== To [[Tel Aviv]], [[Be\\'er Sheva]], [[Mitzpe Ramon]] ===\\nHitchhike from the same spot as described above. The road to Tel Aviv passes either through Road 90 till the Arava Junction and than west through Dimona, or up north in Road 90, and than turning left in Ketura Junction and continuing up road 40 till Be\\'er Sheva and Tel Aviv. Highway 40 has much more desert scenery - especially on the approach to Mitzpe Ramon and around Sde Boker, but there is also much less traffic. Try and avoiding getting stuck in the middle of the road, and prefer always petrol stations, rest areas or Kibbutz exits. Remember, this is a desert area! \\n\\nSometimes you can also get a direct ride from Eilat to Tel Aviv. If hitchhiking to Mitzpe Ramon it would be best to use a sign, as most traffic going north out of Eilat will not be travelling on Highway 40. \\n\\n=== To [[Taba]], [[Egypt]] ===\\nThe Egytian border is only 7.5km away, and it\\'s not really feasible to hitchhike there since most drivers will just get you to one of the hotels in the area. Every hour bus line 15 goes from Eilat main Bus station, and will take you till the border for 4.2 NIS.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Border crossing:\\'\\'\\' \\n* You will have to pay an exit fee of 100 shekels in the Israeli border terminal. You are entitled to be exempted of this fee, given you stay only in the Taba area during your entire stay in Egypt - this can be accounted for by showing a reservation to Movenpick, Hilton Taba, Taba Sands or Radisson Blu hotel in Taba. The reservation will be checked with the hotel. There could be a case in which you will be asked to pay the exit fee, and you\\'ll get refunded upon return to Israel showing the check-out receipt with the date of the same day. Alternatively, if you got the exemption but later stayed further into Egypt than Taba, upon re-entry to Israel you\\'d be asked to pay the full exit fee.\\n* The Egyptians issue East-Sinai-only stamps at this crossing, free of charge, so if you want to go to Cairo (actually, any further than Sharm al-Sheikh), they\\'ll make you pay $25 for a visa and anywhere from $100 for \"visa support\"(handwritten note from a \"travel agent\") without which they won\\'t give you the full visa... You can avoid the whole visa nightmare by getting an Egyptian visa in advance (from an embassy/consulate) - either in Eilat (100 shekels, 2014, located on Efroni st.) or in your home country - prices: in London (GBP20, November 2017), Schengen countries (EUR38, November 2017).\\n\\n[[User:Halt,_Stop!_Reudnitz_kommt.|Craig]] found it easy to get a lifts around Eilat, even around the border. Stick out your thumb and walk along the roads (10 mins, 5 mins, 5 mins).\\n\\n[[user:uncle_sam01|uncle_sam01]] found it similarly easy to hitch around Eilat.\\n\\n== Hitchiking In ==\\nCheck the [[Jerusalem]], [[Dead Sea]] and [[Tel Aviv]] articles.\\n\\nFrom Ramon Airport is very easy to hitchhike to Eilat, as it\\'s right on Highway 90. It\\'s a busy road, but you will find a ride to Eilat for sure. Just walk a hundred meters from the airport to the main road and hitchhike from there.\\n\\n== Sleeping ==\\nThere is a beach about 6km south of the city center, before the Egyptian border. Camping is allowed there and you will meet many other travelers, hippies, backpackers,... There is a water source and shower/toilet available closeby at a beach restaurant/bar. There is even free wifi at the beach.\\n\\n{{Cities Israel}}\\n\\n== Resources ==\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n[[he:אילת]]',\n",

There is a bus stop where people can easily stop just by this petrol station. This is a well known spot for hitchhiking, which was very popular in the times when Dutch students still had to pay for public transport. You can get here by taking the bus from the Central Train Station. You have two choices - bus 173 to \\'\\'Floraplein\\'\\' or bus 7 to \\'\\'Korianderstraat\\'\\'.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Maastricht]], [[Aachen]], south-west towards [[Antwerpen|Antwerp]], east to [[Venlo]] ===\\n====Option 1====\\n{{Coords|51.4054|5.4806}}<br>\\nAn alternative for \\'\\'Floraplein\\'\\' is walking 2 km in south west direction. There are two entrances (towards Antwerpen, and Venlo) to the {{Anl|2}} {{Junction}} {{Anl|67}} next to the \\'\\'Van der Valk Hotel Eindhoven\\'\\', at the \\'\\'Aalsterweg\\'\\'. Due to traffic lights, people clearly see you, and can stop easily.\\n\\n====Option 2, Service station Meelakkers====\\n{{Coords|51.4046|5.5404}}<br>\\nAnother option for heading east/Venlo is taking the train to [[Geldrop]] (just about 5min, single-way ticket is 2,30€) and walk about 2km from Geldrop train-station to an Esso petrol station directly on the motorway {{Anl|67}} (only eastwards) south of Geldrop: Leave the train-station towards southwest, cross the whole park and hold left (towards south) until you cross a bigger car-road (Gijezenrooiseweg), still heading south (Laan van Tolkien), pass the supermarket on the left and go straight on through the park in the borough with streets called after Lord of the Rings-characters. You\\'ll find \\'\\'Dwalin\\'\\'-path on the right, it becomes \\'\\'Fili\\'\\'-street. At the end of \\'\\'Fili\\'\\' turn right in \\'\\'Durin\\'\\'-street, follow until the end of the road, turn left in \\'\\'Genoenhuis\\'\\'-road and next oportunity turn right. Follow the road for 200 meters. You\\'ll find yourself on a bridge over the A67, on the right you can see the petrol station very close. Take the steep path on the right at the end of the bridge between the highway-ramp and a fence. After a very few meters is a truck-park and the petrol station, where you can ask people for a ride.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Den Bosch]], [[Amsterdam]] {{Anl|2}} ===\\n{{Coords|51.4832|5.4333}}<br>\\nThis is a good option if you\\'re in the northern part of the city. At the crossing of \\'\\'Boschdijk\\'\\' and \\'\\'Spaaihoefweg\\'\\' there\\'s a small lay-by with space for cars to stop. Very easy to catch a ride to at least petrol station \\'\\'Ooiendonk\\'\\' on the A2.\\n\\n===North, West, South===\\n{{Coords|51.4378|5.4286}}<br>\\nA2 access lane 31 \\'\\'Veldhoven\\'\\' (A2 x Noord-Brabantlaan). Do not confuse with A2 access lane 32 \\'\\'Veldhoven-Zuid\\'\\', this one is quite unsuitable in both directions. Take bus 401/402 from Eindhoven Central Station. Get out at the bus stop just before the motorway (\\'\\'Hurksestraat\\'\\'), should take about 10 minutes. There are traffic lights to stand beside nearby. You can also ask around at the McD.\\n\\n\\'\\'\"When I hitched to A\\'dam I stood in the Noord Brabantlaan at the ramp on the A2 towards north. (bus 401/402, bus-stop \"Hurksestraat\") There\\'s plenty space to stop for the cars, but it\\'s better to thumb as to use a sign! If you want to go towards north on the A2 and cannot find a long-distance-ride, try to catch a ride to the Texaco petrol station on the A2, which is before the towns of Broxtel and Liempde (just about 8km north of Eindhoven).\"\\'\\'\\n\\n=== North towards [[Nijmegen]] {{Anl|50}} ===\\n{{Coords|51.4793|5.4893}}<br>\\nThere is a Shell petrol station on the \\'\\'J.F. Kennedylaan\\'\\'. Go there to find a lift to the {{Anl|50}}. Hitchhiking on the road itself is not allowed because of the status of the road, although you might get away. The road has an emergency lane with traffic limited to 70 km/h. You may as well stand on the merging lane of the petrol station.\\n\\nThis gas station is really small, but it still could be possible to find a ride here. Myself, I did not like the place too much so I walked direction A50 to Nijmegen. If you decide to leave the gas station, you can walk for about 30+ minutes. At a certain point just before the actual ramp is a very tiny triangelish place of tarmac where a car can stop. However, this is far from an ideal spot. The flow of traffic is very dense. Go stand about 10-15 meters in front of the little spot so the car can stop on the tarmac. If you don\\'t find a ride at the gasstation, this is an option to consider. This place might work better out of rush hour so there is more space and time between each car.Be carefull!--[[User:Robbel|Robbel]] ([[User talk:Robbel|talk]]) 13:39, 15 November 2013 (CET)\\n\\nThe employees at this petrol station might send you away, or tell you that standing on the emergency lane is too dangerous. Another option is to stand at  the acceslane from \"Tempellaan\", there\\'s an emergency lane here where cars can easily stop.\\n\\n=== From the [[airport]] ===\\nWhen you arrive at the airport, just follow the signs to the motorway, you\\'ll reach it in 15 Minutes. The airport traffic merges here with the traffic from the city, so it\\'s easy to get a ride, but you will need a sign. According to Fverhart due to the motorway works this A2 access lane 30 \\'\\'Eindhoven Airport\\'\\' is not suitable any more to the north, to the south unknown. Alternative, walk further on the Anthony Fokkerweg until a small side-road and hitchhike there, or walk further to the second road crossing after the motorway. There is a bus stop, use sign. Or in stead walk towards the south-east for three kilometres to A2 access lane 31 \\'\\'Veldhoven\\'\\'. Or try to find a ride on the parking area of the airport.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n<!--Infoboxes and categorys.

This ramp is the 2nd last before the German border, try to get to the parking area at the border, there you can find trucks that might go up to [[Poland]] and further beyond. If you like going faster, check out the article for the A30, it\\'s practically better to catch a car towards the on-ramp Nordhorn/Bentheim and from there getting rides eastwards much faster.

For hitchhiking towards Gronau use the space in front of the traffic lights or walk a bit down the ramp.\\n\\n====Option 3====\\nSee section above, the petrol station north of Enschede works well to go towards Germany.\\n\\n=== West towards [[Hengelo]], [[Apeldoorn]], [[Utrecht]], [[Amsterdam]] ===\\n====Option 1====\\n{{Coords|52.2012|6.8901}}<br>\\nTo get on the [[A35 (Netherlands)|A35]] you just have to go to the Zuiderval. Take bus #2 towards \\'\\'Helmerhoek\\'\\' and get out at the \\'\\'P+R Zuiderval\\'\\' and walk to the higway (150 meters). You can also take line #1; for this see the spot for direction Münster. Also lines #73 and #74 take you there as written above. There are traffic lights and enough space for cars to stop. Use a sign with \\'\\'Deventer\\'\\' and try to get a lift to the petrol station before Deventer.\\n\\n====Option 2====\\nTake bus #1 towards \\'\\'Universiteit\\'\\' and get out at \\'\\'Jupiterstraat\\'\\'. Walk 200m up towards the intersection and walk left. 20m behind the roundabout you\\'ll find an information bay which is perfect for hitchhiking rides towards [[Germany]] or all into the [[Netherlands]] (Haaksbergen, Deventer, Utrecht, etc.). It might be that rides bring you only about 3 km further to the beginning of the bypass that leads to the A35. From there, it\\'s a 5 minute walk along the bypass towards the on-ramp of the highway either going deeper into the Netherlands (Hengelo, Deventer) or towards Münster in Germany. The on-ramp is close to the Grolsch beer brewery, though it is not allowed to walk or hitchhike near the ramp to the highway.\\n\\nThough both these options will work when you\\'re patient enough,  it might be wiser to take the bus to Hengelo and try there near the Gas station located just 400 metres before the ramp to the highway. For more on this option: see [[Hengelo]]\\n\\n[[File:Oldenzaal_ramp.jpg|thumb|250px|left|On-ramp [[Oldenzaal]]-Zuid towards [[Germany]].]]\\n\\n=== All other directions ===\\n Info seems outdated. Please update!\\nIf you are at the University of Twente, try this: Go to the entry of the University, walk the \"Auke Vleerstraat\" to the second intersection with traffic lights and hitchhike just behind it at the information bay. Great spot for rides into the Netherlands, towards Germany (Münster), within Enschede or Haaksbergen, though waiting times can differ during the day. This is actually the same spot as #Option 2 above here.\\n\\n== Sleeping ==\\nIt\\'s possible to camp somewhere on the University campus, if you ask the security guys at the campus entry kindly to put your tent on a hidden spot somewhere between the trees. There\\'s much green on the campus, only thing will be geese that are hanging around there. ;) There\\'s also a campsite between [[Hengelo]] and \\'\\'\\'{{FULLPAGENAME}}\\'\\'\\', not far from the University.

The bus station is about 1km away from the ramp and next to a parking lot. Better bring a sign that points out your direction. Or hitch first eastwards to the gas station Eichelborn and change direction there.\\n\\n====Option 2====\\nTake the tram number 4 in the direction \\'Flughafen Erfurt\\' (Erfurt airport). Exit at \"Volkenroder Weg\" and you\\'ll see two petrol stations. Between them there is enough space for cars to stop if you stand on the roadside with a sign \"A71\".

Go to \\'\\'\\'Weimarsche Straße\\'\\'\\'. There are two lanes and traffic lights and a bike path along the road. It does not have a border stone so cars can stop easily. Bring a sign \"JENA\" or \"A4\".

From there it\\'s a 30 minutes walk to the gas station [[Hörselgau Nord]]. Note that there is only a gas station in direction Frankfurt. Once you got off from the train turn right onto the main street (Fröttstädter Straße) and follow it about a kilometre to it\\'s end.

Turn right on \"Arnstädter Straße\" and then the second left on \"Talstraße\". After passing the last house to your right, turn right and walk the field path approximatly ten minutes to the gas stations \"Thüringer Wald Nord\". On your way you\\'ll cross beneath the Autobahn. \\n\\n=== West towards Gotha or [[Eisenach]] (Bundestraße B7) ===\\nTake tram number 2 from the city center to the commercial fairground and exhibition center [http://www.messe-erfurt.de/ Messe Erfurt] to the stop \\'mdr/kinderkanal\\' or \\'messe\\', walk over \\'Gothaer Straße\\' to the \\'Real\\' supermarket and ask drivers standing at the traffic light.\\n\\n\\n== Hitchhiking in ==\\nAs most people tend to pass Erfurt on {{Ade|4}} ask to be dropped of at \"Urbicher Kreuz\".

At the next traffic lights you have to cross the big main road \"Alfredstraße\" or \"B224\" and turn right. You should now see the bridge you have to pass and afterwards turn left. Now you will find yourself on a walkway next to the ramp. There is a lot of traffic, with a lot of cars going to Düsseldorf or Cologne.

This is of course assuming you look clean, sane and friendly... also there needs to be a reasonable flow of traffic and since Devon has the most milage of road compared to any other County, this could mean one car an hour is not uncommon on the single track lanes between villages.\\n\\nExeter is normally easy if you know where to go, take a look at a map for the green \\'A\\' roads heading out to your respective destination and jsut head for the juncton you see on the map. Dual carriagways are not Motorways and so it is not technically illegal to hitch on one, however it is ill advised. If police or more likely some stuck up locals tell you to move, there is no legal reason to do so unless you are being a fool.\\n\\nThe M5 heading north is the only restriction to where you are legally allowed to hitch. However it starts quite early into the center of Exeter and there are pavements here and there that most people are happy to pull over onto even in the suburbs of Exeter. My advice would be to either find a layby where you can hitch before the M5 or get a bus a little further to the next village/town and hitch on a slip road.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n=== South to Land\\'s End ===\\nBe careful, while the the M5 seems to continue southbound, it actually becomes the A30 within miles. If you\\'re just passing it\\'s worth trying your luck around Exeter Services, while there is no space to pull over near the on ramp there\\'s a bus stop on the A376 shortly before it joins the roundabout.\\n\\n=== North to Bristol ===\\nExeter Services seem to be rarely frequented by people heading North, it seems better to walk ~15min to Junction 29 although there\\'s little space to pull over near the on ramp.\\nHoniton road is likely your best bet, though Jass waited over an hour there last time. Having a sign for Collompton Services could be the best bet here. From there, you\\'re golden. Careful about getting out at Gordano Services (just around Bristol if you\\'re heading past it)...it always takes forever to get out, but particularly going north/west to Wales. Anywhere on the M4 is fantastic for Wales, even if it means going back on yourself a little. \\nAlphington Road is another option....while it could take a while, there\\'s a lot of traffic taking the south exit to go north too. Take the last petrol station and make a large sign (the entrance to the motorway isn\\'t worth checking out, very little visibility).\\n\\n=== North East to London ===\\nWhile some people might go to London via the M5/M4 avoiding the switchover around Bristol and taking the A30 seems to be a better option. It is possible to hitch out from around M5 junction 29 but there isn\\'t much space to pull over anywhere.\\n\\n=== West to Dartmoor ===\\nTake Alphington Road all the way to the roundabout / flyover. Cross underneath it and you\\'ll find a road on your right heading to Dartmoor/Cornwall. A lot easier to get to than Exeter Services unless you happen to be up north, and everyone who takes this road is going to be going at least to Dartmoor, if not further.

There are many farmers who drive around the island and look after their cows, which are often distributed among different meadows. They are more than happy to carry strangers either in the front or back of their pick-up trucks. The back is usually used for animals, so you might get a little dirty.

Otherwise you have to fly in, either from [[Lisbon]] or from several of the other islands of the Azores. Within the Azores, you can also take a ferry.

[[Stanley]], the biggest town there, is not counting more than 2,000 inhabitants. The [[hitchhiking]] conditions for this part of the world seem to be rather bad, but there ''are'' chances to get around for free. Don't hesitate to try it!\\n\\n== Get in ==\\nWhen entering, you have to show that you have a return ticket, accommodation and enough money to cover your expenses. You need to pay a departure tax of £20 when you are leaving the islands from Mount Pleasant Airport.

It is also a military base at the same time. There's a weekly flight from [[Santiago de Chile]] also stopping in [[Punta Arenas]] ([[Chile|CL]]) and [[Rio Gallegos]] ([[Argentina|AR]]) by LanChile. Flights from [[Europe]] for commercial passengers are operated by the UK Royal Air Force. These flights last 18 hours, start in RAF Brize Norton, in the [[South East England|south east of England]] and have a stop on [[Ascension Island]].\\n\\nThe airport is 56km (35 miles) from Stanley. Tourists arriving at the airport usually either take a shuttle bus or a [[taxi]] to Stanley.\\n\\n=== By [[hitchhiking a boat|boat]] ===\\nLarge cruise ships are coming to the Port of Stanley in summer. Some of them also stop at other islands where landing will be done using small inflatable boats.\\n\\n== Get around ==\\nThere's a regular ferry between New Haven to Port Howard. \\n\\nYou can expect only the roads in Stanley to be paved. The other roads are not paved and can be in a shape that requires an off-road vehicle.\\n\\n=== Between the islands ===\\nPublic planes for travelling between islands are operated by Falkland Islands Government Air Service (FIGAS). They can take eight passengers and the pilot. Reservations are required for normal passengers. Fares can be ~£50 for the longest distance and baggage limit is 14kg (you need to pay £0.60 per additional kilogram).\\n\\nThere is no regular boat service between the islands. An island's owner can charge per-person landing fees.\\n\\n== Else ==\\nThere are bed and breakfasts in Stanley. [[Camping]] needs permission of the landowner.\\n\\nNot all the mines from the 1982 Falkland War have been cleared. It is absolutely not likely that a usual visitor will encounter one.

There is no problem to get in and out of Fethiye in any direction since there is a lot of traffic. You should aim to get to the national main-road [[D400 (Turkey)|D400]] either on Dolmuş or hitchhiking away from the center of the city following the signs for [[Muğla]] or [[Antalya]]. If you wish to get a Dolmuş, then your best bet is to take one heading towards Yanniklar, then get off once you hit the [[D400 (Turkey)|D400]].\\n\\nIf hitching on the small road towards Oludeniz, be aware that the last bit of town near the Lycean graves is a bit dodgy.

It is divided into two main municipalities: [[Santa Cruz das Flores]] and [[Lajes das Flores]].\\n\\n== Hitchhiking ==\\nFlores is a small island, so hitchhiking is quite easy. Many people will drive you straight to your destination, even if they hadn\\'t planned going there. Most roads are in a very good shape, although walking along them can be tiring due to the mountainous landscape. The weather is not very stable, so getting wet while waiting is quite likely. However, [[rain]] usually doesn\\'t last very long. There is no public transport.\\n\\n== How to get there ==\\nFlores can be reached on [[hitchhiking a sailboat|sailing boats]], but it is not a popular destination for sailors. Most people get there by ferry or airplane from the other islands of the Azores. There are no direct connections to mainland [[Portugal]]. See [[Azores#Useful information|useful information]] for tips on saving money when taking a ferry. Ferries to [[Corvo]] and [[Faial]] leave from Lajes, while the airport is located in Santa Cruz. Ferries going to the Central group only run in summer and are sometimes cancelled due to bad weather.\\n\\n== Useful information ==\\nAs on all of the islands of the archipelago, there are many walking trails. Take trail PR4FLO to Fajã de Lopo Vaz at the southern part of the island for having a free shower at a very nice beach.

Most of the city, including its centre is located on the Island of Santa Catarina which is connected with the mainland by bridge.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n=== South towards [[Criciúma]] and [[Porto Alegre]] (BR-101)===\\n\\nFrom the Terminal Centro bus station take a bus to Palhoça. They leave from the end of platform C and cost 4.50 reais. There are a few lines so ask for the one going close to Posto Catarinão. Get off at the last stop, walk straight under the motorway and turn right (north). You will see the Shell sign from the bus stop. You can ask around or hitch at the entrance to the motorway which has a wide merge lane.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Curitiba]] and [[São Paulo]] (BR-101)===\\n\\n====Hitching spots====\\nThere really isn\\'t an ideal place to hitch from.  However, we\\'ve tried a few options such as a speed bump, a gas station and a Police Station (PRF).\\n\\n===== Just before the highway =====\\nThere is a speed bump right before where Rua Leoberto Leal joins with the main highway.  Right after the bump is a small space that a car could pull over in to stop without blocking traffic.  And then just after that is the entrance ramp to the main highway.  Any bus headed towards Biguaçu should bring you here.\\n\\n=====Gas station=====\\nAnother option is to stay on the bus to Biguaçu until the end of the line.  There is a small gas station here.  Most traffic here is not going far and many cars are just turning around to head back into the city 500 meters up the road.  But about 8.7 kilometers up the road is a nice sized gas station with easy on/off access from the highway.  Any vehicle not turning around should pass it as it is before the turn for Governador Celso Ramos. (Definitely helps though if you speak Portuguese to explain what you want to drivers.)\\n\\n=====Federal Highway Police Station (PRF)=====\\nSome local hitchhikers usually prefer to hitch nearby the PRF\\'s. There\\'s one just after the town of Biguaçu and before the town of Governador Celso Ramos (-27.470548, -48.641283). To get here, take a bus to Terminal Central (TICEN) within Florianópolis island, and then walk to the former bus station (be aware this is NOT the city\\'s bus station - the one you should go to is located next to the Municipal Market). From the former bus station, take a bus towards \\'\\'Governador Celso Ramos\\'\\', \\'\\'Armação\\'\\' or \\'\\'Palmas\\'\\'. As of Nov 2018, the bus to \\'\\'Governador Celso Ramos\\'\\' will cost you R$ 8,10. All the 3 mentioned buses should drive you past the PRF that you want to stand hitchhiking. So, either you ask the bus driver to let you know when you pass by the \"Polícia Rodoviária\"; you look it up on your phone\\'s map; or you pay attention to what you see outside from the right windows. 100 meters after the PRF is the bus stop where you want to get off.\\n\\n====Once you got your first ride====\\nOnce you got on your first ride out of Florianópolis region towards Curitiba, if they\\'re only driving you for some kilometers (like to the town of Balneário Camboriú for instance), ask them to get off at Itapema PRF (yes, there\\'s another PRF there which is usually a nice spot to hitch from towards Curitiba as well).\\n\\n=== West towards [[Foz do Iguaçu]]  (BR-282)===\\nTo avoid the crowded BR-101, you can go via the beautiful interior of Santa Catarina via BR-282. To do so, take a public bus to Aguas Mornas and start hitching in the roundabout. Take your time, enjoy the scenery and relaxed people, far from the fear and stress of big cities!\\n\\n== Public transport ==\\n\\nFrom the Terminal Centro you can take a bus to other parts of the island for as little as 2.75 reais.

From the roundabout it is possible to hitch to the east ([[Edessa]], [[Thessaloniki]], [[Istanbul]]) or to the south or west ([[Kastoria]], [[Ioannina]]) or even to the north to [[North Macedonia]]. To the border with North Macedonia is almost no traffic, it seems that neither the Greeks nor the North Macedonians cross the border often.

Had a sign in the Greek script indicating Niki (the border town), but gave up after almost 3 hours in spite of quite a bit of traffic on that road. As there is no local bus to Niki, I had to take a taxi, as I didn't want to be crossing the border on foot after dark. Bargained the taxi down to €15 (18km trip). It was the culmination of a totally fruitless quest to hitchhike in Greece. Crossing the border on foot was absolutely no problem, and I immediately put my Greek experience behind me by getting picked up by the second car that passed me.'' \\n\\n''Though 2017 was my first visit to Greece, I get the feeling that things may have changed as a result of the migrant crisis from 2015 onwards.'' - [[jamesor2]]\\n\\n{{IsIn|Greece}}\\n\\n[[Category:Greece]]\\n[[Category:E86]]\",\n",

It lies some 35 km northwest of Frankfurt. This is a very busy service station and you should be able to quickly find a ride directly to central Frankfurt. If you miss that stop, there won\\'t be any other good places to be dropped out until close to Darmstadt (unless of course, the driver is willing to make a detour to leave you at Frankfurt Airport).\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n=== North ([[Kassel]], [[Hannover]]), West ([[Wiesbaden]], [[Mainz]]) and South ([[Karlsruhe]], [[Strasbourg]], [[Basel]]) {{Autobahn|5}} ===\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nA good spot for getting rides out of Frankfurt in every direction is on the B8, on the start of the Theodor-Heuss-Allee near the center of the city. The spot is a bus stop on Theodor-Heuss-Allee, about 40 metres after a roundabout next to Messeturm skyscraper. Take the U-Bahn line U4, or Straßenbahn line 16 or 17, to Festhalle/Messe. Or walk from the Hauptbahnhof north for approximately 15 minutes to Messeturm skyscraper.\\n\\nTraffic is very busy and slow here every day from 7:00 to 20:00. The rate at which people pick up hitch hikers here is reportedly very low (twits will also make a variety of offensive gestures at you so be prepared) but with so much traffic going in every direction you can eventually get a ride.\\n\\nThe next good hitch hiking spot on A5/E451 in northern direction is Raststätte Wetterau and is a better spot to look for longer rides so try to get a ride to there if you are heading north.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nTake tram No. 17 from Frankfurt DB main train station until the last stop \"Am Rebstockbad\" ([http://g.co/maps/6h9fe Map]. This takes you about 10 minutes. From the final stop Am Rebstockbad you can already see the motorway (A648) which interchanges some 700 meter westward on the A5 (north/soutward). When you arrive at the (eastbound) Esso gas station on the side that leads into Frankfurt - walk westward along the Autobahn and cross at a road bridge 200-300 meters away. Cars that refuel at the opposite (westbound)  gas station will in almost every case travel either northward Kassel, Hannover or southward Darmstadt, Basel] on the Autobahn A5.\\n\\n=== North ([[Kassel]], [[Hannover]], [[Gießen]], [[Marburg]]) {{Autobahn|5}} ===\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nThe Friedberger Landstrasse street is often used to leave the city towards the [[A5 (Germany)|Autobahn A5]] North. From theKonstablerwache city centre, walk 2 km or take the tram 18 / bus 30 till the stop Münzenberger Str. Hitchhike on this road about 150 m before the entrance of the supermarket \\'Lidl\\' ([http://g.co/maps/pymu4 Map]). You definitely need a sign with A5 on it because many cars go to other  directions. It is a perfect spot to get a ride to the the rest area Wetterau.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\' Rest area Gräfenhausen in the south of Frankfurt\\n\\nTake suburban train (S-Bahn) S3 indicating: Darmstadt to the stop Erzhausen, leave the station and walk through the town Erzhausen on Bahnstraße and Hauptstraße westward until you can hear the [[A5 (Germany)|Autobahn A5]]. At some point, you will see a sign pointing left to a Schützenhaus, follow this direction, continue straight beyond the clubhouse and you will arrive at [http://www.serways.de/standorte/standorte/Gr%C3%A4fenhausen%20Ost Rastanlage Gräfenhausen Ost] ([http://g.co/maps/wjg7k Map]). It takes 50-60 minutes from the city center.. There is plenty of long distance traffic 24 hours a day at this spot, a restaurant as well as a small supermarket!\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nTake the Metro to Kalbach Line U2 or U9, underpass the highway and take the second street right (treet is called Am Martinszehnten\". There is a petrol station called Hessol and a McDonalds, which are close to A5. As the petrol station is cheap it is frequently used and you can easily get a ride from there to the A5 to service station Wetterau wich is a good spot to find long-distance lifts.\\n\\nJune 12th 2024, Comment: We only found local traffic at the Hessol gas station, maybe due to the fact that we arrived there around noon. However, following the road towards the highway ramp we found a gravel spot on the shoulder just after the last traffic light before the highway ramp. Here, cars can stop and you are visible from ~50-100m ahead. It took 30min to get a ride using a sign saying \"A5, Wetterau, Gießen\"\\n\\n=== South ([[Karlsruhe]], [[Strasbourg]], [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]]) {{Autobahn|5}} ===\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nGo by subway (U-Bahn) line U7 to the last stop Heerstraße, continue walking the path along the rail-track on the left side northward. Walk over the path/road between the fields until the Autobahn and cross via the underpass. You´ll see a small steep footpath on the right. Go there and you are on the rest area Taunusblick on the [[A5 (Germany)|A5]]. The whole journey takes not more than 25/30 minutes from the city center, you can get on the underground at Hauptwache and Konstablerwache - two main underground stations in the city centre, in the end you have 10 minutes walking only. Attention: There is no exit or entrance for cars going north on A5/E451! You can only use the rest area Taunusblick to travel South\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\' Rest area Gräfenhausen  in the south of Frankfurt\\n\\nTake suburban train S-Bahn S3 indicating Darmstadt] to the stop \\'Erzhausen, leave the station and walk through the town Erzhausen on Bahnstraße and Hauptstraße.

Take bus number 30 or 36 from the station to the stop Sachsenhausen - Hainer Weg. Bundesstraße 3 (Babenhäuser Landstraße) is right at the busstop, there is a restarea which you can reach by crossing the road. Attention: Think twice if someone offers you a ride to the petrol station nearby, by taking it you will lose this spot and might end up waiting for hours.\\n\\nAlternative which takes you to the service area mentioned above. Take S1 train to Rodgau-Weiskirchen then walk along Bahnhofstrasse until you reach Hauptstrasse turn right and then take first left into Shillerstrass. Follow Shillerstrasse until you reach into the forest and then take first road going left. This will take you straight to the Service area. It takes approximately 40 minutes.\\n\\n=== West ([[Cologne|Köln]], [[Dortmund]]) and East ([[Würzburg]], [[Munich]]) {{Autobahn|3}} ===\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nRastanlage Weiskirchen has two sides, north and south for going east or west. A bridge over A3/E42 (east of the station) connects both sides. From Frankfurt you can reach this place in around 60 minutes. From Frankfurt DB main train station, you should take S-Bahn S1 direction: Rödermark Ober-Roden to the stop Weiskirchen. Wander through the town on Bahnhofstraße, Schillerstraße and Pommernstraße, later through the cropfields first in east- then in northward direction until you can see the Autobahn.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\' Rest area Theißtal west of Frankfurt\\n\\nAn alternative, if you want to leave Frankfurt for Köln and further north or west, is the rest area Theißtal along the [[A3 (Germany)|Autobahn A3]]. Take the S-Bahn (S2) towards Niedernhausen (final stop, about 30 minutes). You\\'ll hear the Autobahn once you are there. Walk 1.5 km (20 min) northwestwards. There is a tiny footpath through the woods leading all the way to the motorway rest area, and if you try to stick close to the Autobahn, you shouldn\\'t miss it. You\\'ll walk past a shooting range, and when you reach a 100m diameter clearing in the woods, you\\'re there. Most cars here go at least to Köln/Bonn if they don\\'t go to Koblenz, since there isn\\'t much else on the way. There is a fence between the woods and the rest area\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3\\'\\'\\' Medenbach service station probably best option to go towards Cologne\\n\\nThis option has a fair bit of potential walking but leaves you at a well visited service station on the A3 to the West of Frankfurt and really only ends up being one or 2 kilometers more of a walk compared to the first option.  Take the S-Bahn S2 towards Niedernhausen and get off at Eppstein-Bremthal.  You can save a kilometer of uphill walking by taking bus 20 (just outside the station and easy to board without a ticket because you can enter in the back doors) for 3 (possibly 4) stops to bus stop Waldallee.  (The stop is immediately after the bus turns right after reach the top of the hill.  You then have a 5 kilometer walk to the service station but could also hitch a ride most of the way.    Going the opposite direction of the bus, walk along the L3017 passing through the town of Wildsachsen.  About a kilometer past the town, turn right onto L3018.  (It veers slightly away from the previous road heading up a hill.  Walk 500 meters and turn left onto the path.  (Or if you want to go south keep going until you pass under the autobahn.)  Walk about 700 meters on the path and you will be able to turn right on a road that leads to the service station.  You can then turn left and follow it until you come out near the gas station or just after the green fence you can turn right and take the elevator down to the ground level and emerge in the parking area near the restaurant.  You\\'ll have to press the door open button to get the doors to open.  From here you could easily get a ride even as far as Belgium or the Netherlands.\\n\\n=== From the airport ===\\n\\n[[File:Frankfurtairportcarparkexit.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Craig stood in front of that traffic sign]]\\n\\nThere are two good spots at the car park. Go to the arrival level in front of Terminal 1. You can now enter a throughway beneath the brownish Sheraton building that is opposite to Terminal 1 Part C. There is a delivery area of the Sheraton, great spot. Slow traffic and a lot of space for stopping. You should be able to spot the main car park exit. You can follow the cars further down some 100 meters to find a spot in the sunlight. Note that most traffic will go south!\\n\\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n__NOTOC__\\n\\n[[Category:Hesse]]\\n[[Category:Germany]]\\n[[Category:E42]]\\n\\n[[de:Frankfurt am Main]]',\n",

If you do end up here, then check out the graffiti, and try and make some friends to take you to the squat, which is almost a museum of graffiti.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n=== West towards [[Berlin]] {{European Route Number|30}} ===\\n\\n\\nIf you want to go to Berlin, or generally direction west, take tram #1 or #5 in the direction \\'\\'Neuberesinnschen\\'\\' ( 1,40 Euro, April 2013) and get off at the last stop. Then walk some 100 metre along the street \\'\\'Mühlenweg\\'\\'. You will see a Shell petrol station on the other side of the street. You can hitchhike at the exit of the station. It usually takes 10-20 minutes until somebody offers a ride. You can also hitchhike where the turn-off to the gas station begins, close to the traffic light. This has the advantage that drivers will see you from further away and often stop or slow down due to red light. A lot of cars will turn there, because it is a short cut for many people (via the gas station), so don\\'t be irritated. \\n\\nEven if you are not going to Berlin, it might help to have a sign for Berlin when hitchhiking at the exit of the petrol station to get a lift out of the city.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Poznań]], [[Warsaw]] {{European Route Number|30}} ===\\n\\nHitchhiking into Poland is best done from point where the E30 crosses the border. This border station is actually on the Polish side, because the actual border is in the middle of the river Oder. To get there on foot you have two options: one will take you for sure an hour, maybe 90 minutes, if you know the way and the other only 15 minutes but you have to walk along the motorway which is forbidden in Germany. \\n\\nFor the first option take tram #1 in the direction \\'\\'Lebuser Vorstadt\\'\\' and get out at the station \\'\\'Magistrale\\'\\' (it\\'s very close to the McDonalds). Now you have to walk for a very long time. First of all you have to cross into Poland via the city bridge and then head right on the street \\'\\'1 Maja\\'\\'. After some 30 minutes you\\'ll pass the bazaar and 300 metres later take the road which splits from \\'\\'1 Maja\\'\\' to the right. This street\\'s name is \\'\\'Powstancow Wielkopolskich\\'\\'. Keep on walking on this street until another fork in the road. Take this fork and keep on walking. After about 50 minutes you\\'ll reach the border station.\\n\\nAlong that route you will pass a bunch of petrol stations, beginning at the bazaar, where you might ask a truck driver (look out for the TIR label) or a passenger car heading towards Poznan (number plate PXX) or Warsaw (WXX). Probably the best petrol station is Ecotank where you can find a lot of truck drivers resting.\\n\\nFor the faster option take bus #984 from the central station \\'Bahnhof\\' to the stop \\'Leinengasse\\'. You will notice that you pass the highway just before the bus stop already. Walk back, make your way to the highway and start walking. It is about 2km to the border station. Be aware that the bus runs not very often, so check [http://www.svf-ffo.de/fahrgastinfo/liniennetzfahrplan/Folder/Linie984.pdf the schedule] before hand.\\n\\n=== East & West - Alternative {{European Route Number|30}} ===\\n\\n\\nA very good way to hitch out of the city is going to the petrol station \"Biegener Hellen\" on the motorway A12 (Berlin - Poland). To get there take a train from Frankfurt to \\'\\'\\'Pillgram\\'\\'\\'. The train goes once per hour, takes less than 10 minutes. From the train station in Pillgram follow the street \"Zum Bahnhof\" until the end, turn left and the next big street right. Walk for some minutes and you will get out of the village. There will be a small path for workers of the petrol station. This path will take you to the petrol station. Traffic is not huge because most people prefer to fill gas in Poland where it\\'s cheaper, but still it is no bad spot.\\nIn total you have to walk for two kilometres, but it is by far the best option to get out of the Frankfurt and Słubice.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|Germany}}\\n\\n[[Category:Brandenburg]]\\n[[Category:E30]]\\n[[Category:Germany]]\\n\\n[[de:Frankfurt an der Oder]]',\n",

You can get there with tram line 2 towards \\'\\'Zähringen\\'\\', get out at the last station. From there it\\'s a 400 meters walking to the spot. Try to get a ride from there to the [[A5 (Germany)|A5]] direction south. This way you pass by the service station \\'\\'Schauinsland\\'\\' which is the last one before France.\\n\\nI recommend hitching from the Aral petrol station on Leo-Wohleb-Straße 2. Freiburg is relatively small, so if you are in the city anyway you can very easily walk to this spot. This road goes along the Dreisam river and leads onto the A5 autobahn. In fact you will pass the hitching spot recommended in the first paragraph. I don\\'t recommend that spot because its a 4-lane traffic and difficult for cars to pull over, although many people hitch from there. Waiting times at that Aral petrol station vary but it is recommended to start early so you catch workers commuting to other cities. You\\'ll get drivers going north and south, you just need to ask around.\\n\\nI also recommend the areal petrol station.\\n To get there by public transport you may take tram number 1 direction \\'\\'Littenweiler\\'\\' and get  off at \\'\\'Brauerei Ganter\\'\\'. You can see the blue Aral station on the other side of the street. \\n You should get a ride within minutes.\\n\\n== Hitching In ==\\nOne option is to get off at \\'\\'Schauninsland\\'\\' petrol station if you are coming from the north where you can walk to the next village (Hochdorf) and take the bus 25 or 36 to Freiburg. It will take about 40 minutes to the centre. It\\'s better to find someone in [[Mahlberg]], [[Baden-Baden|Baden Baden]] or [[Bruchsal]] who is going straight into town. The motorway doesn\\'t go directly through the city so drivers are unlikely to go 15 km extra just to drop you off in the city if they want to continue their trip. \\n\\nIf you are coming from the south you can get off at the \\'\\'Breisgau\\'\\' service station. There shouldn\\'t be a problem with finding someone who is going into town.\\n\\nAnother solution, though not the best one, is to get off at exit 61 \\'\\'Freiburg Nord\\'\\' on the A5. The driver can make U-Turn and get back on the motorway (well, if it\\'s not a truck). There\\'s not really much space to stop, so you\\'ll have to ask people stopping on the red light, most of them will be going to the city. Better don\\'t go there if you\\'re not alone, as you\\'ll have to hop in very quickly.\\n\\n== Public transport ==\\nPeople who have the transferable monthly ticket \\'\\'RegioKarte Übertragbar\\'\\' can take along another adult on Sundays and holidays. Students of Freiburg University don\\'t pay after 19h30 on buses trams and trains within a certain region, and on Friday and Saturday, there are trams running all night. It does not include night buses. Not so many controllers, but they appear out of the blue undercover.\\n\\n== abgefahren e.V. ==\\nThe german autostop club [[abgefahren e.V.]] is very active in Freiburg. In September 2007, [[abgefahren e.V.]] held its first gathering near Freiburg and also published the first (un)official German hitchhiking-spot in Freiburg. In 2011 abgefahren started their 4th race in Freiburg the [[abgefahren hitchhiking race 2011]].\\n\\n== Sleeping ==\\nJust take the map of Freiburg ( there will you see the \"camping place\" ).

There are toilets, money exchange, really slow traffic, and friendly environment. You can get very close to it by taking Geneve public transport buses. Lines 4(red) and D(light pink)stop closest to it. 42 also brings you close. Lines 4 and D leave from Bel Air (very central). You have to get out at Perly Village (note: in 2012 the stop is not called Perly-Village any more, but Ravières). Do NOT go until Perly Douane!  From the Perly Village bus stop you cross the road, walk back 10 meters and turn right. (The left of the bus you just got off from.) You walk straight on the little street until you get to the bridge above the motorway. There is a short wire fence but people already bent the top of it, it is easy to hop over. After descending to the motorway, you turn right, and walk until the border. There is a concrete pavement outside the hard shoulder, you can walk safely to the spot. There is lot of traffic, straight ride to Paris possible!\\nThe walking takes 20 min more or less. It is useful to ask for a big public transport map, in hostels for example. - the one with the streets shows you where to walk. \\n=== UPDATE ===\\nAlternatively, you may skip the option of hopping over the wire fence and walking on the highway. About 15 meters to the bridge there is a little tarred street on your right called Chemin des Jules, along an agricultural field, just walk on it till the end and you will see a door on the left that opens directly to the border.\\n\\n\\nIf you want to try it from inside the city, then:\\nTake the bus 23, 28, 57 or 'Y' if you are at the Airport, or the tram 14 or 16 from the train station, and stop at ''Blandonnet''. Walk about 600m to the next on-ramp in direction of South, the one leading to the highway in the direction of South from ''Route de Vernier''. The position is NOT very good because the cars speed up and visibility is not really good but there´s place for cars to stop. You can begin hitch-hiking just after the traffic light, before the bend. Take a ride at least 10km South to the Swiss-French border, where there´s a decent spot to continue. Walk through the customs and hitchhike - preferably with a sign - before the cars speed up. There´s not much space for cars to stop but they can, speed is low and all the traffic is passing through the customs.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|Switzerland}}\\n{{Template:Cities Switzerland}}\\n\\n[[Category:Switzerland]]\\n[[Category:E21]]\\n[[Category:E25]]\\n[[Category:E62]]\\n\\n[[fr:Genève]]\",\n",

Standing a few meters behind the pedestrian crossing is ideal, cars will often have to stop for other pedestrians and have plenty of time to contemplate whether they want to give you a ride or not. The entrance of the warehouse is big and barely used, so plenty of space for the cars to stop as well.\\n\\n=== East towards [[La Spezia]] {{European Route Number|80}} ===\\n\\nThere is a petrol station near the motorway in the community Nervi. Take the bus 17 from the centre of Genova and get off at the stop ''Autostrada''. The road goes up the bridge and, technically, it's not the highway yet so you can can stand there with your thumb up without fearing the police.  Most the traffic is not going far at all so you'll likely only get to the first service station.\\n\\n=== [[Hitchhiking a boat|Ferrys]] ===\\n\\nGenova has a big ferry terminal. There are many ferries to [[Sardinia]], but even to [[Malta]], [[Corsica]], [[Barcelona]], [[Tunis]] and [[Tangier]].\\n\\n\\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\\n\\n[[trash:Genova]] [[nomad:Genova]]\\n\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|Italy}}\\n{{Category|City's}}\\n[[Category:Italy]]\\n[[Category:E25]]\",\n",

Bus stop \"Zuid\". Hitch at the road going to the motorway (). There is a 3 meters wide bike lane, so plenty of place to stop for the cars. Using a cardboard would be clever, as this entry of the motorway splits to different directions. Very good place to hitch towards any direction and there is a big bus station. (tram and bus: www.delijn.be, bus stop \"zuid\"). Scroll further for direction specific hitch hike spots.\\n\\n\\n* Option 2: Try getting a ride at the light [http://www.liftershalte.info/?lat=51.03653663169207&lng=3.7372398376464844&zoom=17&trip=24 here], all traffic has to stop so you have plenty of time to talk to people or show your sign off. You can also easily stand just behind the lights at the southside of the crossroads, there is ample place to stand safely, and for cars to stop on the emergency lane. The cars are also not yet driving very fast. Do use a sign though, as the onramp will give access to go to east towards Antwerpen, southeast towards Brussels, southwest towards Kortrijk, Lille and Paris and west towards Brugge, Oostende and Calais. But make sure you don\\'t make the mistake of trying to get there by getting on the ramp [http://www.liftershalte.info/?lat=51.042722811470185&lng=3.7326908111572266&zoom=17&trip=0 here]. It\\'s a lot longer than it looks and cars are going dangerously fast. You\\'ll end up having to jump from the bridge to the ground below. Many cars from the centre will take a bridge to the highway, for those option 1 is better. This option on the other hand gives access to the highway from the inner ringroad of Gent.\\n\\n=== Southwest towards [[Lille]], [[Paris]], [[Kortrijk]] ===\\n\\n\\n* Option 1: Go to the big roundabout “De Sterre” near the Sint Pieter station. There you can hitch the N60 towards “Oudenaarde” until you reach the motorway E 17 at Eke. \\n\\n\\n*Option 2: Take the train from Sint Pieter station for two stops to Eke-Nazareth. Blackriding is easy since it\\'s only two short stops on the train. Once there, walk north to a service station via Klapstraat. It\\'s a 20 minute walk but once there one should have no problems finding a ride as far as at least Paris, sometimes even southern France or Barcelona. There is plenty of local traffic heading to Kortrijk but avoid them because this is the other service stations on the E17 in Belgium are quite small.\\n\\n=== Northeast towards [[Antwerpen]] ===\\n\\n\\nTake the tram 4 in the city center towards Moscou and get off at A(dolf) van Ooteghemstraat, which is 1 stop before the tram reaches it\\'s end station. Walk left into the Walstraat and then the first street to the right into the de naeyerdreef (sand road with lot\\'s of trees). At the end of the road you\\'ll reach the entrance to the A14 (E17) where you can easily get a ride towards Antwerpen or Kortrijk. You can also take tram 2 towards Melle Leeuw and get off at Gentbrugge P&R. That is almost right on the spot where you can start hitchhiking. You can stand under the bridge if it is raining. There are two gas stations on the A14 (E17) before Antwerpen. \\n[[File:gent.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Ghent offers many cultural highlights.]]\\n\\n\\nTake tram number 2 or walk from the center it takes 30mins, when you arrive the tram station you will see the bridge which is highway E17 (A 14) goes to Antwerp. Walk through under the bridge follow the N9 motorway few minutes and you see the high way enter on the right hand side. There is a long gap that you can easily hitchhike. Take a cartoon written Antwerp\\n\\nAlternative with bus to reach the highway gas station:\\n(January 2023): Take bus 78 from for instance Gent - Dampoort to Lokeren Nieuwe Dreef and walk for about an hour (nearly 5 km) to the Total energies service station on E17. I haven\\'t tested this myself - It was particularly difficult to buy a ticket online from DeLijn, but according to Google maps and OSM it looks very possible.\\n\\n=== Northwest towards [[Brugge]], [[Oostende]] ===\\n\\nWalk or take the bus 18 to the \"Gent Malemstraat\" stop. The bus stop is a good place to show a sign \"Brugge\" or \"Oostende\". The road leads to the E40 motorway, actually to more directions than northwest too, but most of the cars take this exit of the city to go towards northwest.\\n\\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\\n\\n[[nomad:Gent]] [[trash:Gent]]\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|Oost-Vlaanderen}}\\n[[Category:Oost-Vlaanderen]]\\n\\n\\n[[de:Gent]]\\n[[fr:Gent]]',\n",

Walk out of the station over the bridge and turn right (north west) along the A80, continue to the roundabout with the big grassy \"pyramids\" where the [[M80 (GB)|M80]] joins the \\'\\'\\'A80\\'\\'\\'.

About 10 minutes after passing the Glasgow Botanical Gardens, there\\'s a BP petrol station on your left hand side. A lot of traffic from here will be heading out of the city and up the west of Scotland. Don\\'t get here too late, though, because a lot of the traffic is constituted by tourists. You can also use the petrol station as a lay-by and stand at the junction with traffic lights about 30 meters down the road.\\n\\nOr you can get a train from Glasgow Queen Street to Balloch (about 4 quid; it\\'s easy to get there for free if you show willingness to pay, but only have a quid or two). Come out of the station and turn right up the \\'\\'\\'A811\\'\\'\\' Lomond Road. You\\'ll come to a roundabout that joins with the \\'\\'\\'A82\\'\\'\\' - the main road heading north from here. Take a right at the roundabout and there\\'s a lay-by a little way up on the the left hand side.\\n\\n=== Direction South ([[England]], [[Liverpool]], [[London]],[[Peebles / Galashiels]]) ===\\n==== Option 1 ====\\nGet the bus 255 from the Buchanan bus station, and step off on Uddinston Road junction with Fallside Road just before Bothwell (next to a church).  Walk down Fallside Rd. until you get to the motorway and Uddingston services, quite busy with traffic heading South. The bus takes about an hour, and the walk 20 minutes, so it might be better to take the train to Uddingston (15min) and then do the 35min walk from there to the services. It\\'s best to hold a sign with the motorway number (AKA [[M74 (GB)|M74]], [[M6 (GB)|M6]]) or to approach drivers and ask. \\nThough being a very good option to get sure, fast and long distance lifts, be aware that the bus is very expensive! 4.75£, and difficult to blackride.\\n\\n==== Option 2 ====\\nIt is also, according to local hitchhikers, quite possible to hitch south by walking down N. Hannover St from Buchanan Bus Station, turn left at Cahedral St and then left again at Stirling St and walk until you get to the lights just before the motorway onramp, bear in mind that people go all different directions from here, west , east, south etc, so a sign and taking any lift going to Uddingston/Hamilton (where there are service areas) but being aware of shorter lifts might be a good idea, also if you try this option do come back and update this article.\\n\\nWill & Reed tried Option 2 in Oct. 2015 and had little luck. The bus lane is quite congested before the lights making it difficult to even see the cars as they make the turn.\\n\\n==== Option 3 ====\\nSo this option requires some back-tracking, but it seems like your best bet! Take the Megabus/900 Bus to Edinburgh (very easy to Blackride {see below] or just a couple of pounds) and ask the driver to let you out at the Harthill Services (the bus will pull off regardless but may not stop if you don\\'t tell the driver). From there, cross over the A1 on the bridge and wait at the service station. \\n\\n==== Option 4 ====\\nThe fourth option, which I tried and which may work for you, although I had no luck after waiting for 2,5 hours is the parking lane and the parking facility directly in front of the sliproad to the M74 [https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/House+of+Sher/@55.8524509,-4.2694017,18z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x3ff2a7b95b2c9cad!8m2!3d55.8525244!4d-4.2672122]. The place could be called ideal, as every traffic on your side of the road goes to the M74 in the right direction and there are often a lot of free spaces on the parking lane.

Here go on A7 and hitch hike to Galashiels . On this route there are cars which also head to Peebles.

There is an airport in Homiel, which is located 8 kilometers north-east from the city.\\n\\nIf you hitchhike within the city you will be expected to pay a small sum (up to $10 within the city). When you are on the highway, draw a sign in Russian and always specify you want to go for free. Belarus is rather safe country to travel in, but you must know at least some Russian.

It is like in the rest of the \"région\" a good area to hitchhike.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'CAREFUL (novembrer 2024) :\\'\\'\\' There have been changes in the bus numbers and itineraries since this non-up-to-date article has been written, take a moment to check!\\n\\nhttps://www.reso-m.fr/62-plans.htm\\n\\nhttps://www.reso-m.fr/7-itineraire.htm\\n\\n=== Direction: [[Torino]], [[Geneva|Geneve]], [[Chambery]] and [[Annecy]] (North, East) A41, A43 ===\\nTheir are two different techniques to go this direction.\\n*\\'\\'\\'First option:\\'\\'\\' the spot is a kind of a [[roundabout]], next to some traffic lights, right at the beginning of the A41, including traffic lights to ask. From the city center (bus stop \\'Victor Hugo\\' or \\'Chavant\\'), you can reach the place with the bus C1 direction \\'MEYLAN Maupertuis\\' and stop at \\'La Carronnerie Basse\\'. The ticket costs 1,5€ in a machine (at any tram stop) or 2€ on board.\\nJust before the stop, the bus leaves the highway so you have to walk back for some meters.\\nThere is not really any space to stop after the roundabout/traffic lights, sou you\\'ll have to ask people during the red light phase or wait with your thumb up. A very good option is to have a board written \"PEAGE\" (means \\'toll\\') on it, which is 30km further. A lot of cars go there and from the péage you will have no problem to continue on to Chambéry, Annecy, Genève, Torino, etc. Apparently, during the rush hours it is a really god spot!\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Free/blackriding option\\'\\'\\': walking to the spot from the city center should take you half an hour or more on a not very nice highway-side, or you could stand at the traffic lights on the beginning of the D1090, next to the big stadium (called the \\'Stade des Alpes\\' in the Parc Paul Mistral). You can as well blackride the tram B direction \\'GIERES Plaines des Sports\\', stop at \\'Grands Sablons\\'. Follow in the same direction the tram lines until you cross the bridge (your destination is on the left side of the bridge) and from there reach the petrol station. Then walk alongside the highway until the first red lights.\\n*\\'\\'\\'Second solution:\\'\\'\\' the gas station Total \"les Sablons\" on the D1090/Avenue de Verdun is about a kilometer before the first option. Follow the \\'free/blackriding option\\' instructions to get there, but you can pay the tram if you wish ;). A lot of people are not going very far but you can always get dropped at least to the next petrol station on the A41, before Brignoud, which is a really good spot to go further.\\nAt night, there are not so many cars passing trough the \"les Sablons\" gaz station.\\n\\n=== Direction: [[Valence]], [[Lyon]], [[Marseille]] (North, West, South) A48, A49, A43, A7 ===\\n\\nYou have to get to the spot that\\'s indicated in the map at the so called \\'Porte de France\\'. \\'\\'\\'From train station\\'\\'\\' you\\'ll have to take Avenue Félix Viallet (the street left of the one with the tram lines) till Cours Jean Jaurès with the tram lines E. Head left to the bridge (Pont de la porte de France), and once crossed you will see the entry of the highway. \\'\\'\\'From the city center\\'\\'\\' you have to reach the A/B/E tram stop \\'Alsace-Lorraine\\' and then take right to reach the same bridge mentioned before. You can either put yourself right next to the traffic lights asking people or simply waiting. Or you can walk 100m further; cross the tram lines and right after cars don\\'t drive fast and have room to stop.\\n\\nBoth are really good, but anyway a sure bet is to put a \"PEAGE\" sign (meaning \\'toll\\') which is only 10-15km further. Once there you can wait at the péage or there is even an petrol station just before, where you will get a lift towards Lyon/Valence for sure. Some cars might get out at the exit just before they have to pay but they will drop you at a roundabound (\"rond-point\") and from there you can take left and enter the petrol station area or a small road on the right for the péage.\\n\\nUpdate 2024: the petrol station works really well \\nIf you’re going further (like Paris etc.), you should get out the second petrol station before Lyon. It’s much bigger than the last. We’ve already made this mistake! \\n\\n\\n\\nThe split between the road to Lyon or Valence is just a bit after the péage so it can be good to make a board to indicate people where you are heading.\\n\\n=== Direction: Le Trièves, [[Gap]], [[Sisteron]], [[Marseille]] (South) A51, D1075 ===\\nThis direction brings you to the southern areas of Grenoble or to Marseille to the \\'nationale\\' road. Longer than highway, but nicer landscapes.\\n*\\'\\'\\'The easiest way\\'\\'\\' to get out of the city is to take either - bus number 25 direction \\'LE GUA Les Saillants\\' about 15min walking from the train station at the bus stop \\'Colonel Dumont\\' or at the bus/tram stop \\'Foch-Ferrié\\' - or you take the bus C14 at the main station \\'GARES\\' (ask to make sure where it stops, it has 2 endings). In both cases, stop at \\'La cime du bourg\\'. It\\'s about 20 kms from the city-center but it cost as much as all the other city buses, 1,5€ in a machine (at any tram stop) or 2€ on board. From the bus-stop, walk back 50 meters to the roundabout. It\\'s the perfect place to hitch-hike ([http://hitchwiki.org/maps/?zoom=11&lat=45.092067153356&lon=5.717356645508 see the spot on the map]). It usually work pretty well in that place so don\\'t go with the first car if it\\'s going only to the next village. Avoid the highway as this one is really expensive so people don\\'t take it.\\n*\\'\\'\\'The free way\\'\\'\\'. It is not as easy but you can avoid paying the bus by walking or blackriding the tram.\\nYou can walk from the city center to the \\'Pont de Catane\\' or take/blackride the tram C direction \\'SEYSSINS le Prisme\\' and stop at \\'Vallier Catane\\'. Continue walking in the same direction on the right side and just at the beginning of the bridge, there is a on ramp lane with red lights. From there cars can go both directions \\'Lyon/Valence\\' or the one you want so it is a good idea to make a sign or ask directly.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n{{IsIn|Rhône-Alpes}}\\n\\n[[Category:Rhône-Alpes]]\\n[[Category:France]]\\n\\n[[fr:Grenoble]]',\n",

However, not much traffic here goes east.

They treathened with a fine of 140 euros. To reach this spot, you have to walk next to the road, there is no pedestrian/ bike path, which makes it illegal to stand there.\\n\\nRuss also stood on the onramp of Europaweg and bergenweg. I do not suggest this spot on Sundays. I waited for almost two hours and maybe 30 cars were going on the highway. The police passed me twice but just smiled. Probably a great spot during the week. \\n\\nMarch 2022:[[User:Tzuiop9c|Tzuiop]] could not find the described place, there are building sites at the crossing.\\n\\nJuly 2022: Traffic heading east may be directed south via Europaweg to meet the N7, due to the construction. Clicks walked around the building site to the bus stop Lubeckweg on the Europaweg. (It seems like it’s no longer operating, which is good.) They managed to catch a ride east in under 30 minutes, using a sign. Signs may be useful since not all traffic here is heading east.\\n\\n==== Option 3: Esso Kolham, in Scharmer ====\\n{{Coords|53.1938|6.7014}}<br>\\nThere is a petrol station on the highway about 10km out of town which is easily accessible by bus (cost EUR 3,50). Take e.g. Line 5 until the final station, Goldbergweg. From there walk in the direction in which the bus is going and take the first road on the right to cross the highway. You can see the petrol station from the bridge. After the bridge turn right again and walk until you are almost past the petrol station. There is a small bridge consisting of roofing material made for the employees of the petrol station to cross the water.\\n\\n[[User:Tzuiop9c|Tzuiop]]: On a Wednesday I stood there from 11-12.00 and 16-18.00. There were very very few cars going to Germany. I suspect this will be different on the weekends.

There used to be a bus stop right after the crossing with traffic lights. Now it\\'s just a good spot for the cars to drive aside while going at low speed. The closest tram stop is the one at Hammarkullen on the way to Angered, number 8 (purple) goes there. If one wants to go by bus, then the stop is Eliebergsvägen, it\\'s right next to the spot. One can get there by taking 401 from Angered or 173 from Nils E-terminalen. [https://maps.google.se/maps?daddr=E45&hl=sv&sll=57.789252,12.017927&sspn=0.003243,0.010568&geocode=Fe_NcQMdK1i3AA&t=h&mra=ls&z=17 Here] is the spot on google maps.\\nThe spot is very good, just make sure the person that stops actually takes you out of Göteborg\\'s urban area, to avoid being stuck in places like Surte or Nödinge.\\n\\n=== Road E40 to [[Stockholm]]/Borås/Gbg Airport ===\\nThe fastest route by car to Stockholm is not via E20 as all the traffic signs say. Most people take this route instead. A good spot is bus stop Kallebäcksvägen [http://goo.gl/maps/V1ggx] (Take bus 50 there or a tram to Elisedal and walk five mins). The best spot to hitchhike is near the sign \"Jönköping\"(5 minutes walking from bus stop \"Kallebäcksvägen\"): that is the right direction to Stockholm. The same road will bring you to Borås and to Göteborg flygplatsen (airport). Note that in case a driver is just going to the airport, it is good to know that near the entry/exit of the airport there is a station service which is a good spot too (me and a friend successfully hitch-hiked from there to Uddebo, a small \"hippish\" village near Tranemo).\\n\\nFrom my experience, the Kallebäcksvägen spot did not work, we got stuck there for 5 hours (not a bad spot, just a lot of the traffic is local and people dont tend to stop in cities). We very successfuly hitched out of the Gbg Airport, there is a really great spot near the gas station.\\n\\n=== The \"slow road\" (E20) to [[Stockholm]] ===\\n\\nThe E20 is not a fast or big motorway, but an excellent route to truly see the Swedish countryside from.\\n\\n[http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=it&msa=0&msid=118215905716686756957.000448147f6ec7cb40744&ll=57.697921,11.996942&spn=0.003497,0.011759&z=17&iwloc=000448149457af71bfda2 This] (Broken link points to GPS coordinates 57.697921,11.996942) point may not look like much, but there is a lot of heavy traffic entering this on-ramp at all times. The reason why this exact spot works particularly well is because of a traffic light that naturally stops the vehicles that turn in here. If you stand just alongside where they\\'re turning in, they\\'ll have time to see you and pull out of line onto the tram tracks for a few seconds. Make sure to use a sign.\\n\\nA possibly better spot is Munkebäcksmotet (marked on map), a bus stop just before the onramp to the motorway. Either take bus number 513 or 515 in the direction  \\'\\'Polhemsplatsen\\'\\' (a ticket is 16,50 SEK (outdated price, it is now 20 or so SEK), but it is possible to blackride as well) or take the tram to \\'\\'Munkebäckstorget\\'\\' and walk north 10 minutes from there. Commuter trains to Alingsås also stop at Sävenäs right across the E20 (2 min walk) and might be the easiest blackride from the city centre. Most drivers are going only short distances, and the towns they go to are virtually impossible to hitchhike out of. Try to get to Alingsås, where the motorway ends and you can hitchhike directly on the roadside, there are very few good onramps between Göteborg and Alingsås. This option is probably better if you are going to a place near Göteborg, especially before Alingsås.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Malmö]],  [[Denmark]],  [[Germany]]  ===\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' Option 1 - Onramp in Kållered near IKEA\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nCatch the commuter train towards Kungsbacka to the stop \\'\\'\\'Kållered\\'\\'\\' (10 minutes), and as you get off the train walk under the traintracks and forward another 200 meters under the highway and then turn left past supermarkets, IKEA until you see a OKQ8 gasstation. \\nEither hitch at the gasstation itself or at the onramp on top of the hill. \\n\\nAny ride that will take you 10 km or further is good because that would get you to the gasstation \\'\\'\\'Sandsjöbacka\\'\\'\\' which is the best gasstation for almost a 100 km down this road.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2 If you want to hitch from town\\'\\'\\'  \\n\\nThe petrol station on the large crossing where the road Ullevigatan joins the E20 is just  a 10-15 minute walk from the central station. Some hitchhikers have reported great successes with this spot while others have waited very long times to get a ride.\\n\\nIt is near the big stadium Nya Ullevi and if you prefer it there is a busstop on the road outside of Nya Ullevi where people can pull over easily, however that spot only tends to be good with a good very visible sign so that people notice you actually hitchhiking.\\n\\n=== Ferries : West towards [[Denmark]] and also [[Germany]]  ===\\nThere are ferries going all the time to [[Denmark]] ([[Fredrikshavn]]) and [[Germany]] ([[Kiel]]) from the Stena Line terminal. Take tram 9, 3 or 11 to \\'\\'Masthuggstorget\\'\\' or just start from \"Järntorget\". From there walk towards the water and find the place where trucks and cars drive onto the ferries. Check-in starts 1.5 h before ferry departure, so be on time! (but drivers can still go in about 20 minutes before..). Have a sign with the country of destination on it. \\n\\nOn the ferry to Fredrikshavn, you have 3 hrs to find a ride, try to visit the truckers special area if you dont find any cars heading south, at least to the excellent hitching spot of Padburg, on the Danish/German border. \\n\\nHowever even being in a car on the way to Fredrikhavn you may have to pay a something like 6 euros for the ferry. Or possibly more if you enter as a foot passenger\\n\\nFor starting hitchhiking late and going to either places like [[Århus]] or [[Germany]] it can be quite amazing to catch one of the late ferries and end up in Germany even though leaving in the afternoon.\\n\\n=== Stena Line Ferries towards [[Kiel]] ===\\nFor the ferries towards Kiel, [[Germany]] the drivers don\\'t need to pay extra for you, but you have to book a cabin, which are available from 225 SEK upwards. The ferry is leaving every day at 19:00. If you hitchhike with a truckdriver you can get a special deal. The deal is basically that you pay approximately 250 SEK (an unknown editor of this page paid 253 a long time ago) and you get the following things included in the price.\\n* The crossing (710 SEK)\\n* Big all inclusive buffet (310 SEK)\\n* Big breakfast buffet (105 SEK)\\n* A small lunch-box to-go when you leave the ferry. (90 SEK)\\n* A cabin that is to be shared with your driver. \\nProbably a fairly luxurious cabin.(prices for the most basic ones start at 740 for a 2 bed-cabin ( there are no cabins with 1 bed)\\nAll in all you end up getting a 85-90% discount and a lot of superfluous luxury. \\nHowever it might be difficult too find a driver who let you go as his/her\\'s second driver.\\nYou could try to convince the drivers when they wait to board the ferry. They board the ferry about 1-2 hours before departure.\\n\\n\\n[[File:Stena_Germanica_in_G%C3%B6teborg.jpg|thumb|left|Ferry to Kiel]]\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n[[de:Göteborg]]\\n[[tr:Göteborg]]',\n",

After you hitchhiked out you can continue to the north through Yagur junction through the rural areas. This is also a good place to get to Route 6 from, due to its recent extension to Yokneam.

This problem does not apply to hitchhiking towards [[Nazareth]] on Road #75.\\n\\nTo go to Nazareth almost anyone is using Road #75. From Yagur junction is better to hitchhike north, on road #70.

Go inside the bus station though security, then take the tunnel that leads out to the train station square. Once you are in front of the train station, don\\'t go through security into the station, but go down the winding staircase on the side of the building, which goes to a tunnel leading under the tracks and out to the beach. Walk south along the beach for a few minutes, until you see the Microsoft building to your left. Then climb to the highway, walk a little to the south, and when you see a place where cars can stop, start thumbing.\\n\\nAnother place is to get off the bus/ride at the bottom of the winding Freud St, just on the opposite side of the Haifa shopping center, there is a small traffic light for car turning right going onto the fast road to Tel-Aviv (but most cars will get on the high way on the ramp a traffic light and a half earlier (opposite the Castra shopping mall).\\nHitching from Horev junction down to the beach shouldn\\'t be too hard, but it\\'s better to hold a sign if you do hitch from there as locals usually don\\'t (or blackride buses...).\\n\\n{{Cities Israel}}\\n[[Category:Israel]]',\n",

The [[Dominican Republic]] lies on the other side of the island. \\n\\n\"I hitched the southern half of the island for two months. I found hitching to be quite various depending on where you are. There is a highway leading from Port-Au-Prince to Petit-Goave to Aux Cayes that has lots of traffic including public transport, people will not understand what you are doing hitching and not trust you if they do understand you are looking for a ride. The road from Leogane to Jacmel is also similar to this though probably a bit more hitchable. On smaller roads people will understand what you are doing because of the lack of traffic and will often stop. Many roads have very little non-motorcycle traffic, I normally would start walking roads like this and only turning around to hitch if I heard a car, oft time people driving motorcycles would stop and give me free rides, a basic knowledge of French is important for this. Spanish is pretty common along the border and among adult males who have worked in Dominican Republic. English is relatively common among teenagers. If you already know some French then Creole is quite easy to learn, most words besides the basic connecting words are the same and the grammar is totally unrelated to French and much simpler and actually closer to English grammar. The phrase for hitching in Kreyol is Rue Libre, meaning free ride and is almost universally understood. The farther I got from the capital the easier hitching got, anywhere West or North-west of Aux Cayes the hitching was very easy. Police are rare and don\\'t bother you.\\n\\nOn main roads its probably best to take public transport. The best form of public transport is pick-up trucks known as \"tap-taps\" or sometimes \"camionettes\", just flag them down and discuss the price before going, a normal price is about 50 cents american between towns. There are also motorcycle taxis known as \"motos\", it\\'s one of the most common jobs in Haiti and competition is very fierce so they will often be practically begging for you to buy a ride. These moto taxis are normally prohibitively expensive (for me at least) but often they are the only available transport if you aren\\'t willing to walk. The price of these is for some reason cheaper on the far west side of the peninsula where the tap-tap prices are higher. The final option is the eighteen-wheelers which can be found on some routes. They are by far the cheapest way to get around and are quite easy to convince the drivers to take you for free. They transport cargo from village to village and stop extremely often to load or unload things at every village, a very slow but nice way to see the country. Sometimes it\\'s acceptable to just jump on one of these trucks as it\\'s passing by and ask someone when you get on to it if you have to pay or not.\\n\\nSome things to know about Haitian culture is that it\\'s a very frivolous culture in which people are constantly buying things they can\\'t afford, begging for things and giving away things. As a foreigner you will be constantly asked for money or food, it is rude to say no but telling people possibly another time will normally satisfy them. The phrase for \"I am hungry\" is \"M Grangou\", and many people especially along the Dominican border are hungry much more often then they are full. Getting invited to people\\'s houses to sleep, especially when people realize you would instead be sleeping outside is generally quite common. Most people who invite you to their house are people who have meet foreigners before such as people who have worked with NGOs or sailors. When in someone\\'s home they will often give you all that they can down to their last coin and people without anything will often ask politely if you can buy food for yourself or them. Haitian culture is extremely status based and people will judge you quickly. They are extremely confused by travelers in their country, and may believe you are in an NGO, the CIA or are just literally insane even if you tell them otherwise. Outside of the capital violent crime is extremely rare but thievery is quite possible. I\\'ve had people go through my things to see if I had anything of value and let go when I told them I was crazy and they didn\\'t find anything. I\\'ve also had people want to see what is in my bag quite angrily and who would have tried something I\\'m sure if they weren\\'t in the public eye. This makes the back roads the most dangerous places outside the capital, not that it seems so, it just takes someone fed-up with their situation and pushed to the point where they don\\'t care about consequences. The North side of the island which I haven\\'t visited is according the stereotypes of the people I meet more \"civilized\", richer and more money-oriented, has better roads, less sharing, less beautiful, more dangerous, and more \"historical\" than the South. -JRG\"\\n\\n{{IsIn|Caribbean}}\\n\\n[[User:Jackfang]] I had a great time hitchhiking across Haiti as \"the Chinaman\", in Feburary 2016.  I went across most major cities by hanging at the back of Camionettes. Being able to speak French, it was somewhat easy to find people who speak some French. It was hard for me to understand Haitian Creole. Most people were very welcoming. Many people asked for money.

You get there by taking tram #1 in direction of ''Frohe Zukunft'' and getting out at the stop ''Äußere Hordorfer Straße''. The gas station is on your left after the traffic light. You can also take an S-Bahn from the central station and get out at ''S-Bhf Dessauer Brücke'', then you need go up the stairs, cross the street and walk right a few meters. \\nYou can also walk here, from the center it is only about 20-25minutes. Just walk in direction of ''Wasserturm'' and then follow the big road/signs to the highway. \\n\\nIt is quite easy to find lifts towards Berlin and Leipzig and South onto the A9. It can take a while (even an hour or more) to find a lift to Magdeburg or even onto the A14 in that direction. Also, maybe 80-90% of the cars is just local traffic. \\n\\nYou can also hitchhike at the road passing by the gas station: the right lane will turn after the bridge at the traffic light in direction of the highway (on the Bundestraße B100). There is no good place to stop though (and probably few cars towards Magdeburg). \\n\\n\\nIf you can't find anybody who goes directly in your direction, you can ask anybody who drives on the B100 towards the A14. Directly before the exit to the highway there is another Aral gas station on the right side and also a McDonalds. \\n\\nThe B100 continues to the A9, so if you want to hitchhike to Berlin you can also get out at the next traffic light after, there is place to stop and the red light is long enough to ask people directly. \\n\\n=== North towards [[Magdeburg]] ===\\nThe easiest way to get to / direction of Magdeburg is Option 1. [[User:Halmd|Halmd]] never waits longer than 20 minutes there. On weekdays there is a lot of traffic until 09:00, after that it is hard to get a ride until 14:00. After 14:00 you can again easily get a lift. \\n\\nDrivers can go via the exits ''Trotha'', ''Tornau'' or the Bundestraße B100. \\n\\n==== Option 1 ====\\nTake tram #3, #8 or #12 to the last stop ''Trotha''. Go back to the traffic light where the tram turned and walk 500m along Trothaer Straße (later Magdeburger Chaussee) until you reach an Aral station. Try hitching at the station or stand by the road. It is better to stand by the road. After the Aral station there is a shoulder, which is not tarmaced but still good to stop. Try to get a lift on the Autobahn, as cars further up drive pretty fast. The service station ''Plötzetal'' is very close, it is after the next exit ''Löbejün''. If your driver goes to Könnern ask them to go via the highway and drop you at the service station. \\n\\n==== Option 2 ====\\nTake the tram #1 to the last stop ''Frohe Zukunft'' and hitch directly at the road with a sign. Especially locals will avoid the longer route via the B100 and drive this way towards the on-ramp ''Tornau'', but also some navigation systems lead you this way. You can accept a lift to the on-ramp, although there is no shoulder to stop.\\n\\n\\n[[User:N0id|n0id]] once got a direct lift after 10 minutes to Magdeburg at the spot in Frohe Zukunft, but a second time proved to be as bad as the Aral station near Wasserturm where it took usually one hour or more. Although he tried it only once, the first option might be the best.\\n\\n=== West towards [[Göttingen]], [[Kassel]] {{Ade|38}} ===\\nMany trams go to the stop ''Rennbahnkreuz''. Here, the B80 begins, which leads to the [[A143_(Germany)|A143]], leading in turn to the ''A38''. It might be possible to catch lifts towards Leipzig and towards [[Göttingen]] or [[Kassel]], but there is no real place to stand, just a traffic light (after the bridge) where cars towards Leipzig turn left and all others go straight. \\n\\n=== East to [[Leipzig]] ===\\n====Option 1====\\nThe gas station at ''Wasserturm'' is a good spot for catching rides to Leipzig (see above under [[Halle (Saale)#All_Directions_.2F_North_towards_Berlin:_A9_North|All Directions]]).\\n\\n====Option 2====\\nAnother option starting further south in the city is the ''B6'' National Road: From the main station, walk along ''Raffinieriestraße'', which turns into ''Leipziger Chaussee''. You will very quickly reach the outskirts of the city, where you can start hitching from numerous spots.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Nürnberg]], [[München]] {{Ade|9}} ===\\nThe service station (Autohof) at [[A9_(Germany)|A9]]-exit No. 16 (''Großkugel'') is a good spot for catching long rides going south. \\n\\nYou will reach the service area by hitching along the ''B6'' towards Leipzig for approximately 18km (see abover under [[Halle (Saale)#East_to_Leipzig|East to Leipzig]]).\\n\\nAnother option is to take the S3 train from Halle main station to ''Schkeuditz West''. From there it's a one minute walk to the service area.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking in ==\\n=== From [[Berlin]] {{Ade|9}} ===\\nThe last service station on the A9, [[Köckern West]], is located just 5km before the exit towards Halle. It is not recommended to get off in Köckern because people going to Halle will usually not stop here, their destination being only 20km away. Instead, ask your driver to take the exit towards Halle and drop you off on the B100. This means a small detour, as the first possibility to turn back towards the Autobahn is a 3km drive from the exit. <br> \\nIn [[User:Mohit|Mohit]]'s experience, hitching Berlin-Halle regularly, drivers will gladly do you the favour and no one has ever refused. It is best to ask before it's too late to commence plan B, though. (which should be to find a different driver at Rasthof Fläming or Köckern, or get off at the airport, in [[Leipzig]], or on the B6 and hitch from there)<br>\\nOnce you're on the B100, there will be lots of traffic with almost everybody going to Halle. You can either hitch the old-fashioned way (thumbing), or ask people at the traffic light or at the gas station 1km down the road.\\n\\n===  From the North {{Ade|14}} ===\\nYou can get off at ''Tornau''. It is still far to the center, but you can easily hitch another ride during daytime. \\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n{{Category|City's}}\\n[[Category:Saxony-Anhalt]]\\n[[de:Halle (Saale)]]\\n{{IsIn|Saxony-Anhalt}}\",\n",

As you approach Hamburg, traffic slows significantly due to urban congestion and ongoing roadworks. Getting dropped closer to the city might result in longer travel times and fewer convenient connections to onward destinations. Many drivers tend to switch to the A1 or even avoid Hamburg at all before reaching Hamburg due to frequent traffic jams and construction in the Elbe Tunnel area on the A7. Here are some additional details based on common scenarios:\\n\\n=== Recommended Drop-off Points: ===\\n- \\'\\'\\'Stillhorn Service Station (A1\\'\\'\\'): If you’re dropped here, you can (cross to the other side), walk to the bus stop Kirchdorf (Süd) and take a bus to S-Bahn Wilhelmsburg, which connects directly to the city.  \\n- Another option when coming from the A1 is to leave at Highway Exit 38 (HH-Harburg). From there it\\'s about 2.5 km to S-Bahn Harburg, though a bus connection is available as well (or you could ask you driver to drop you at S-Bahn Harburg). It is a bigger train station and there are urban railway connections (S-Bahn), local and regional trains aswell as express trains. \\n- \\'\\'\\'Harburger Berge Service Station (A7)\\'\\'\\': From here, walk to the nearby bus stop **Haithabusweg**. Take a bus to **S-Bahn Harburg**.\\n\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n=== East towards [[berlin]] {{Autobahn|24}}===\\nThe fastest way to go to Berlin (2024) is on highway 24, to get on it you can take the bus to the bus stop called BAB-Auffahrt Horn which is right next to the roundabout which takes you onto the highway. You can either stand by the bus stop before the roundabout or you can go onto the highway right by the roundabout. It might be a bit risky because police might tell you to move, but can be worth it. User @baltaback got a ride straight to Berlin here after police told him to move. Otherwise the bus stop is a good option. Highway 24 seems to be the best and fastest way to go to Berlin 2024.\\n\\n=== Northeast towards [[Lübeck]], [[Puttgarden]] {{Autobahn|1}} (& East towards [[Berlin]] {{Autobahn|24}}) ===\\n==== Option 1: Serways Raststätte Stillhorn Ost ====\\nTake S-bahn S3 or S31 to \\'\\'Wilhelmsburg\\'\\' and then bus 13 to the last stop at \\'\\'Kirchdorf-Süd\\'\\'. Walk east along Karl-Arnold-Ring for 200 m. Keep walking straight and cross over the small bridge. Turn \\'\\'\\'right\\'\\'\\' after the bridge on Altenfelder Weg and walk for ≈500 m to the junction with Stillhorner Weg. If you look around here you will see an underpass, go under the autobahn and walk for 400 m until a small road to your left (Jakobsberg) just after the on-ramp. Walk 300 m north along this path and you will reach the back of the Raststätte.\\n\\nEven though technically possible, it is not advisable to try and go East from here. It is however possible to catch a ride downtown towards Horner Kreisel from here.\\n\\n==== Option 2: Horner Kreisel ====\\nFollow the directions as for Berlin below. Use a sign.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Hannover]] {{Autobahn|7}} & Southwest towards [[Bremen]] {{Autobahn|1}} ===\\nTake S-bahn S3 or S31 to \\'\\'Wilhelmsburg\\'\\' and then bus 13 to the last stop at \\'\\'Kirchdorf-Süd\\'\\' (max. ten minute trip). Walk east along Karl-Arnold-Ring for 200 m. Keep walking straight and cross over the small bridge. Turn \\'\\'\\'left\\'\\'\\' and walk 100 m to the parking lot of Raststätte Stillhorn. \\n\\nIf you are going towards the [[Netherlands]], get a ride south to \\'\\'Dammer Berge\\'\\' on the A1 (just before [[Osnabrück]]), where the [[A1 (Germany)|A1]] joins the [[A30 (Germany)|A30]] in the direction of [[Rheine]] and [[Amsterdam]].\\n\\n=== South towards [[Lüneburg]] {{Autobahn|39}} ===\\nTowards Lunenburg the service station described above (Raststätte Stillhorn) is not recommended. Instead, take the metro or the S-Bahn to \"Berliner Tor\", take exit B and walk along the national road B75 to the crossing Heidenkampsweg-Nordkanalstr/Ankelmannsplatz. You can start thumbing at the traffic light (the cars towards Lunenburg go straight). You can find a safer option below. \\n\\n=== Another Option towards the A1: East towards [[Berlin]] {{Autobahn|24}} & (Northeast towards [[Lübeck]], {{Autobahn|1}}), South towards [[Lüneburg]] {{Autobahn|39}}, [[Hannover]] {{Autobahn|7}} & Southwest towards [[Bremen]] {{Autobahn|1}} ===\\nThere\\'s a lot of traffic passing through Harburg (in the south of Hamburg). It is pretty well reachable via S3/S5 or regional trains from the central station. Leave at \"Harburg\" and take a bus (349 \"Bhf Harburg\" or 152 \"Breslauer Straße\") to the bus stop \"Neuländer Weg\". On week days both bus lines operate every 20 minutes and the ride will take 7-9 mins. From the bus stop, you follow the \"Neuländer Straße\" for 1,0 km in the direction the bus is driving. There is an onramp on the A1 with a nice and safe roundabout (which makes it my favorite spot in Hamburg whenever I want to get on the A1), where you can start thumbing. Even though it might take you longer to get to the spot, depending on where in Hamburg you\\'re starting, in my experience it is way faster and more reliable than \"Raststätte Stillhorn\", that is described above. \\n\\n\\n=== North towards [[Flensburg]], [[Kiel]], [[Denmark]] {{Autobahn|7}} ===\\n==== Option 1: Autobahn Junction HH-Schnelsen ====\\nTake U-bahn \\'\\'U2\\'\\' towards \\'\\'Niendorf-Markt\\'\\'. From there get out and ask people for the bus station (\\'\\'Busbahnhof\\'\\'). Take bus 5 or bus 191 and get off at \\'\\'Freizeitbad Bondenwald\\'\\'. This is a bus stop with a bus bay and here all the traffic to the motorway passes by.\\n\\n==== Option 2: Raststätte Holmoor ====\\n\\nTake S-Bahn S3 or S21 to \\'\\'Eidelstadt\\'\\', and then A1 to \\'\\'Quickborn\\'\\'. It is possible to blackride. Then take bus 594 in direction of \\'\\'U A Norderstedt Mitte\\'\\' and get off after the bus goes over the motorway (\\'\\'Hasloher Weg\\'\\' stop). After getting off the bus, walk in the direction back towards the bridge (west) and you will immediately see a small road going left (Hasloher Weg). You will feel you are lost in the country side because after 200 m, this way doesn\\'t look like a street anymore. Never mind, keep going straight for another 400 m and on your right you will see the petrol station. We needed less than five minues to find a driver to Denmark\\n\\n[[File:Leaving Hamburg direction Puttgarden.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Hitching on Horner Kreisel - illegal version!]]\\n\\n[[File:Hamburg-Berlin.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Hitching on busstop \"Caspar-Voght-Straße\" - legal version!]]\\n\\n[[File:Hornerbus.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Hitching spot busstop \"BAB Auffahrt Horn\"]]\\n\\nIf you\\'re planning to hitchhike towards [[Berlin]] on the [[A24 (Germany)|A24]], there\\'s a bus stop near a big [[roundabout]] in the southeast of the city where it\\'s possible to catch a ride directly to Berlin or at least part of the way. This spot is called the \\'\\'Horner Kreisel\\'\\' and is a popular hitchhiking spot for many hitchhikers in [[Germany]]. Here you can stand and wait for a ride. This works fine. For hitchhiking to Berlin prepare a cardboard sign with a huge B written on it, which is the number plate sign for cars from Berlin and understood widely. It\\'s a good spot.\\n\\nThe easiest way to get there is from the Station \\'\\'Hasselbrook\\'\\' (S1, S11). You leave the train in the direction of Steindamm, upstairs turn right and the after a few meters left into the Caspar-Voght-Straße. Follow this street 500 meters until the big crossing with Sievekingsallee. On the opposite side of the Sievekingsallee you\\'ll see the bus-stop \\'\\'Caspar-Voght-Straße\\'\\'. Ask for the road to Berlin if you are lost. Go further up the road and look for a bus stop with a large blue metal pole in front with lots of hitch-hiker traces :). It\\'s just in front of the \"Horner Kreisel\" and is called \"BAB Auffahrt Horn\". You can also reach there by taking the U2 or U4 to \"Rauhes Haus\". This spot is actually great, because owners of Turkish shop at the station noticed strange amounts of hitchhikers in front of their business. I think they are quite enjoying it. Just when I was about to start, they invited me in for a free Turkish coffee and cigarette (I usually don\\'t smoke, but this was kind of nice). They got some carton boxes and marker just for assisting hitchhikers, so they made one for me. Highly recommended (although it was two years ago, so I just hope they are still there).\\n\\nPlease note, some years ago they reconstructed the Horner Kreisel. Earlier it was possible to stand in the middle of it on an bus stop, but now the bus stop is located \\'\\'\\'before\\'\\'\\' the roundabout where the cars are driving pretty fast, and on the Kreisel the cars have no opportunity to stop.\\n\\nSome hitchhikers claim that hitching on the roundabout turn-off direction Berlin is easier, as here you have much more traffic going your way. It\\'s recommended to stand immediately after the roundabout, in the grass before the blue motorway sign. Cars can stop right after the motorway sign. This place is used by many hitchhikers. It\\'s not uncommon to find a direct lift to Berlin in 5 minutes. But it has to be pointed out that doing so is against the law, for the Autobahn starts there − and you must not walk or stop on it. Hitchhikers and drivers, who stop there, can be fined. Apart form the legal aspect, bear in mind that this may be dangerous for you! \\n\\n\\nIf you want to go to Puttgarden for going into [[Scandinavia]], you can hitch to the ferry at [[Puttgarden]], and get a ride straight to [[Copenhagen]].\\n\\n=== Northeast towards [[Lübeck]], [[Puttgarden]] {{Autobahn|1}} ===\\n\\n== Sleeping out & Tips ==\\nEventhough theres a lot of parks and hidden spots in town where you can camp or simply sleep the night off in the ground, I would recommend to go to Hauptbanhof (central train station) and catch the regional train that goes towards [https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1237025548#map=15/53.4034/10.0663 Maschen Train Station] (not to be confused with the nearby village as you would be directed to take buses on a more complex route). The deal with Maschen is that its the second largest Freight Train Yard in the world (and only by a few tracks not the first one), its quite a sight and a great place to hang out specially if you appreciate freight trains and large infrastructures. Theres a ton of spots to camp right by the yard but I would suggest to find your way to one of the 4 lakes that you can find right next to it.  [https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?whereami=1&query=53.3942%2C10.0635#map=16/53.3942/10.0635 See im Mascher Moor] should be your best bet but beware that its the most popular one so you might wake up with a lot of people walking by (but camping is ok as people do it all the time, specially on fishing trips). Take a moment to walk up the bridge crossing the yard and take that marvelous sight. Notice that the Bridge is under constraction (as of May 2021) so you cant walk easily from one side to the other (but you can if you can crawl under that fence or jump thru the sides). My second recommendation is [https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?whereami=1&query=53.4191%2C10.0478#map=16/53.4191/10.0478 See im Grossen Moor] which I found more peaceful in terms of people but a bit noisy due to proximity to a highway. There are portable toilets on the way to the sandy beach and you should find enough spots right by the water to camp. To go there its a better idea to jump out from the train at Meckenfeld train station as its a much shorter walk than from Maschen Passenger Station.\\nIf you happen to be caught on a storm or something, theres the [https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?whereami=1&query=53.41199%2C10.05329#map=18/53.41199/10.05329 creepy tunnel] that goes all the way under the freight yard where you would be safe from rain and winds but maybe not from dracula. If for whatever reason you dont wanna take this route or the bridge in order to cross the yard and you take on the stupid idea of walk thru the tracks, beware that this is a freight yard where trains are assembled and dissasembled, which means that theres a lot of silent killer-wagons being released into the tracks, no lights and no sounds. Just silently ghosting their way thru the yard and if one of those heavy tons of steel should hit you that would be it for you. Then theres the tracks where the fast trains show up in a split second. So my advice, no walking thru the tracks unless you have eyes and ears all around your head and know how to use them.\\n\\n== Public transport== \\nNotice how there seem to be no ticket inspectors at all in Hamburg, Ive been on and off in that town in the years 2018,2019,2020 and 2021 and taken countless rides on buses, sbahns, ubahns and regional trains going in and out of the city and never been asked for a ticket.\\nSometimes there are large-scale ticket inspection operations. It has happened to me after getting out of the metro at the main station and at the S-Bahn station Veddel (after getting out of the S-Bahn aswell as after getting out of the bus line 13!). Usually they form a line and wait after the stairs, so if you take care and you notice them, you can just turn around, find a way to get out of the station without using an official exit or just get off at the next station. \\n\\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|Germany}}\\n__NOTOC__\\n\\n[[Category:Germany]]\\n[[Category:E45]]\\n[[Category:E26]]\\n[[Category:E22]]\\n[[Category:Route Amsterdam - Copenhagen]]\\n\\n[[de:Hamburg]]\\n[[fr:Hamburg]]',\n",

Hamm might be a good place for you to head for if you want to hitch out of the Ruhr Area as this is the last city in Eastern direction and you will find a long distance lift more easy.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Berlin]] ===\\n\\nFrom the main train station as well as from the city center you can take bus \\'\\'\\'R41\\'\\'\\', \\'\\'\\'21\\'\\'\\' or \\'\\'\\'22\\'\\'\\' to the stop \"Rhynern Mitte\". The busses go along Werler Strasse, over a bridge on the end of Hamm-Mitte and turn left into a suburb of Hamm, and the ride will cost you outrageous 2,30 Euro (bus R41 turns left a little bit further, not directly after the bridge). With 21, 22 you can go one stop further, the next one after \"Rhynern-Mitte\" is \"Dohmwirthhof\". From the stop walk along the \"Reginenstrasse\", you\\'ll see Aldi on the right side of the road, just follow the street further for 5 - 10 minutes, depends how much you hurry and you will arrive on a bridge over the motorway. After the bridge turn left (\"Im Zengerott\") and you walk to the petrol station \"Rhynern Süd\". There is a fast food restaurant, a big parking spot and a huge traffic. Finding a lift to the direction of Hannover/Berlin/Poland is no problem at all. \\nIt might be possible to wait for a direct lift to Berlin, especially if you speak Polish, as there are a lot of Polish drivers on the road, but as there are also different medium sized cities on the way, it is more convenient to make stops on other petrol stations, f.e. nearby Hannover.\\n\\n=== West towards [[Netherlands]] ===\\n\\nFollow the advice from above and head for the petrol station in Rhynern. To go to the other side in West direction, you should not cross the bridge, but follow the \"Reginenstrasse\", until you can go to \"Ostendorfstrasse\". Follow the road and a small path will bring you to the patrol station.\\nBut be aware! This is the entrance gate to the Ruhr Area with an endless number of different cities. You can can lost there very fast, so if you want to go further than this area, only take lifts that drop you off AFTER the Ruhr Area.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Bremen]], [[Hamburg]] ===\\n\\nMight be possible to get a lift on the petrol station Rhynern (west direction), as the next crossing is with A1, and some cars must change motorways there.\\nAnother option is to go to the west of the city, motorway exit 81-Hamm/Bergkamen. Out of the city there leads Dortmunder Strasse. It is not that simple to get there with a public transport. You should get somehow to the bus stop \"Quellenstrasse\", from there every hour goes fast bus S30 (direction Dormund), you should get out on \"Eckernkamp\", the trip goes on for 6 minutes, but the distance is pretty long, wouldn\\'t recommend to walk. Checking the bus schedule is possible here http://www.stadtwerke-hamm.de/metanavigation/fahrplanauskunft/.\\nThere you can stand with or even without a sign, lots of slow traffic, enough space to stand on the hard shoulder, easy for cars to stop. The easiest lift is to the next gus station in Münster. Be careful that driver exits the motorway in Münster-Nord, not in Münster-Süd, as the petrol station is in between. But many cars drive further north as well.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|North-Rhine Westphalia}}\\n[[Category:Germany]]',\n",

On both motorways, there is a big service area, that are easily reachable by tram.<br />\\n\\nIt\\'s also a nice place to stay, for a day or two, with a beautiful old town center, many parks, lakes and forests, and a lot of pubs and nightclubs.\\n\\nPublic transport is very good and tickets are checked very rarely. For the airport, check [[Hannover-Langenhagen Airport]].\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== West towards [[Dortmund]], [[Amsterdam]] {{Autobahn|2}} ===\\nTake a tram to \\'\\'Königsworther Platz\\'\\'. There is a wide road called \\'\\'Bremer Damm\\'\\', which leads to the motorway. There is only little space to pull over and most of the traffic is local, but at least during rush hours this works fine. At other times, it\\'s probably faster to take the tram to \\'\\'Garbsen\\'\\', see below.\\nIt helps a lot to use a sign saying \"A2 - WEST\". Try to get a ride at least to \\'\\'Garbsen\\'\\', just outside of \\'\\'\\'Hannover.\\'\\'\\' There is a huge service area.\\n=== East towards [[Berlin]] or West towards [[Dortmund]], [[Amsterdam]] {{Autobahn|2}} ===\\nFrom the city center (\\'\\'Kröpke\\'\\') take the tram #U4 to \\'\\'Garbsen\\'\\' (the last station). There switch over to bus #126 towards \\'\\'Altgarbsen/Am Blauen See\\'\\'. The last bus stop is located directly in front of the service station [[Garbsen Süd]]. From the central station, the ticket is EUR 2,90 and it will take about 30 to 40 minutes. There is a lot of traffic, you won\\'t have to wait long. If you need to go westwards, just walk right, follow the road for 400m, walk down under the bridge and you\\'ll see the service station [[Garbsen Nord]] on the other side.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Hamburg]], [[Bremen]] or South towards [[Göttingen]], [[Kassel]], [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] {{Autobahn|7}} ===\\nTake the tram #6 direction \\'\\'Messe/Ost\\'\\' and get off at \\'\\'Kronsberg\\'\\'. Turn left into \\'\\'Wülferoder Straße\\'\\'. After ~100 m, the road will head right, but there will be a little path straight on. Follow this path for ca. 1 km, about 30 minutes, it leads directly to the service area \\'\\'Wülferode\\'\\' on the [[A7 (Germany)|A7]].\\nThe tram ticket is EUR 2,30 .\\n\\n=== North towards [[Hamburg]], [[Bremen]] {{Autobahn|7}} ===\\nFor this option you haven\\'t to walk so much and you are get there very easy by tram.\\n\\nGet with the tram to \"Alter Flughafen\" from there follow the road north. There are plenty of spots a long the street where cars could stop easily and even a petrol station where you could ask directly. I and my girlfriend stayed with a sign HH (Hamburg) just 5 minutes and got a ride to the petrol station \"Allertal\" at the A7. From there it is super easy to go to Hamburg.\\n\\n== Hitching In ==\\n=== Coming via [[A2 (Germany)|A2]] ===\\nTrams in both options cost EUR 2,70 (2 zones), but if you don\\'t mind buying a ticket for only 1 zone, it\\'s EUR 2,30.\\n\\n\\'\\'Option 1:\\'\\' Get off at \\'\\'Hannover-Herrenhausen\\'\\'. There is a tram station close to the motorway, where you can get into the town center in 15 minutes\\n\\n\\'\\'Option 2:\\'\\' Get off at \\'\\'Hannover/Langenhagen\\'\\'. Here you can find a tram station directly next to the ramp towards the motorway. Drivers can drop you out directly in front of the tram station, where they also find traffic lights, a small petrol station and the possibility to turn around towards the motorway. Detour for the driver: Maybe 500m. Here tram #1 brings you all the way to the \\'\\'Hauptbahnhof\\'\\' in ~ 10 minutes.\\n\\n=== Coming via [[A7 (Germany)|A7]] ===\\nYou can ask the driver, if he wants to take little detour over the [[A37 (Germany)|A37]]. This will be 12 km more and he will lose about 10 minutes. If he doesn\\'t want that, tell him to drop you at the service area \\'\\'Wülferode\\'\\'.

Luckily, this isn't the case for the direction Zwolle/Ommen/Almelo.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== South towards [[Almelo]] and [[Tubbergen]] / [[Oldenzaal]] ===\\n====Option 1====\\nGo down to the roundabout at the {{Nnl|343}} ''Twenteweg'' and try there. There is no hard shoulder for vehicles to pull over, actually, the entire N343 up here is very hitchhiker-unfriendly as a matter of fact, but at least here you get all the traffic out of town, and it's going slow enough to be able to stop. Another possibility is to catch bus 80 down to [[Kloosterhaar]], 10 kilometres south of Hardenberg, where the road to Tubbergen / Oldenzaal and Almelo split. At least the N343 down to Oldenzaal has better shoulders here, and most traffic goes at least to Tubbergen.\\n\\n====Option 2, Untested alternative====\\n{{Coords|52.5726|6.6052}}<br>\\nThere seems to be a small parking bay with a city map.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Coevorden]] and [[Emmen]] ===\\n{{Coords|52.5748|6.6018}} Onramp.<br>\\n{{Coords|52.5797|6.6132}} Parking bay<br>\\nWalk down the ''Haardijk'' to the ramp of the {{Nnl|34}}. Again, no hard shoulder, but you're very visible and most traffic will go at least up to [[Coevorden]]. You can also walk along the shoulder to a parking place about a kilometre down if you wish to catch all traffic on the road, but I would advise against it, because the parking place is small, and the traffic goes by fast. It will not necessarily lead to better pick-up times.\\n\\n=== West towards [[Zwolle]] and [[Ommen]] / South towards [[Almelo]] ===\\n{{Coords|52.5743|6.5964}}<br>\\nFollow the ''Haardijk'' past the on-ramp in the direction of Emmen and the viaduct over the {{Nnl|34}}. Take the first left at the traffic lights and cross the road once on the ''Koningsspil''. You'll find yourself at an amazing hitchhiking spot: very long emergency/parking lane, long enough for trucks to stop, right on the road heading to the on-ramp. (Almost) all drivers heading from Hardenberg to Ommen / Zwolle will be able to see you and will have enough time to decide whether they want to pick you up. Note: this spot should also work for Almelo, but some (most?) drivers take the {{Nnl|343}} and only get on the {{Nnl|36}} at [[Mariënberg]]. Since the reconstruction of the N34, it makes very little sense to accept a ride to ''De Witte Paal'' (the roundabout connecting the N34 and the N36), because of an absolute lack of suitable hitchhiking spots between Hardenberg and the intersection.

There is a feeder road to the A5, starting right in the town center, which makes it some kind of \\'town exit\\' - Many cars leaving the city for the motorway will pass by. To get there from the train station, just walk into \\'\\'Gneisenaustr.\\'\\' in west direction for like 200m.\\n\\n=== Direction South {{Autobahn|5}} ===\\nFollow \\'\\'Ringstraße\\'\\' in direction to [[Speyer]]. After crossing the rail-tracks and walking through a bridge you\\'ll see a petrol station where you can talk to drivers directly, furthermore there is plenty of space for cars to stop. Note that all the cars go south here! You can also ask people just to drop you off at Raststätte [[Hardtwald West]], 5 km south on the motorway.\\n\\nRaststätte \"Hardtwald\" is a good place for north and south. Some 200 meters north of the place there\\'s a tunnel under the highway, making it possible to change to the other side. You can reach the petrol station by public transport: Take a \"S-Bahn\" (suburban train, blackrideable) to St. Ilgen/Sandhausen and from there Bus 725 to \"Lebenshilfe\", the second leg can also be done by foot (exactly 2.9km from the S-Bahn stop to Hardtwald) and you\\'ll pass a REWE with diveable dumpsters. From the \"Lebenshilfe\" stop it\\'s five to ten minutes if you don\\'t turn into the nature protection area on the left. \\n\\nAnother way to get to the rest area via public transit/walking rather than waiting for a ride to it: take public transit (Stadt-Bahn or bus) to the Kirchheim neighborhood at the south end of Heidelberg, and walk Southwest through the public country roads which are mostly used by cyclists and farmers. The walk is around an hour from the center of Kirchheim. You can probably get a ride in under an hour from the above mentioned petrol station but I prefer the walk because it guarantees that I will be starting already on the Autobahn.\\n\\n[http://maps.google.de/maps?f=q&hl=de&time=&date=&ttype=&q=Ringstra%C3%9Fe,+69115+Heidelberg,+Heidelberg,+Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg,+Deutschland&sll=51.124213,10.546875&sspn=11.539375,29.355469&ie=UTF8&cd=1&geocode=0,49.403642,8.682076&ll=49.402037,8.678856&spn=0.023347,0.057335&z=14&om=1 Petrol station on google maps]\\n\\n== Personal Experience ==\\n\\n\\'\\'I had a hard time getting out of Heidelberg, after one of the most successful days of hitchhiking going from Berlin to Heidelberg in one afternoon.

Stop cars in front of the ferry terminal before they enter the ferry.

The crossing right before the motorway was found to be a not so good spot . There is a petrol station and the bus stop ''Älvsborgsgatan''. At the bus stop before (''Juelsgatan'') you probably have the same, not optimal chances bacause cars are already going fast. Another possibility is the crossing with traffic lights second to the last before the motorway close to ''Stattena'' (a small square). \\n\\nTo get to these places from the centre you have to follow ''Järnvägsgatan'', which turns into ''Drottninggatan'' and later into ''Hälsovägen'' after it turns right and goes uphill.

Then, go left into the ''Veloursstraat'', and at the next crossing you can enter the ''Enschedesestraat''. \\nAfter some meters (behind the bridge) you'll find enough place to try hitching towards [[Enschede]]. It's only some 5 km.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Germany]] {{Ade|30}}, West towards [[Apeldoorn]], [[Utrecht]], [[Amsterdam]] ===\\n====Option 1====\\nTake the bus #11 and get out at ''Kleine Driene''. It's situated directly near the ramp ''Hengelo-Noord'' onto the [[A1 (Netherlands)|A1]]. Just walk the street some 500 meter up. Then you can decide, going towards [[Germany]] or direction [[Amsterdam]]. Be prepared: Hitchhiking on this spot might be hard, because the traffic lights that lead cars to the ramps on the highway in either direction are as good as allways green. This and the fact that there is no real spot for cars to stop to pick you up, will make it hard to take off. \\n\\n====Option 2, Service station Lonnekermeer {{Anl|1}}====\\n{{Coords|52.2814|6.8526}}<br>\\nFrom the train station Hengelo take bus 14 to ''Bruninkshoek''. You now find yourself on the street ''Oostelijke Esweg''. Walk in the direction the bus just came from towards the street ''Hasselerbaan'', then turn left. Walk down until you cross ''Oldenzaalsestraat''. Turn left and you will see a footbridge overlooking the {{Anl|1}}. When you have crossed the bridge, don't turn right but walk through the grass and descend down. Turn left before the ditch and walk with the ditch on your right (The same direction the cars go on this side of the highway) Continue until you see a little forest; here you have to jump over a small ditch. Walk through the little forest and you will reach an excellent service station where nearly all cars go to Germany. \\n\\n===West towards [[Apeldoorn]],[[Utrecht]], [[Amsterdam]]===\\n{{Coords|52.2429|6.7650}}<br>\\nTake bus 53 towards [[Haaksbergen]] and get out at the stop ''Platinastraat'' (1,50 euro). There you can see a big gas station where cars going towards the highway can stop easily. The highway is located just 400 metres from the gas station in the direction of the busstop. From this gas station you can decide whether you ask the drivers who stop there for gas for a ride or whether you'll make a sign and try your luck with oldschool hitchiking; the cars can stop at the gas station very easily. \\n\\n\\n== Overall Rating ==\\nThis city is quite a bad place to hitchhike, because in the city, even at the roads to the motorway, there is not enough space where cars can stop. The only chance is in the evening when it's no problem for cars to stop in middle of road (only exception to this problem is option 4 towards Apeldoorn, Utrecht).\\n\\n<!--Infoboxes and categories.

Secondly, the motorway leads in many directions, so \\'\\'\\'you\\'ll probably need a sign\\'\\'\\'!\\n\\n=== West towards [[Ringkøbing]] and South/West towards [[Esbjerg]] ===\\n\\nYou could probably use the same place as above, just with a different sign, but maybe there\\'s not a lot going that way from there. No other options towards Esbjerg is currently known.\\n\\nWest towards [[Ringkøbing]] you could go with bus 15 or 952X, both towards Ringkøbing, or city bus 3, to \\'Snejbjerg Hovedgade v. (by) Nordgaden\\'. The stop is right after a traffic light on the main street of the town Snejbjerg. As with above, you could also just walk. It\\'s an hours walk from the central bus station though, roughly 5.5 kilometres. Walking 1.5 kilometres (further!) on the main street out of Snejbjerg, you\\'ll see a roundabout, where the first road on the right leads to Ringkøbing. \\nYou can also try walking just outside of Herning on the east side, and try to catch a ride on Ringkøbingvej towards Snejbjerg (3 kilometres from the central bus station). The cars towards Ringkøbing are going this way anyway, but most cars will go no further than Snejbjerg.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Silkeborg]], [[Aarhus]] ===\\n\\nAgain, you could use the on-ramp mentioned in the South/East section. There is no experience registered in this direction yet, as possibilities to get on the motorway other places aren\\'t great. One possibility could be trying th round about on the west side of the city, before road 15 chances into a highway.\\nA third possibility is to try to take the main road (not highway) to [[Ikast]] and try to get on the highway towards Aarhus, Silkeborg.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Viborg]], [[Aalborg]] ===\\n\\nGo to Viborgvej by taking city buses 9A or 9B or regional bus 13 towards Skive or 53 towards Viborg and get off at \\'Viborgvej v.

It\\'s also easy to reach from University Campus. Hitch a ride for approximately 5 km, until you meet the railway. Just 10m behind the railway is a small bay where drivers can drop you off.

Many drivers are going far, possibly even as far as Eastern Europe or even further. The truck terminal is a bit further down the road too. If you're trying at the car terminal, you can stand perfectly on the train crossing as there is construction going on.\\n\\nInform yourself about the ferry arrival times on the Stena Line website. It takes time to unload all cars, expect roughly one per minute.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking in ==\\nThere is a metro station (Hoek van Holland haven) right next to the ferry terminal, which is easily reachable from Rotterdam central station.\\n\\nYou stand a slight chance of finding drivers on the A20 coming from the direction of Gouda, but most of them will be going into Rotterdam itself.\\n\\n== Accommodation and Sleep ==\\nAny kind of hotel / hostel / whatever will be insanely expensive here as they're mostly used by commercial drivers who have businesses paying for them. It's a small town, so wild camping should be easily possible on the outskirts which you can reach on foot. However, bushes make it hard to camp inside city parks as well as sand on the ground preventing you from properly pitching some tents.\\n\\nThere were people drifting their cars in the industrial area and I heard gunshots shortly after midnight to the North of the town.\\n\\nMuch more advisable to sleep in Rotterdam and come here early in the morning if catching a ferry!\\n\\n{{Cities Netherlands}}\\n{{Cities Zuid-Holland}}\\n\\n[[Category:City's]]\\n[[de:Hoek_van_Holland]]\",\n",

The town is 31 miles (50 km) south south-west of London, 18.5 miles (30 km) north-west of Brighton and 26 miles (42 km) north-east of the county town of Chichester. Nearby towns include Crawley to the north-east and Haywards Heath and Burgess Hill to the south-east. It is the administrative and market centre of Horsham District Council area.\\n\\n== Hitching out ==\\n=== North towards [[Dorking]] ===\\n\\nHeading North should be no problem on the roundabout junction of the A264 and the A24. On the Northbound carriageway just after the roundabout is a large concrete hatched area in front of an electricity substation (?) that cannot be used for parking but is ideal for lifts to pull in to. Traffic is also slowed because of the roundabout. (Lat 51.087513, Lon 0.333753)\\n\\n=== South towards [[Cowfold]]/[[Worthing]]/[[Brighton]] ===\\n\\n=== West towards [[Guildford]]/[[Petworth]] ===\\n\\n[[Broadbridge Heath]] is a small village on the Western outskirts of Horsham. It has the main Tescos supermarket and petrol station as well as a smaller Shell petrol station. Both of these can be good hitching grounds. Alternatively walk through Broadbridge Heath to hitch on the A281 towards [[Godalming]] and [[Guildford]]\\n\\nIf headed towards [[Billingshurst]] and [[Petworth]] walk further to the left and there is a Garden Center on the A264 with a good space to pull over.\\n\\n=== East towards {{mgb|23}}/[[Crawley]]/[[Brighton]] ===\\n\\nThe {{mgb|23}} is a trunk motorway/road that runs from London to Brighton. It is approximately 6 miles to the East of Horsham and the service station at [[Pease Pottage]] can be used to travel both North and South.\\n\\n2 spots are ideal for hitching out of [[Horsham]] in this direction. The roundabout on the corner of the A264 as it meets Horsham is a good spot. There is a slight lay-by on the North bound carriage way just after the roundabout and traffic is slower. (Lat 51.084062, Lon 0.289249)\\n\\nAlternatively \\'\\'Forest Road\\'\\' is a smaller \\'B\\' road that runs directly to [[Pease Pottage]] and so most traffic heading this way will pass through here.

The Travel Lodge hotel situated in the centre of town next to the Shelley Fountain (Water feature that often does not work and resembles a giant Chicken Nugget (ironically next to the towns only McDonalds)) offers cheap rooms (Circa £30 pn). Premiere Inn, located opposite Horsham Railways Station, may also have cheap accomodation\\n\\n=== Wild Camping ===\\n\\nWild camping is possible all around Horsham. There are a number of small copses\\' of woodland within Horsham and is partially surrounded by St Leonards Forest on the Eastern side. The easiest way to access these woods would be through the \\'\\'\\'\\'Leechpool Woods\\'\\'\\'\\' car park off of \\'\\'Harwood Road B2195\\'\\'.

If you ever get lost in ''Hörstel'', '''don't panic!''' \\n\\nEven if it seems that people in this part of Westfalia are not really interested in picking up hitchhikers, there are ways to get out of there. Buses to [[Rheine]] or [[Ibbenbüren]] are rare, so if so, try this:\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== West towards [[Rheine]], [[Netherlands]] ===\\n* From the city center, walk towards the catholic church which is situated on the only traffic lamps in town. There, walk left towards [[Rheine]]. After some meters you'll find a petrol station. You could try to ask some people there if they go anywhere to a ramp nearby. If there are no cars, walk another 500 meter until you are out of town. There is a bus stop with enough space for cars to stop.\\n\\n* If you have no success with the first spot, walk further along the road until you see a roundabout. Go straight towards [[Rheine]] (just follow the signs, there are a lot of them) for around 1,5 km, until you see the holy ramp to the [[A30 (Germany)|A30]]. The first one is going towards [[Rheine]], [[Salzbergen]]. Try to catch a lift there if you want to go towards the [[Netherlands]]. Even if people are not going further, try to get a lift to the on-ramp ''Rheine-Nord'', this is where most traffic might go to. From there, you will have much better chances to catch rides westwards.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Osnabrück]], [[Ibbenbüren]] ===\\n\\n* You can try the same ramp as described above, but for more success eastwards try the direct '''Hörstel''' ramp: At the train station, go uphill towards the protestant church. In front of it, walk left towards [[Ibbenbüren]] and follow the street until it's end after 1,5 km. Then go right and you'll see the motorway [[A30 (Germany)|A30]]. For direction [[Osnabrück]], watch out for the sign saying [[Hannover]].\\n\\n* If you want to hitchhike towards [[Ibbenbüren]] or the countryside via sideroads, walk to the roundabout in the eastern part of Hörstel. From the service station ''KTS'', walk in direction of the traffic lights and follow the road for around 500m until you find the roundabout. Behind the roundabout you'll find enough space for cars to stop and even a bus bay (never saw any bus there) some meters behind.\\n\\n== Sleeping ==\\nIf you get stuck in Hörstel, go to the ''Torfmoorsee'', find a quite and hidden place in the woods and go camping there. Nevertheless, it's illegal to do wild camping in Germany, but who will find you there in the middle of nowhere?

Take the Bus 9226 in direction of \"Beilngries\" or the Bus number 30 in direction of \"Niederfeld\" and hop off the bus on the station \"Hepberg, Römerstrasse\". From there you can walk 1,8 km  north towards the gas station directly at the highway.\\n\\nA9 South\\nThere is also a gas station at Köschinger forst (details at A9 north direction) on the side where the cars go south. But maybe there is a better option south of Ingolstadt. \\n\\n== Hitchhiking in ==\\n\\nThere are two direct Highway exits where you can be droped off quite central and with access to public Transport. There are called Ingolstadt Nord and Ingolstadt Süd. Its also possible to be droped off at Köschinger Forst a little bit north of Ingolstadt and walk towards Hepberg and from there take a bus in the city center. But the buses are not that regular so the first two option should be better.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n[[Category:Bavaria]]\\n[[Category:Germany]]\\n\\n[[de:Ingolstadt]]',\n",

It is situated north of the [[Brenner|Brenner-pass]], one of the main south-north crossing traffic axes in the Alps, squeezed in the Inn River valley which dictates the directions of the traffic ways.\\nDue to the lack of space in the Inn River valley, Innsbruck offers 5 different motorway exits and a complicated system of traffic lanes.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== Heading West or South ===\\nThere\\'s the service station \\'\\'Raststätte Innsbruck-Ampass\\'\\' on the motorway east of town, in the direction west. However it\\'s before the turnoff going south to Italy, so you\\'ll find most cars going south. \\n\\nAlso, if you want to go west, keep in mind that the first petrol station after Innsbruck (\\'\\'Pettnau\\'\\', 25km west of Innsbruck) is on the other side of the motorway. People going west \\'\\'\\'can\\'\\'\\' fuel up there, but again you\\'ll find almost only cars going south to Italy. \\n\\n\\nTowards Switzerland from the central bus station you can take the bus 4166 or 4165 to Völs \"Metzgerei Singer\". (From Dez shopping centre to central station there\\'s a bus 4134 or 4130 from the other side of the roundabout). When you reach Völs, walk north to the shopping centre with a JET tankstelle (gas station). Maybe you can find someone to take you further along the highway to another petrol station where there will be more traffic heading west (many people from that area are going back into the city or driving south). And on Sundays there is the Cyta Flea Market til 2pm, which is basically set up surrounding the gas station.\\n\\n==== How to get there (Raststätte Innsbruck-Ampass, east of Innsbruck) ====\\nTake bus F or R to \\'\\'Baggersee\\'\\'. \\nOnce there, continue Grabenweg street for 400m north-east, until you reach the Inn river. Turn right and follow the street, not the trail. It\\'ll lead to \\'\\'Freizeitzentrum Rossau\\'\\', and just before the street ends there\\'s a way off to the left, to the Freizeitzentrum\\'s parking place. \\nContinue the path to the golf course and find your way into the little forest behind and above it. There\\'s a path in the forest, continue that to the right. At one point after about 200m the path splits, go downhill on the left. There you are on the service station\\'s parking!\\n\\n(There might be a shorter way from Baggersee bus stop going through the bushes between Kläranlage and Baggersee, however that isn\\'t yet verified.)\\n\\n=== All directions: South ([[Italy]]), East ([[Salzburg]], [[Vienna]]), North ([[Germany]], [[Munich]]), West ([[Bregenz]]) ===\\nGo to the shopping-centre DEZ, Ikea (by bus C (EUR 1.70) or walk from the centre in 20 min) - there are two petrol stations and a big parking space, McD, where you can ask and hitch out in all directions.\\n\\nYou can also use the on-ramp Innsbruck-West if you\\'re in that part of town. There\\'s a bus stop (might be \\'Hafen\\', bus C and M?) a bit before it that only catches some of the traffic going onto the highway here, but with a sign you can easily find a ride into the right direction from here. \\n\\nIf you don\\'t find lifts to the next city try to get lifts to the next biggest motorway service area (Raststätte) outside of Innsbruck:\\n* East: Vomp\\n* West: Pettnau\\n* South: Brenner\\n\\n=== Heading East towards [[Salzburg]], [[Rosenheim]], [[Munich]] ===\\nStarting point: Exit Innbruck Ost (East), at the fuel stations on the very end of Amraser-See-Straße, next to the DEZ shopping mall.\\nThere is 2 petrol stations (just next to each other) on the street to the high-way. At the second one there was also a sign \"Last petrol station before the high-way\" - Easy to ask drivers there... \\n\\n==== Getting there by bus ====\\nLine C (direction Luigenstraße) exit DEZ, or line T exit DEZ Ost, and walk the last few meters towards the biggest road close by. Check [http://www.ivb.at/fileadmin/download/fahrplan/mein-fahrplan/liniennetzplan/ivb_liniennetzplan_schematisch_2008.pdf the schematic map of the local public transport] or [http://www.ivb.at/index.php?id=ivb&L=1 their webpage] also in English for further information.\\n\\nMake a sign indicating your desired direction\\n\\n==== Gas station in schwaz ====\\nIF you don\\'t want to hitchhike in a city you can blackride with train or bus about 25km to town called Schwaz and then walk 15 minutes to a gas station on highway and hitchhike in direction Rosenheim, Munich or Salzburg.\\n\\n\\n\\n=== Heading North to [[Germany]] via Fernpass ===\\nTo go to Germany via Fernpass the easiest option is to take a bus to Nassereith. The buses go from the city (from main strain station for example) and Nassereith is often the final destination. You can easily take the bus for free. They don\\'t ask for ticket while entering. Just go in and sit down. It takes about an hour of bus drive but Nassereith is already on the road to Fernpass which becomes A7 after the border. If the bus go to a station abzweigung Sankt wendelin go to there. From there you can just walk two minutes and hitchhike directly on the main road. It is an ok spot and there is plenty of trafic towards Germany. The first gas station in Germany is after Kempten so if you are going further up north get a lift at least to there or stay in Austria and find a longer lift before the road turns into a highway.\\nTo search for a bus connection you can try ivb.at\\nIf you don\\'t like buses you can also take a local train to Telfs. They often don\\'t control the tickets at all. In telfs you need to walk across the town and hitch on a road leading to Fernpass street. But it will take you much more time so i recomend to take the bus.\\n\\n\\n=== Heading North or West ([[Landeck]], [[Reutte]], [[Füssen]], [[Kempten]], [[Scharnitz]], [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], [[Munich]]) ===\\nThere are several opportunities in Innsbruck but no real \"first choice\" option. So here is one:\\n\\n==== Motorway exit Innsbruck Kranebitten ====\\nThis a a lonely motorway exit in the very west of Innsbruck with a free Space just in the middle of the different lanes joining together in the direction of Bregenz and Germany. It is not a nice spot but it works! \\n\\n===== Getting there by bus =====\\nTake line T of the IVB Buses running towards \"EKZ CYTA\" a suburban shopping centre. You are passing the motorway exit by bus just after crossing the Inn River bridge. Get of the Bus at EKZ Cyta, get all you need at the shopping centre and walk back to the motorway exit, which comes first after the roundabout. \\n\\nCheck [http://www.ivb.at/fileadmin/download/fahrplan/mein-fahrplan/liniennetzplan/ivb_liniennetzplan_schematisch_2008.pdf the schematic map of the local public transport] or [http://www.ivb.at/index.php?id=ivb&L=1 their webpage] also in English for further information.\\n\\nA sign indicating your desired direction might help you getting along. Good luck!\\n\\nJust a kilometre after you enter the motorway, the road splits up - one minor road running north directly to [[Germany]] ([[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], [[Munich]]) and the motorway continuing to run west - make sure you are in the desired direction!\\n\\n==== Resselstraße ====\\nA less awkward place to hitch north or west is by the bus stop at Resselstraße, next to the stadium. Drivers can see you easily here and there is lots of space to stop. [[User:Jophro|Jophro]] got a ride here in 20 mins after failing to find one in 45 mins at the aforementioned DEZ centre, same for [[User:madde|madde]]. It\\'s clearly a popular spot (you\\'ll notice a worn patch of grass ahead of the bus stop) - when he arrived another hitchhiker was there who got a ride in 7 mins. He found it more effective to take his approach and simply write \\'D\\', instead of the city - if you\\'re going to Germany.\\nIn case you are confused, although the road signs are hard to see, its the bus stop next to the stadium, not the one in the opposite side of the street.\\n\\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\\n\\n[[nomad:Innsbruck]] [[trash:Innsbruck]]\\n\\n\\n[[Category:Austria]]\\n[[Category:E45]]\\n[[Category:E60]]\\n[[de:Innsbruck]]\\n{{IsIn|Austria}}\\n{{Category|City\\'s}}',\n",

It is one of the seven communities located on the largest island in Canada, the [[Baffin Island]]. Its population varies between 6.000 and 8.000, half of them being Inuit. \\n\\nLike the other Baffin Island communities, Iqaluit is \\'\\'\\'only accessible by air all year long and by sea from July to October\\'\\'\\' according to the weather conditions. It is therefore a remote place for the hitcher.\\n\\n[[Image:Road_to_Nowhere.jpg|thumb|270px|right|the \\'\\'\\'Road to Nowhere\\'\\'\\']] During winter, \\'\\'\\'snowmobiles\\'\\'\\' are a preferred way of transportation in Iqaluit as in everywhere else in the \\'Great North\\', this allows you a higher flexibility of transportation through the frozen land. Note that you may try to get a snowmobile ride to the community of [[Kimmirut]] (also known as Lake Harbour) which is a bit more than two hours away. Some people make it a day trip. \\n\\nMost older settlements were built by military at the lowest material cost to be exclusively functional mainly because of the cost of material importation, which does not bring any particular interest towards architecture. Nowadays, the town is of political importance, which makes it a thriving community. The interests in the area remain in the large unspoiled Nordic landscape, midnight sun and other natural interests.\\n\\nIqaluit hosts the hitchhikingly famous \\'\\'\\'Road to Nowhere\\'\\'\\'. It really leads nowhere.\\n\\nEverything is within walking distance, but people use the ubiquitous taxis, as they are available at a flat rate (6$).\\n\\n== Hitchhiking ==\\nHitching within the community is very limited as the road network only stretch of about a kilometre outside town to the community of Apex, officially part of Iqaluit. Because of the non-existent hitchhiking culture, Inuit don\\'t really understand what the gesture is for, though they might stop out of curiosity. There are a lot of cars, and people often give rides to pedestrians they know, especially when the weather is harsh.\\n\\nIt would be very difficult for a hitchhiker to reach Iqaluit overland. During the summer, one could try [[Hitchhiking a boat]] to Baffin Island which would be one of those three situations:\\n\\n* Cargo boat or sealift coming from [[Montreal]]\\n* Round-the-world or adventure sailboats (harder to find)\\n* Arctic cruise ship : most come from [[Nuuk]] in [[Greenland]] and stop in Iqaluit before heading South. They are not regular lines. \\n\\nKeep in mind that there is no marina in Iqaluit, not even a dock. Ships remain in the Frobisher Bay while a barge unloads the goods. Smaller boats are sent for people. This could make it very difficult to hitch out of the community. \\n\\nOne could try [[Hitchhiking a plane]]. The passenger airlines reaching Iqaluit from communities linked to Canada\\'s main road network are [http://www.canadiannorth.com/ Canadian North], [http://www.firstair.ca/ First Air] and [http://www.aircanada.com/ AirCanada]. They depart from [[Montreal]] and [[Ottawa]], and indirect routes from [[Winnipeg]], [[Edmonton]] and [[Yellowknife]]. But as airliners are usually not good to hitchhike on, one could have more chances with cargo flights, some of which also leave from [[Val d\\'Or]] in Quebec. It varies with the time of the year and weather conditions. \\n\\nPrivate plane owners could be found by networking with Nunavut\\'s only flying club : [http://polarpilots.ca/ Polar Pilots]\\n\\nEven though some adventurers historically crossed to Baffin Island from the mainland, this is not something you should consider. The currents in the Hudson Strait are very strong and locals do not venture there, very few would cross by boat during summer. During winter, changes in the climate also make Arctic sea ice formation less predictable and reliable, and some straits that use to freeze fast cannot be trusted anymore. People also tend to believe that the Hudson Strait freezes over the winter, but multiple sources and local\\'s knowledge contradict this.

Border crossings shouldn\\'t be a problem, but avoid revealing yourself as a hitchhiker at the border, since it might still be considered as part of the highway and thus illegal. Hitchhiking is a bit less common than in France or [[Germany]], but it\\'s very well possible and doable. Just don\\'t expect high speeds (particularly in the north) and be prepared for a night on the road.\\n\\nIn Italy, you will find motorways (\\'\\'autostrada\\'\\' -- \\'\\'A\\'\\') and state roads (\\'\\'Strada Statale\\'\\' -- \\'\\'SS\\'\\'). Hitchhiking on the \\'\\'autostrada\\'\\' is generally illegal (this includes petrol stations, check the [[Italy#Legal situation|legal section of this article]] for details); to avoid problems you can try hitchhiking on the \\'\\'strade statale\\'\\'. It takes little bit more time, but you meet more local people and you can see the countryside.\\n\\nHitchhiking the motorways still works well. If you stick to  petrol stations (Autogrill) and that you try to speak a bit italian, it should be fine. Even if the drivers can\\'t take you, they\\'ll decline politely. As said upper, avoid hitchhiking when the police is around. Try not to be dropped at tolls.\\n\\nYou can get a free map of a whole Italy at almost every [[petrol station hitchhiking|petrol station]] (\\'\\'autogrill\\'\\') or [https://www.autostrade.it/en/la-nostra-rete/carta-dei-servizi here]. This map has all petrol stations marked in the map. Getting rides on petrol stations is generally easy. Toilets are free at petrol stations in Italy. Make sure to stay on friendly terms with the staff.\\n\\nIf you make a [[sign]], try writing the name of a sensibly chosen city some 200-300km in the right direction. For example, if you\\'re heading from Milano to Napoli, few people will be going that far in one stretch. So try writing first \\'\\'Firenze\\'\\', then \\'\\'Roma\\'\\' and finally \\'\\'Napoli\\'\\'. You might get there in just those three stops.\\n\\nTrucks do not drive on either Saturdays or Sundays, so if you prefer to drive with them, a good time to get a ride with them is early morning on a Monday.\\n\\n== Roads ==\\nAs described above, you\\'ll find in Italy motorways \"Autostrada\" and state roads \"Strada Statale\". Motorways look pretty much like French ones : contrary to Germany, there are tollgates where drivers have to get slower.\\n\\nRoads in Italy, both state roads and motorways especially in the North, are surprisingly heavily arranged : there are lots of barriers or rails on the side of the roads, and lots of (really lots of) tunnels to cross uneven landscapes and ranges. In the North, in the Alps, some roads are only succession of tunnels (like in Aosta valley), and sometimes even tiny roads leading to a small valley will have barriers one both sides. You can then sometimes get stuck because there is absolutely no place to hitchhike and stop a car, on a road between two tunnels and barriers on both sides.\\n\\nMore generally, roads in Italy are quite tight, although really almost all the time very well sealed, and finding a good spot to hitch is maybe a bit difficult in mountains regions. Also because roads are stirring a lot, maybe more than in others countries.\\n\\nThere is one thing that you also have to consider that, even if you see an autogrill or petrol station on the motorway not so far from you, you have to be prepared that it will like a fortress with massive fences.\\n\\n== Legal situation ==\\n[[File:No_autostop_en_italia.JPG|thumb|left|[[User:Quarim|Quarim]] and a \\'\\'NO autostop\\'\\' sign.]]\\n[[File:WhatsApp Image 2024-06-11 at 10.39.40 (1) (1).jpg|thumb|Jurichezzbmx hitchhiking at the entrance of the Italian motorways, holding its thumb by a huge \"no autostop\" sign. Impressive but ju got a ride within 10min. Watch out for the cops tho.]]\\n\\n\\'\\'Art. 175 co. 7, capo B\\'\\' of the Italian \\'\\'codice della strada\\'\\' states: \\n\\n*\\'\\'Sulle carreggiate, sulle rampe, sugli svincoli, sulle aree di servizio o di parcheggio e in ogni altra pertinenza autostradale è vietato (…) richiedere o concedere passaggi.\\'\\'\\n*\\'\\'On roadways, on-ramps, junctions, service or parking areas and on any other area belonging to the \\'\\'autostrada\\'\\' it is forbidden (...) to ask for or grant rides.\\'\\'\\n\\nThe law is pretty clear, and while it is not at all unusual in Europe that hitchhiking right on the motorway is illegal, Italy explicitly includes service areas into the law as well.  Be aware that drivers picking you up may also be fined; for hitchhikers, the fine appears to be 21 euros, for drivers up to 137 euros.  \\n\\nOf course it is still possible to hitch the width and length of Italy on freeways without being fined all the time. On-ramps and exits of petrol stations have big signs saying \\'\\'no autostop\\'\\'; if you stay before those, you should be fine; even if police have a problem, they will mostly just ask you to move further away from the sign. The ban on hitchhiking is not generally enforced in highway gas stations, but all the more when you\\'re in a place where it actually is potentially dangerous to stand. It can happen that they ask you to leave a gas station and continue by train (see [[https://nomadwiki.org/en/Italy#public_transport|public transportation section in NomadWiki]] for advice on how to travel for free by train). Generally it is smart to lower your thumb and try to look like a straying botanist or something whenever you see coppers approaching near the motorway. \\n\\nAccording to [http://www.laleggepertutti.it/94376_autostop-chiedere-un-passaggio-e-illegale this legal article (Italian)], this does not apply to \\'\\'tangenziale\\'\\', bypasses, unless they are \\'\\'autostrade\\'\\' or other high-velocity roads. All in all, it\\'s less likely that you will encounter problems if you\\'re not Italian -- and, if you speak Italian, don\\'t reveal this to police (or the armed forces, \\'\\'carabinieri\\'\\').\\n\\nBorder crossings that are on the motorways (such as the Grand Saint-Bernard at the Swiss border) might be considered by the police as part of the highway. [[User:Olche Maith|Nina]] was hitchhiking with a nice truck driver who was trying to help her get her next ride at the border, but the policeman did not allow her to continue hitchhiking (even not to stay in the truck with the same driver!) and instead drove her to the bus stop and gave her money (much more than required for the bus). Others might not be so generous though.\\n\\nEdit: (TommytheCommie) We had no success trying to hitchhike from the toll bridges at the entrance to highways (autostrade). Everybody in Italy knows it\\'s illegal to hitchhike on the highway. The police moved us back to the roundabout before the toll bridge, which was fine, but nobody was stopping in either position. So instead we hitchhiked on minor roads (named SS-9/10/etc.) and never waited longer than thirty minutes once we found a good spot. We hitchhiked down from Alessandria to Bologna on the Via Emilia (SS-9), getting short rides of 20 or 50 km at a time, but never waiting long.\\n\\n== Safety ==\\n\\nThe northern part of Italy is quite safe, but take care in the South. When pitching a tent in the wild, make very sure to stay out of sight. Roads are often not laid out for bicyclists and pedestrians which makes it harder to walk towards or find good spots. Some areas, especially on the outskirts of cities such as [[Rome]], can be dodgy for single female travellers for the reason that prostitutes frequent these places. When you get into a car, make sure that the driver\\'s motives are not determined by his meat loaf. \\n\\n==Getting out==\\n\\n=== North across the Alps ===\\n\\nTake the motorway [[A23 (Italy)|A23]] (in the eastern part of Italy) to [[Austria]] (don\\'t try to hitchhike through [[Switzerland]], it\\'s very difficult). Follow the [[A23 (Italy)|A23]] to [[Villach]] and [[Salzburg]] to get through the Alps very easy. On that way, you will also find a lot of people heading to [[Hungary]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Slovenia]].\\nYou can also try to hitch [[A22 (Italy)|A22]] to [[Bolzano]], [[Innsbruck]] over the [[Brennero]], but it\\'s quite difficult to find a hitch from A4 to the A22 except when it is holiday time.  \\n\\nAlso, don\\'t go via [[Milano]], it\\'s really difficult to get out of the ring because almost everybody drives into Milano and very few stop at service areas located nearby.\\n\\nThere are a lot of tourists from Austria and Germany, especially in summertime. The new European car plates start with a letter on the left side of the plate, representing the country. Most Austrian (A on a plate) and German (D on a plate) are on the way to the sea or on their way back from holidays, so if you want to go North or South, try to find Germans or Austrians (usually, they speak better English than the Italians, too).\\n\\nAnother option is stay on the [[A4 (Italy)|A4]] and ask trucks on the petrol stations. Many trucks go to Austria, Slovakia, Poland and more north through Slovenia to tank diesel there because there is cheaper diesel and on the roads there aren\\'t so many hills so it saves fuel.\\n\\nEdit: (TheLoneBaker)  Crossing the Alps via Switzerland from the A9 seemed to be extremely easy.  Lots of traffic at the service stations.  Probably not worth the effort to go a different route if already in Western Italy.\\n\\n== Regions and cities in Italy ==\\n\\n{|\\n|-\\n!Region\\n!City\\n|-\\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; padding-right:3em;\" |\\n* [[Calabria]]\\n* [[Südtirol]] \\n* [[Sardegna]]\\n* [[Sicily]]\\n\\n| style=\" padding-right:3em;\" |\\n* [[Agrigento]]\\n* [[Bergamo]]\\n* [[Brindisi]]\\n* [[Bologna]]\\n* [[Catania]]\\n* [[Cosenza]]\\n* [[Enna]] \\n* [[Firenze|Florence]]\\n* [[Foggia]]\\n* [[Genova]]\\n* [[Milano]]\\n* [[Napoli]]\\n* [[Padova]]\\n* [[Palermo]]\\n* [[Rome]]\\n* [[Sabaudia]]\\n* [[Torino]]\\n* [[Trento]]\\n* [[Trieste]]\\n* [[Venice]]\\n|}\\n\\n=== Ferries between Italy and Greece ===\\n\\nIt\\'s possible to hitchhike from south-eastern Italy to Greece, but it seems to be quite difficult. Find more information [[Ferries_between_Italy_and_Greece|here]].\\n\\n== Language ==\\n\\nAs in any foreign country, learning some of the language is recommended. Aside from Italian and local dialects, French is spoken in some areas of Piedmont and especially the Aosta Valley in which it is a co-official language, as well as German in South Tyrol. A handful of words from a local dialect may make drivers loosen up. Spanish is easy for Italians to understand. English is less widely spread than in more northerly countries.\\n\\n\"Hitchhiking\" is \\'\\'autostop\\'\\' or \\'\\'passaggio\\'\\' in Italian. Just say \\'\\'faccio autostop\\'\\' or \\'\\'cerco un passaggio\\'\\' and the name of your your destination or show your thumb, otherwise Italians might think you are asking directions as Italy gets a lot of tourists.

It is a university city with around 100.000 inhabitants. \\n\\n= Hitchhiking out =\\n\\nHitching out of Jena is not easy, but neither is it impossible. It really depends on what direction you want to go. Essentially there are two motorways from which to start, the A9 going north-south from [[Berlin]] to [[Munich]], and the A4 going east-west from  [[Frankfurt]] to [[Dresden]].\\n\\n== East towards [[Frankfurt]], west towards [[Dresden]] {{Autobahn|4}} ==\\n\\nThe A4 passes Jena straight at its eastern style southern edge, Lobeda. You can either start hitching directly here or take the train and a 3 km walk to \\'\\'Rasthof Teufelstal\\'\\' (~20 km from Jena). If you want to start hitching straight from Jena there are several places to start. There is an ARAL gas station directly at the on-ramp towards [[Dresden]].\\n\\n=== Starting in Jena ===\\n\\nStarting straight from Jena is not very easy but not impossible either, all is starting from the eastern style Lobeda. For all following options take the tram until \"Emil Wölk Straße\" in Lobeda. \\n\\n==== 1. Petrol Station ====\\nIf you prefer the option to ask folks at petrol stations you can try the Aral station close to the Mc Donalds in the \"Gewerbegebiet Lobeda Süd\". To get here walk along the small footpath besides the Stadtrodaer Straße (5 min from the tram station). Be aware that even though the stations is quite busy, most of the traffic seems to go to villages nearby so you may have to wait for a while until you get a lift (for example for 4h on a Saturday afternoon).\\n\\n==== 2. On-ramps ====\\nFor those trying their luck via thumb and sign, I would suggest waiting straight at the pedestrian traffic lights directly on the on-ramp in direction Frankfurt. Cars will stop at the red light (possibly induced by you ;-) ) and have time to think about picking you up. Hitching east (Gera, A9,...) your best option is the on-ramp opposite the Aral station. Even though the cars from Jena will not use it, there is a good place to stop here for cars in contrast to the route used by cars from Jena.\\n\\n==== 3. Bus station ====\\nThere is a big bus station (\"Arbeitsamt\") straight on the \"Stadtrodaer Straße \"so cars can stop here easily. Everybody leaving Jena for the A4 will pass you and the traffic lights will cause cars to stop and think about picking you up. Its 2 minutes from the tram station \"Emil Wölk Straße\" directly at the bridge of \"Erlanger Alle\" over \"Stadtrodaer Straße\". Make sure that you carry a sign!\\n\\n\\nAll these options may involve long waiting times (>1h) so, especially if you are not female, you should consider the other options described that get you straight to rest places on the highway.\\n\\n=== Trainride to Rasthof Teufelstal ===\\n\\nIf you are generally not that lucky thumbing down cars and you would like to start your journey straight at the motorway, the easiest option is to travel to Rasthof Teufelstal which is located at the A4 approx. 15 km east of Jena. From here it should be no problem to ask people for lifts east or west. To get there either take the local train from Jena West towards Gera and get off at \"Papiermühle\". From here it is a (scenic) 3 km hike first east along the valley and then south to the small village of Bollberg. From here you either cross the fields directly to the Rasthof if heading west or cross the motorway (walk towards Mörsdorf after Böllberg) and head east at the other side for hitching east.\\n\\n== North to [[Berlin]], south to [[Munich]] {{Autobahn|9}} ==\\n\\nThe A9 as a main north south motorway passes Jena approx. 25 km east of the city. As it is probably difficult (though still an option) to use the above described options to start on the A4 and then change on the A9 you are probably better off aiming at the A9 straight away. You could either travel to the petrol station \"Hermsdorfer Kreuz\" straight on the motorway, start at a petrol station in Eisenberg or hitch towards the A9 on local roads.\\n\\n=== Starting from Jena ===\\nIf you are a die hard hitchhiker and want to start hitching in Jena you can hitch along local roads towards the A9. This makes sense as many locals (especially if heading north at the A9) also take the local roads instead of the A4 to get to the A9. You should aim at getting a lift as far as Eisenberg as here is a good petrol station really close to the A9. \\n\\nTake a tram until \\'\\'Jenzigweg\\'\\' and thumb down cars at the bus station there. This is easier if you have a sign stating \\'\\'A9/Eisenberg\\'\\'. Most of the rides either get you to the A9 onramp, [[Leipzig]] or [[Berlin]].\\n\\n=== Hermsdorfer Kreuz ===\\nIt should be easy to get a lift at this busy service station. The tricky bit is how to get here from Jena. Either take the local train from Jena West towards [[Gera]] and get off in [[Hermsdorf]]. From here take the 3-4 km/45 minute walk south through the whole village, past the A4, and finally turning right into the bushes at the Busstop onto the hiking trail towards the \\'\\'Teufelstal\\'\\'. Alternatively you can take bus 200 (direction [[Gera]]), 444 (direction Stadtroda) or 427 (direction Jena/Stadtroda) from the station in Hermsdorf (they go approx. every 30 minutes) and get off at \\'\\'Hermsdorf Fußweg Rasthof\\'\\'. From here it is a 5 minute walk through the forest. Another option is to take bus 444 straight from Jena (or 427 from Stadtroda) towards Hermsdorf and get off at the same station.\\n\\nUnlucky hitchhikers who get stuck at Rasthof Teufelstal on the A4 but want to change to the A9 can also do the scenic hike from Teufelstal to Hermsdorfer Kreuz (~4km/1h) Just follow the hiking trail marked with a green stripe which passes south of the service station at Teufelsthal south into the valley and head east uphill at a small junction following the same marks. In case you find a helpful driver ask him/her if he could turn south at the A4/A9 junction (Hermsdorfer Kreuz) onto the A9 towards [[Munich|München]], drop you off at the service station, turn around at the ramp \"Hermsdorf Süd\" and get back onto the A4. This may take him 5-10 minutes.\\n\\n=== From [[Eisenberg]] ===\\nEisenberg lies ~25km east of Jena straight at the A9.There is a good petrol station directly at the motorway in a commercial area which is a good start to ask for lifts. To get here by public transport take bus 431 from Jena and get off at \\'\\'Gewerbegebiet, Petersberg bei Eisenberg\\'\\' (45 minutes). You can also hitch along the Bundesstraße from Jena.\\n\\n= Hitching in =\\nAsk you driver to get off at the off-ramp \"Jena-Zentrum\", afterwards turn towards \"Zenrum\" on \"Stadtrodaer Straße\" and to turn right on the first turn off (towards \"Klinikum\"). You will immediately reach the tram station \"Platanenstraße\" (3-5 minutes detour). \\n\\n\\n= Sleeping =\\n\\nThere is a youth hostel in Jena, the cheapest bed is 18€ a night (Jan 2019). Be sure to get there early, because there\\'s no other cheap accommodation in the city. The tram heads there, you should ask somebody for directions. If you get really stuck, the McD\\'s at the service station, although not 24h is open until midnight, and opens again 7 the next morning. If you leave McD\\'s at midnight, cross the road, and climb the stairs opposite the car dealership on the back of the warehouse, there\\'s a sheltered area where you can camp for the night. It\\'s not warm, but if you go into McD\\'s the next morning, you can use the bathroom to wash, and somebody behind the counter might recognize you and sort you out with a cup of tea. Couchsurfing and Hospitality Club are also very active in Jena.\\nThe only shop open 24/7 in Jena is a \"Backwerk\" right at Löbdergraben in the city centre.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n__NOTOC__\\n{{IsIn|Thuringia}}\\n\\n[[Category:Thuringia]]\\n[[Category:Germany]]\\n\\n[[de:Jena]]',\n",

Reudnitz kommt.|Craig]] at Maale Adumim Junction en route to Dead Sea (5 mins).]]\\n[Moriya:] Jerusalem has at least 6-7 roads to get out,to different directions. It\\'s changes often by the massive constractions but in general, choose your next destination and ask local where the best spot to hitch out. the following is list of spots based on the direction:\\n\\n\\n== MAIN Junction to get out: ==\\n\"Hayeziaa Me\\'A\\'ir\"- The enternace of the city, called as well Ginot Sacharov. ([https://goo.gl/maps/i8hDtLdz8tu Google street view]) 1 road, the huge Trempiyada that close to the CBS. it\\'s the road to Tel Aviv, Haifa and all Gush Dan, and the way to the states highways- 2, 6.. If you come from city center, you walk through tram lines to the ugly bridge, and down the bridge you continue straight.you will see 2 crossroads and on your right will be to petrols stations- yellow one and one call Sonol. Keep staright. you will see huge place to stand, bus statins and often tons of people that hitch hike too. find your spot and stand. Most likely you will see other hitchhikers standing there too. If you get bored or want to burn some time, just behind you there is an old Arab village (Lifta), which was deserted in 1948. Go down the stairs and find your way to the local spring. Although basicly from this spot people go to all the country, not many people stop, and you may stuck inside all the traffic jams. So if you want easyer, beautyer and often shorter way to south or north, use another way. \\n\\nHitch hike to Tel Aviv on road 443: You can stand at French Hill just in the other side of the tram of Givat Hamivtar. This is not the best spot to hitch towards Tel Aviv - use it only if you hitched here from the Dead Sea, northern Israel or from the West bank, and you wish to continue to Tel Aviv. On the other side of the big intersection there is a smaller bus stop. Cars that pass here might be going into Jerusalem, or towards Tel Aviv through highway 1 or highway 443, so a sign here can be a big help. There are no good places to stop on highway 1 except the  Hemed station and Latrun intersection.  It’s better to wait for a direct ride. If you can get a ride part of the way on highway 443, to Modiin for example, that is much better, because there are bus stops in almost every intersection on that road.\\n\\n== To the north, south and Dead sea: ==\\n\\nJerusalem locate, geographicly in the excat center of Israel, which explaines why to hitch hike to nirth and south is the same spot. for years, the best way was through the Trempiyada in French hill, but roads changed and people barely stop there nowdays .(2018) Currently spot is the station to Maa\\'le Adumim that close to the Hebrew Uni. From city center- take the tram to Ammunition Hill, \\'\\'or\\'\\' you hitchhike from in front the Damascus gate (sounds strange, but worked numerous times: 10 mins, 5 mins). Get down, cross the road to the right, you can see huge white stutue on your left. Keep it on your left.  and start walk, You will walk like 15 minutes. Than you will see station that have many buses that stop. Check if it\\'s written that there is a bus that go to Kfar Adumim. if the answer iis yes- than you are in the right staation. Take a lift to Kfar Adumim (or further) you will pass Maale Adumim, and Mishor Adumim. when you get down, you will see that you are in road 1#. all the lifts good for you, try to get to Bet Haarava junction, where road 1 meets highway 90, which can take you north towards Beit She\\'an, Tiberias and generally northern Israel (serving also Allenby border crossing and Sheikh Hussein border crossing to Amman) and south towards the Dead Sea and Eilat.\\nSo if you need to get to the Dead Sea and your ride goes to northern Israel (Beit She\\'an, Tiberias etc.) or vice versa, get off at the last junction before Beit HaArava - at Almog junction. Almog junction functions as a refreshment stop, so kiosks, mini-market and (free) toilets are available here, so that\\'s the best way to hitch another ride. Beware! this is a desert area, so being near a refreshment stop helps.\\n\\n== To the west bank- north area: Binyamin and Samaria sttelments, Nablus and cet: ==\\n\\nCheck the section of [[west bank]] for more detalis, but anyways, from Jerusalem: French Hill used to be the best spots, but it\\'s changed (2018). Nowdays the Trempiyada is in Hizma Junction. take the tram to Sayert Duchifat (almost last station), get down and take the crossroad to your right. there is a station, not so good spot but for lazy people you can hitch hike there insted of walk 20 minutes down in the road to Hizma junction. every lift is good to Hizma Junction, and sometime you will get lift straight to your destination. Hizma Junction is a soldiers checkpoint, you will see many people standing there. Sign can help and watch the que.The people that stop will be 90% of the time religius setllers, so if you want to go to Rammalla cheeck where excatly you need to get down to coninue, and be aware that people will not like the idea you go there, and can\\'t give you ride straight to there, due the politics issues. You can hitch from the same place towards Ramallah (and from there you can reach Nablus and other Palestinian cities). Be advised that if you’re standing in this stop with a sign that says “Ramallah” on it, it\\'s quite possible people are going to look at you like you’re crazy, and might try to convince you not to go there, that it’s dangerous, etc. \\nIt\\'s almost secret but you can even hitch hike to Netania, Tel Aviv, Haifa from this stop if you heading to Samaria (through 60 road, 5, 6) but it longer and you will need many lifts. Rides from here are available to the Ramallah area ([[Ramallah]], [[Ofra]], etc.) As well as further in, towards [[Nablus]], via \"Tapuach Junction\" ([[Ariel]], [[Salfit]], [[Buddya]] etc.)\\nThe buses to this area are really cheap (sometime 3 shekels!) so check where you need exactly to go and your time- maybe bus is better..\\n\\n== To the west bank- south- Gush Ezyon, Hebron, Beer Sheva ==\\n\\nSame rules about the [[west bank]] section. \\n\\nTake bus to Gilo (71, 31, 30..) get down in Afarsemon street. cross to the left, you will see huge road, on the left there is Trempiyada. If you need to Go to Hebron, ask people where exactly to stand. If you not sure where to get down ask the driver, where is the Gush Ezyon\\'s Trempiyada.\\n\\n \\nTo Tekoa (Gush Ezyon) : take the bus to Har Homa (Homat Shmuel) 74, 75. Get down in Shmuel Meir-Kvish 378. It\\'s the same way to Bet Lechem, but Israelies car not aloud to go there, and arabs not aloud to do the way around.A bus ride to Bethlehem only costs 8 NIS, consider using the bus. Bus #231 or #234 can be taken from the bus terminal in front of Damscus gate of the Old City of Jerusalem. You can hitch a ride to  [[Gush Etzion Junction]] and continue from there to most of the villages in Gush Etzion or on to Hebron and Kiryat Arba.\\n\\n\\nThough, to get to the Hebron or Kiryat Arba, there is a bus #381 which costs just 8.1 NIS. \\n\\n\\nYou can consider to walk instead of HH. Jerusalem to Bethlem is just 8 km. I\\'ve done it in less than 2 hours walking slow and take my time. The view is not the best but if you arrive walking you will able to see the big wall which it separetes Israel to the West Bank. You have to take the entrance for tourists,very fast, few people pass there. The palestinian pass by another gate. Above all you will see the wall and read the different stories of the palestinian during the occupation and you will see many grafitti on the wall, some of them were made by Bansky. Bansky\\'s graffitti are spread around Jerusalem but if you go to the center the (annoyng) taxies will take you to a tour to see Bansky\\'s graffiti.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n[[Category:\\n\\n[[Category:Palestinian Territory]]',\n",

If you come from city center, you walk through tram lines to the ugly bridge, and down the bridge you continue straight.you will see 2 crossroads and on your right will be to petrols stations- yellow one and one call Sonol. Keep staright. you will see huge place to stand, bus statins and often tons of people that hitch hike too. find your spot and stand. Most likely you will see other hitchhikers standing there too. If you get bored or want to burn some time, just behind you there is an old Arab village (Lifta), which was deserted in 1948. Go down the stairs and find your way to the local spring. Although basicly from this spot people go to all the country, not many people stop, and you may stuck inside all the traffic jams. So if you want easyer, beautyer and often shorter way to south or north, use another way. \\n\\nHitch hike to Tel Aviv on road 443: You can stand at French Hill just in the other side of the tram of Givat Hamivtar. This is not the best spot to hitch towards Tel Aviv - use it only if you hitched here from the Dead Sea, northern Israel or from the West bank, and you wish to continue to Tel Aviv. On the other side of the big intersection there is a smaller bus stop. Cars that pass here might be going into Jerusalem, or towards Tel Aviv through highway 1 or highway 443, so a sign here can be a big help. There are no good places to stop on highway 1 except the  Hemed station and Latrun intersection.  It’s better to wait for a direct ride. If you can get a ride part of the way on highway 443, to Modiin for example, that is much better, because there are bus stops in almost every intersection on that road.\\n\\n== To the north, south and Dead sea: ==\\n\\nJerusalem locate, geographicly in the excat center of Israel, which explaines why to hitch hike to nirth and south is the same spot. for years, the best way was through the Trempiyada in French hill, but roads changed and people barely stop there nowdays .(2018) Currently spot is the station to Maa\\'le Adumim that close to the Hebrew Uni. From city center- take the tram to Ammunition Hill, \\'\\'or\\'\\' you hitchhike from in front the Damascus gate (sounds strange, but worked numerous times: 10 mins, 5 mins). Get down, cross the road to the right, you can see huge white stutue on your left. Keep it on your left.  and start walk, You will walk like 15 minutes. Than you will see station that have many buses that stop. Check if it\\'s written that there is a bus that go to Kfar Adumim. if the answer iis yes- than you are in the right staation. Take a lift to Kfar Adumim (or further) you will pass Maale Adumim, and Mishor Adumim. when you get down, you will see that you are in road 1#. all the lifts good for you, try to get to Bet Haarava junction, where road 1 meets highway 90, which can take you north towards Beit She\\'an, Tiberias and generally northern Israel (serving also Allenby border crossing and Sheikh Hussein border crossing to Amman) and south towards the Dead Sea and Eilat.\\nSo if you need to get to the Dead Sea and your ride goes to northern Israel (Beit She\\'an, Tiberias etc.) or vice versa, get off at the last junction before Beit HaArava - at Almog junction. Almog junction functions as a refreshment stop, so kiosks, mini-market and (free) toilets are available here, so that\\'s the best way to hitch another ride. Beware! this is a desert area, so being near a refreshment stop helps.\\n\\n== To the west bank- north area: Binyamin and Samaria sttelments, Nablus and cet: ==\\n\\nCheck the section of [[west bank]] for more detalis, but anyways, from Jerusalem: French Hill used to be the best spots, but it\\'s changed (2018). Nowdays the Trempiyada is in Hizma Junction. take the tram to Sayert Duchifat (almost last station), get down and take the crossroad to your right. there is a station, not so good spot but for lazy people you can hitch hike there insted of walk 20 minutes down in the road to Hizma junction. every lift is good to Hizma Junction, and sometime you will get lift straight to your destination. Hizma Junction is a soldiers checkpoint, you will see many people standing there. Sign can help and watch the que.The people that stop will be 90% of the time religius setllers, so if you want to go to Rammalla cheeck where excatly you need to get down to coninue, and be aware that people will not like the idea you go there, and can\\'t give you ride straight to there, due the politics issues. You can hitch from the same place towards Ramallah (and from there you can reach Nablus and other Palestinian cities). Be advised that if you’re standing in this stop with a sign that says “Ramallah” on it, it\\'s quite possible people are going to look at you like you’re crazy, and might try to convince you not to go there, that it’s dangerous, etc. \\nIt\\'s almost secret but you can even hitch hike to Netania, Tel Aviv, Haifa from this stop if you heading to Samaria (through 60 road, 5, 6) but it longer and you will need many lifts. Rides from here are available to the Ramallah area ([[Ramallah]], [[Ofra]], etc.) As well as further in, towards [[Nablus]], via \"Tapuach Junction\" ([[Ariel]], [[Salfit]], [[Buddya]] etc.)\\nThe buses to this area are really cheap (sometime 3 shekels!) so check where you need exactly to go and your time- maybe bus is better..\\n\\n== To the west bank- south- Gush Ezyon, Hebron, Beer Sheva ==\\n\\nSame rules about the [[west bank]] section. \\n\\nTake bus to Gilo (71, 31, 30..) get down in Afarsemon street. cross to the left, you will see huge road, on the left there is Trempiyada. If you need to Go to Hebron, ask people where exactly to stand. If you not sure where to get down ask the driver, where is the Gush Ezyon\\'s Trempiyada.\\n\\n \\nTo Tekoa (Gush Ezyon) : take the bus to Har Homa (Homat Shmuel) 74, 75. Get down in Shmuel Meir-Kvish 378. It\\'s the same way to Bet Lechem, but Israelies car not aloud to go there, and arabs not aloud to do the way around.A bus ride to Bethlehem only costs 8 NIS, consider using the bus. Bus #231 or #234 can be taken from the bus terminal in front of Damscus gate of the Old City of Jerusalem. You can hitch a ride to  [[Gush Etzion Junction]] and continue from there to most of the villages in Gush Etzion or on to Hebron and Kiryat Arba.\\n\\n\\nThough, to get to the Hebron or Kiryat Arba, there is a bus #381 which costs just 8.1 NIS. \\n\\n\\nYou can consider to walk instead of HH. Jerusalem to Bethlem is just 8 km. I\\'ve done it in less than 2 hours walking slow and take my time. The view is not the best but if you arrive walking you will able to see the big wall which it separetes Israel to the West Bank. You have to take the entrance for tourists,very fast, few people pass there. The palestinian pass by another gate. Above all you will see the wall and read the different stories of the palestinian during the occupation and you will see many grafitti on the wall, some of them were made by Bansky. Bansky\\'s graffitti are spread around Jerusalem but if you go to the center the (annoyng) taxies will take you to a tour to see Bansky\\'s graffiti.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n[[Category:\\n\\n[[Category:Palestinian Territory]]'},\n",

Then you\\'ll see a railway station \"Jihlava-Bosch Diesel\", so go there, jump over the rails and you\\'ll see approach road. Then continue to the right on this approach road and after 1km theres a bridge and slip-road to the highway D1. Before the bridge is one for Brno direction, and after the bridge for Prague direction. Theres much space enough to stop.\\n\\n==== Second option ====\\nTake the bus number 12 and get out on bus stop \"Pávov,II\", then take the same way to the gas station as I write about in \"hitching in\" section.\\n\\n==== Third option ====\\nTested for Prague several times (sign \"Praha\" or \"PHA\"). Find main bus station, then walk little bit more to (trolley-)bus stop \"U městských domů\". Most of cars go probably different direction but it saves you lot of time because you don\\'t have to approach the highway (6 km from the centre) and you don\\'t have to use public transport (it\\'s not so big city for walking).\\n\\n=== South towards [[Znojmo]], [[Vienna]] {{National Road Number Czech Republic|38}}{{E|59}} ===\\nTake trolleybus \"A\" to the stop \"Brtnická ul.\". Then go few meters back to the other main road (Znojemská street) and continue on foot. After 500 meters there will be an OMV gas station, but it is best continue another 500 meters to the BENZINA gas station which is a good point for stopping a car on the E59. If you\\'ll wait there a very long time, continue on the road until you reach the crossroads with the bypass around Jihlava, where more cars join the road towards Vienna.\\n\\n== Hitching in ==\\n=== By highway from any direction ===\\nTheres a big gas station OMV right before the exit to Jihlava on the highway, so try to stop here if the driver is not going directly to Jihlava. It is about 7 km from the highway to the city. Then go to the end of the gas station (as you would like to continue to Brno direction) and you will see forest and small path, so go this way. After 1.5 km you\\'ll see a small village called Nový Pávov where there is the bus stop \"Pávov,II\" for the Jihlava public transportation system (ticket is for 16 krones, about 0.60€). Wait for bus number 12, which goes to the centre (the bus stop for the main square is \"Masarykovo nám.horní\").\\n\\n\\'\\'For me was always much better to continue with driver to Jihlava exit. It is safe to stop there. And you will go just down and hitchhike at the ramp. I always waited only few minutes and went directly to Jihlava (various parts). At that OMV gas station I stuck once and after an hour walked in the forest to that ramp. - [[User:Kundrt|Kundrt]]\\'\\'\\n\\n== Accommodation and Sleep and Other Useful Info ==\\nFeel free to contact [http://www.couchsurfing.org/people/mazi_mazi/ Mazi Mazi] on Couchsurfing: \\n\\n\\n{{Cities Czech Republic}}\\n{{Highways CZ}}\\n\\n__NOTOC__\\t\\n\\n[[Category:Czech Republic]]\\n[[Category:E50]]\\n[[Category:E59]]\\n[[Category:E65]]',\n",

Continue straight until you see a small street along some fields, at one point you will see a ramp with a bump on the left going to the highway. Follow it and you will be in the tollgate. Is a nice spot but '''I was kicked out of the tollgate''' by a grumpy guy, another employee politely asked me to go down the highway. So I hitchhike in the main avenue[http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=35.16162&mlon=128.11695#map=17/35.16162/128.11695], just where I have started.

The buses leave on the north-east corner of the market square, at the crossing of \\'\\'Siltakatu\\'\\' and \\'\\'Kauppakatu\\'\\'. Notice that the buses run about once an hour or even more infrequently! It takes about 30 minutes to get to \\'\\'Reijola\\'\\', you can ask the driver for help. There\\'s a petrol station on the left side at the crossing of \\'\\'Vanha Valtatie/Reijolanraitti\\'\\' and \\'\\'Joensuuntie\\'\\'/Highway 6. Hop off here! You can either ask the drivers at the petrol station or go to a bus stop at the crossing (if the petrol station is behind you, to the left is Joensuu and to the right is Lappeenranta).\\n\\nThe two first ramps south of the river to the highway No.6 heading south also work well enough.\\nSpecially when heading towards Russia it is good to go to the parking lot of \"Prisma\" (big shopping centre at 2nd exit of highway no.6, North of the river) and ask drivers of Russian vehicles. They like shopping there and you might be able to offer a few free \"custom-kilos\" in return.\\n\\n=== West towards [[Kuopio]] (\"Kuopiontie\", road 17) ===\\n\\nThe street called \\'\\'Siltakatu\\'\\' right in the center of Joensuu will bring you to the hitching spot. Walk westwards, to the opposite direction of the train station and the river, until you reach \\'\\'Länsikatu\\'\\', which crosses \\'\\'Siltakatu\\'\\'. Walk right and cross \\'\\'Länsikatu\\'\\'. Take the sandy walking path (the road is on the left side and a school on the right) and keep on walking for some while. There\\'s a bus stop on the left (a path takes you there). If you reach \\'\\'Heinäpurontie\\'\\' or \\'\\'Kaislakatu\\'\\', you\\'ve walked too far. The problem with this place might be that there\\'s a lot of traffic inside the city. \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Another option\\'\\'\\' is to go further away from the center. Take the bus number 2 to \\'\\'\\'Marjala\\'\\'\\' leaving in front of the Taidemuseo (museum). The buses run about twice an hour. Ask the driver to leave you at \\'\\'\\'Marjalantie\\'\\'\\'. Walk to the same direction as the bus goes. Turn left after a couple of hundred meters later, walk past an ABC petrol station (open 24h, café, restaurant, free toilets, moderate priced grocery store) and cross the bridge over the highway. Walk down the small hillside to the shoulder of the road. I\\'ve usually hitch hiked under the bridge (comes in handy if it\\'s raining) or right before it. You can also ask some drivers at the petrol station mentioned above.\\n\\n=== South-West towards [[Varkaus]], [[Jyväskylä]], [[Tampere]], [[Mikkeli]], [[Helsinki]] (the road number 23) ===\\n\\nThe starting place as going westwards. About 25 kilometers after Joensuu, take the road number 23, which turns left (towards Varkaus). In Varkaus: To go to Jyväskylä or Tampere, stay on the road number 23. To go to Helsinki, take the highway 5 towards south (towards Mikkeli). \\n\\nWhen going to \\'\\'\\'Helsinki\\'\\'\\' or \\'\\'\\'Lahti\\'\\'\\', it seems more logical to take the road #6, which leaves southwards, than go through Varkaus to #5. Both of the routes have their pros and cons; #6 is a more quiet road compared to the #5. Nevertheless it\\'s not impossible to get to Helsinki or Lahti by taking #6. On #5 you might have to hh on-ramps or other not-that-suitable hitchhike spots while on #6 there are a plenty of bus stops every once in a while. If you\\'re in a hurry, take #5 (Varkaus) but if you\\'ve got more time, #6 goes through some pretty typical Finnish landscapes and just less than 10 kilometers from the Russian border! If you end up choosing #6, see the hitchhike spot when going to Lappeenranta.\\n__NOTOC__\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|Finland}}\\n\\n[[Category:Finland]]\\n\\n[[fi:Joensuu]]\\n[[trash:Joensuu]]',\n",

The country is not too big and if you are really in hurry you can cross it - even with hitchhiking - from North to South on one day. The roads are not the best, but usually the mainroads between the big cities and the main sights are quite fine.\\nIn general it is very easy to hitchhike in Jordan. The people are very friendly, they always try to help out foreigners.\\n\\nIf you are standing next to the street and show some attention to a coming driver most of the times he will already stop for you. You can also just wave to him or point with your forefinger down to the earth. Try to avoid stoping cars with your thumb - it is more sign for sex workers. But I think the people will understand you anyway. Some drivers stop for you even if they don\\'t go your direction just to say \\'welcome\\' or to get to know your name, origin and destination.\\nThe best way is to stand at a junction outside of the city and point into the direction you want to go.\\n\\nOnce you have a ride, some drivers won\\'t even let you out until they have stopped another car which is going your direction. More and more Jordanians speak at least a bit English, of course, but not everybody. Some Arabic is never bad - but with the name of a city most of the people understand you. In the worst - or funniest - case they will give you their phone with some relatives or friends on the other side who have a little more idea of English, French or German.\\n\\nIn a lot of parts of the country, especially in the south there are not even buses or any other public transport (p.e. from the main road to Wadi Rum). So hitchhiking is sometimes even for the local people to get around. Most of the times the drivers expect you to pay. In the cities there are also a lot of private people trying to make taxi business with you. If you really don\\'t want to spend money for your ride - and it is possible! - stay strong. \"No money\" or \"No taxi\" understands everybody. Just make it sure when you get into the car. Your best bet is to try to stop lorries - they are usually going far and they don\\'t seem to care about money. If it is too hard to get out of the town walk it, a taxi driver will try to bring you all the way to your destination; it is very common to go by taxi long distance - but not necessary in this paradise of hitchhiking!\\n\\n== Safety ==\\nIn general the Jordanians are very friendly, helpful and respectful to male foreigners. Just make sure it is clear where you want to go and what they can expect from you. But I had never bad experiences. Most of the time they even offer you money or invite you to their family for dinner.\\nThere are many checkpoints where sometimes your ID will be checked. If you only hold an Israeli passport it\\'s probably not a good idea to [[hitchhiking at night|hitchhike at night]].\\n\\nA lot of locals are not repectful to female foreigners and behave like perverts (expect to be kissed and touched by sellers in shops, car drivers, couchsurfing hosts even if your boyfriend is standing next to you). See more details in \\'\\'\\'Personal experiences\\'\\'\\' section\\n\\n== Get in ==\\nVisas are obtainable at land borders. Usually you get a visa for one months. You will have to say, what are you planning to do and what is the first place where you are staying. If you want to stay longer you can extend it in any police station. For more information contact your embassy or research in the internet.\\nPeople from Arab countries don\\'t need a visa.\\n\\nAqaba has free special economic zone visa. If you arrived by plane in Amman you can get free visa, like in Aqaba, if you tell border officer that you are going to Aqaba and want ASEZA visa, but you must register in Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority office (29.55884047696434, 35.02046203276475) in 48 hours. Go to window #18: \"Residency permit renewal\". When you will leave country they may ask you registration paper. If you do not have it you might be fined - every day in Jordan might be counted as overstay.\\n\\n== Cities ==\\n* [[Amman]]\\n* [[Jerash]]\\n* [[Irbid]]\\n* [[Petra]]\\n* [[Ramtha]]\\n* [[Wadi Rum]]\\n\\n== Locations ==\\n* [[Dead Sea (Jordan)]]\\n\\n== Border crossings ==\\nThere are 2 border crossings to [[Israel]] and one to occupied [[Palestine]]. There are also land crossings to [[Syria]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Iraq]]. However, as of January 2015, the Syria and Iraq borders are closed indefinitely.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Aqaba Border Crossing to and from Israel\\'\\'\\'\\nTo get to the Border Crossing in Aqaba it is quite hard. Either you have a map and try to find it walking. It is at least 5 km from the mainroad. Best way is to take a taxi from downtown. Don\\'t pay more than 3-5 dinar. On the Israeli side it is just 2 km to the mainroad between Eilat (another 5 km) and Jerusalem (300 km) and the Dead Sea (250 km)\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Jordan River Border Crossing to and from Israel\\'\\'\\'\\nYou won\\'t be allowed to cross this border crossing on foot. Maybe you are lucky and you can discuss with the soldiers but I wouldn\\'t be sure. Usually there are busses just for crossing the river which marks the border between Jordan and Israel. On both sides it is just 2.5 km to the mainroad (Jordanien side) or the next village (Israeli side) from where you will be able to get a ride.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Allenby/King Hussein Bridge Border Crossing to and from Israel/Palestinian Authority\\'\\'\\'\\nThis border crossing is significantly more difficult and tedious than the other two crossings, as this crossing serves Palestinians who go to/from the Palestinian Autonomy areas. It is common for travelers to be subjected to several-hour waits, intense interrogation (including searches of journals, phones, and computers). From Amman, a taxi may be taken to the crossing for 10 dinar. It also may be possible to hitchhike to the border, but the taxi is a much more certain option. To get from the Jordanian border control point to the Israeli one, travelers are required to pay 10 dinar for a spot on a bus, with luggage costing an additional fee. If you are lucky enough to be allowed entry into Israel/Palestinian Autonomy, you will need to pay to board another bus from the border to either Jerusalem (and from there to the rest of Israel) or to Jericho (a Palestinian city).\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n== Personal experiences ==\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Experience in June 2022\\'\\'\\' - [[User:Falcor|Falcor]] We (F+M couple) successfully hitched around Jordan (Amman, Petra, Tafila, Dead Sea, Madaba) in June 2022. Unlike the previous experiences expressed below, our experience was of very welcoming and respectful people, who were very generous and keen to help. Most people were happy and curious to meet travellers from Australia.\\n\\nWe suspect the unfortunate experiences expressed below may have been a rare exception, as our experiences were quite the opposite. No one tried any inappropriate touching, kissing or hugging!\\n\\nFrom what we saw, foreign hitch-hikers are not so common in Jordan and people often assumed we wanted a bus or an informal taxi service (\"I\\'ll take you for 5JD\"), or perhaps simply that we were lost and needed help. Still, we got rides from a wide variety of folks, including truck drivers, farmers (complete with goats in the back of the pickup), students, a tour guide,\\xa0a security guard, foreign workers, and foreign\\xa0tourists. We did not expect to get picked up much by cars with muslim women, but did get a ride from a young family with a baby on board.\\n\\nFollowing common advice to travellers in middle eastern countries, he did most of the talking and sat next to the driver when appropriate. She felt a bit invisible with some of the more conservative folks, but that was rare.\\n\\nWe experienced no disrespectful or inappropriate behaviour. Throughout our travels, we found people incredibly polite (even hawkers accepted the first \\'No thanks\\' and wished us \\'Welcome to Jordan\\' with a smile). People were keen to know we were having a good time in Jordan, they often drove us a bit out of their way, and they often offered us additional help, food and drink.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Experience in February 2022\\'\\'\\' - [[User:Z-z-z88|Z-z-z88]] I hitch-hiked with my girlfriend, in general people are friendly and speak English, but there are a lot of perverts. Our couchsurfing host tried to kiss my girlfriend into lips in front of his friends and I was just 3 meters away, then he asked me if he can have sex with my girlfriend or watch how me and my girlfriend have sex. \\n\\nDuring hitch-hiking drivers ask me if we are married, I confirm that, then as soon as I go out of car drivers tried to kiss my girlfriend and used force to hug and touch.\\nSome driver quickly kissed my girlfriend into neck when we started walking away, I was 1 meter away from them.\\n\\nSame thing happens in shops, sellers try to touch and kiss while I stand in 0.5 meters from my girlfriend. She was wearing regular traveller clothes - winter pants, jacket, she had big backpack with attached mattress.\\n\\nNow I understand why in their culture they do not allow anyone to see their sisters and daughters. Houses are divided in male and female parts with separate toilets and showers, so nobody can\\'t see even shadow of girls. These meausures are necessary in society where almost everyone will try to kiss/touch girl.\\n\\n[[Category:Middle East]]\\n\\n[[tr:Ürdün]]',\n",

Take the tram '''1''', '''2''', '''S4''' or '''S5''' to ''Weinweg''. There is a petrol station close by where you can ask people, or you can stand nearby the exit of the petrol station - around 10 meters away from it. There is a safe place where the people can turn off behind you. You can also stand directly on the ramp, waving a sign or a thumb. The hard shoulder serves enough space for anyone to stop, but the cars go a little fast.\\n__TOC__\\n\\n==== Option 2 ====\\nNear [[Bruchsal]], there is a very huge service area at the [[A5 (Germany)|A5]]. It's about 40 minutes by tram and bus and the fare is 3 EUR. See [[Bruchsal]] for details.\\n\\n==== Option 3 ====\\nThere is a service station in [[Baden-Baden]], 30 km south of Karlsruhe. Be aware that this station is only situated on the southbound side. From Karlsruhe this is about a 45 minute journey with public transport or a 1.5 journey if you have to walk from the station in Baden-Baden. See [[Baden-Baden]] for details.\\n\\n\\n''Cholopacker: despicted the fact that takes time to get to Option 3, I think is the best option if going South to Freiburg, Switzerland or Lyon (but not throught Switzerland), once here I found a ride quite fast to the last gas station before Freiburg and then to France.''\\n\\n=== Direction South, West, East {{Autobahn|5}} {{Autobahn|8}} {{Autobahn|65}} {{E|35}} {{E|52}} ===\\nThe Bus Station ''Beiertheim West'' makes a good hitchhiking spot in direction south ([[A5 (Germany)|A5]], [[Basel]]) but there are also many cars going in direction [[Stuttgart]] or [[Landau]].\\nIt is served by the bus no. 062 from ''Hauptbahnhof'' or ''Entenfang'', but you can also take tram no. 2 to ''Welfenstraße'' or just walk 10 minutes from the main train station along ''Ebertstraße''.\\n\\nUpdate August 2016: I tried to go to Strasbourg but had the impression that nobody goes there by this way. That's why I went by tram S5 from Europaplatz to Wörth Bahnhof and took the train to Lauterbourg, so passing the border by train. The secondary road in Lauterbourg leads to the A35 and it was quite easy from there to get a lift. Even if not every car goes directly to Strabourg they will take you some kms and you are going to be in Strasbourg quite quick (or at least in my case it worked well).\\nUpdate November 2019: still works well by train to Lauterbourg and then hitchhiking south to Strasbourg via Highway A35. There was'nt even a ticket checker in the train to Lauterbourg (when you enter, check if there's someone else with an uniform besides the traindriver or in the backcabin. anyway the train goes only 20min from Wörth to L.bourg)\\n\\n\\nFollowing the aforementioned advice, I tried in 2022 with a friend and in Lauterbourg, the roundabout near the petrol station worked great despite the fact that there was no room for cars to stop. I can also confirm the absence of ticket checkers in the (very old and small) train from Wörth to Lauterbourg.\\n\\n[[File:Karlsruhe-Schloss-meph666-2005-Apr-22.jpg|thumb|right|365px|Castle of Karlsruhe]]\\n\\n== Hitching in ==\\nIf your driver is not going to Karlsruhe, but only passing it on the A5/A8, there is no really good place to get dropped. All the motorway exits are big junctions where it's not possible to enter the motorway again directly. \\nThe most practical place are probably the exits ''Zentrum'' and ''Durlach''. You driver will loose about 5 minutes, but you will get dropped right next to a tram station that is served 24/7 (10 minutes journey to the city center).\\n\\n== Resources ==\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n[[wikipedia:Karlsruhe]]\\n\\n[[Category:Baden-Württemberg]]\\n[[Category:Germany]]\\n[[Category:E35]]\\n[[Category:E52]]\\n\\n[[de:Karlsruhe]]\\n[[fr:Karlsruhe]]\",\n",

The street leads direct to the motorway and has a bus bay. A sign \\'\\'GÖ\\'\\' is absolutely necessary, signs with other placenames lead to a very long waiting time. The first service station is [[Göttingen Ost]], the ramp of Göttingen is also good for hitchhiking.\\n\\n=== East towards ([[Halle (Saale)]], [[Leipzig]]), {{Ade|38}} ===\\n\\nNot tested yet: also from the bus stop \\'\\'Dahlheimer Weg\\'\\'. The first service station at the {{Ade|38}} is [[Rohnetal Süd]] between [[Sangerhausen]] and Eisleben. For [[Halle (Saale)]] there is no direct exit on the A38. For Leipzig it is best to leave the Autobahn at the junction Leipzig-Südwest.\\n\\n=== East towards ([[Eisenach]], [[Erfurt]], [[Eschwege]]), B7, {{Ade|4}} ===\\n\\nTake the trams 4 or 8 to the stop \\'\\'Am Kupferhammer\\'\\' and then follow the main street. Behind the next traffic lights is a good place, a sign is helpful. There are rarely intermediate stops possible on this road, only at Hessisch Lichtenau\\n\\nIf you want to go onto the {{Ade|4}} and you don\\'t get a ride further then Eisenach, ask your driver not to take the \\'\\'Bundesstraße\\'\\' B7 but the B400 via Wommen, so you can reach the service station [[Eisenach Nord]]. If you get a lift only to Oetmannshausen, you have to walk the Bundesstraße to the south for 1,5 kilometers to the next bus stop, where there is another good place to hitchhike.\\n\\n=== South towards ([[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Fulda]]), {{Ade|7}} ===\\n\\nTake the trams 5 or 6 or the buses 25 or 27 to the stop \\'\\'Auestadion\\'\\'. You will see the street to the motorway, follow it for 400 meters on the right, there is a bus stop with a bay.

The first service station on the {{Ade|7}} is [[Hasselberg West]].(this is a good place for cars to stop but be warned i waited in this spot for two hours before getting a ride)\\n\\n=== South towards ([[Marburg]]), {{Ade|49}} ===\\n\\nSame as above. Behind Baunatal on the {{Ade|49}} there is a petrol station, but it is not good for hitchhiking. Better you take only cars which go until the exit \\'\\'Bad Zwesten\\'\\', there does the Bundesstraße 3 begin. At Auestadion a sign is absolutely necessary (\\'\\'MR\\'\\').\\n\\n=== West towards ([[Dortmund]], [[Paderborn]], [[Bielefeld]]), {{Ade|44}} ===\\n\\nTake one of the buses 51, 52, 53 or 55 to the stop \\'\\'Birkenkopf\\'\\' and follow the street until the traffic lights. There on the onramp is a good place. An ideal place for going west. But also for other directions this place is good, because from some parts of the city it is easier to catch the motorway here. The first petrol station on the {{Ade|44}}, [[Bühleck Nord]], is bad for hitchhiking, take the next one, [[Am Biggenkopf Nord]]. If you want to go more far than Dortmund it is much better to take a sign \\'\\'DO\\'\\' and go to the service station [[Am Haarstrang Nord]] and change the sign there.\\n\\n== Service stations Kassel ==\\n\\nThe service stations of Kassel are reachable by the bus 38. Take the bus until the stop \\'\\'Bergshausen, Neckarweg\\'\\'. From there go the street along for one kilometer. Behind the motorway on the right is the service station [[Kassel Ost]], which is {{good}} for hitchhiking, but it is only possible to ask the drivers at the petrol station, but beneath the {{Ade|7}} you also can get lifts for the {{Ade|38}}. A resthouse also exists, but there it is {{senseless}}. The service station [[Kassel West]] has been closed and there doesn\\'t exist a possibility to hitchhike to the south ({{senseless}})!\\n\\n== Public Transport ==\\n\\nSingle tickets cost in Kassel City 2,60 € and for Bergshausen in the ticket zone Kassel plus 3,40 € (as of 2013).

It is also spelled Харкiв in Ukranian and Харьков in Russian. Note that if you search Google maps you will only get the right location upon entering ‘Kharkov’.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n=== East towards [[Russia]] ===\\n\\nFind the metro and make it to Derzhprom/Держпром (Gosprom/Госпром in Russian) station, which is a trasfer station between the Saltivska and Olexiyivska lines and 3 stops away from the Train Station (Пiвденний Вокзал). Ask around for a minibus to Piatikhatka (Пятихатка) — it normally stops just in the same place. Attention, the minibus no longers leaves from the Radianska station! The minibus will take you to the remote rural area near the ringroad; exit the vehicle right after it turnes left from the main road. Walk back to the road and walk on some 500 meters to the junction and then a little more up the hill for a good spot or hitch right away — the Russian-Ukranian border is 15 km in front of you.\\n\\nKeep in mind that in the morning and daytime you can also take the buses and the cheap (7 UAH, less than $1) trains over the border going to Russian city [[Belgorod]], to avoid all the extra questions and possible troubles with pedestrian border-crossing. Both leave from the Train Station mentioned above.\\n\\nThe price of one metro ride is 1,5 UAH at the time of writing; the minibus should cost you 2,5. The total is less than $0.5.\\nThe bus over the border should be something close to $5 and you can try to bargain the price down up to 30%. The bus driver should accept Russian roubles and even dollars/euros if you give money directly to him bypassing ticket office; but to pay for everything else you will have to have hrivnas (UAH). \\n\\n=== West towards [[Kyiv]] ===\\n\\nThere is a huge agglomeration west of Kharkiv which goes for at least 15 km on end; if you are already behind the ringroad it may be good idea to take some minibus till it goes off the main road; if the inhabitant area is not over just take another one and repeat the trick. I didn't have UAH when I happened to be there, and I had no intention to go back to the city to change some money so I asked some truck driver who stopped nearby to give me a lift. But it was pure luck to have a truck right there so you better have some local cash in your pocket and take the minibus.\\n\\nIf you are in the city, you might want to take the local train to get outside. Take the metro to the Zavod imeni Malysheva (Завод iм. Малишева) station and find a railway 200 m west of it. Follow the rails south for another 300m and you will find a train station; from there take a train to Korotych (Коротыч) or even to Ogultsy (Огульцы), the road will be 1 km north of the former and 1 km east of the latter.

However, because most of the traffic is local traffic most of the rides will be to nearby towns like Downham Market and Ely, although again these places are easy hitching out of.\\nDon't press the traffic light button constantly to stop traffic and get a warning from a [[police]]man like [[User:Whisperingofthestars|Jass]] did. But that's just common sense.\\n\\n=== North ===\\nFor heading north find the turnoff onto the A47 westbound (signposted Wisbech) and hitch before the dual-carriageway. Wisbech has a history of being a pretty terrible place to hitch in, so avoiding that would be ideal.\\n\\n=== East, [[Norwich]] ===\\nTo head east (towards Norwich) find the turnoff to the A47 eastbound (signposted Norwich). There is a lay-by a few metres onto this road.\\nOr else, for a more countryside-ey route, with nothing but pure local traffic, take the Knight's Hill roundabout exit onto the A148 (from the Hardwick hitch towards Hunstanton, it'll be the second roundabout).\\n\\n\\n\\n== Public Transport ==\\nThere are regular buses from the bus station to what seems like all areas of the town but less frequent to the hardwick roundabout. Also there are regular buses to Hunstanton, Norwich, Peterborough, Cromer and Great Yarmouth.\\nKing's Lynn is also on the WAGN rail link, which goes to London and Cambridge.\\n\\n== Places to Visit ==\\n* Get a bus, or hitch on the A149, to Hunstanton and walk along the beach, past the cliffs, to old Hunstanton beach. The sand dunes are perfect for diving off.\\n* In the middle of nowhere off a country road, find a field [[hitchhiking at night|at night]] and look at the sky. You'll be amazed at it if you've been in a city for a substantial amount of time.\\n* The King's Lynn football team usually have matches on Saturdays, so you may be lucky enough to be able to catch them at The Walks football stadium. The fans can be hilarious for their matches, just watch some of the videos on YouTube.\\n* The Tuesday Market Place was host to the famous witch trial of Margaret Read in 1590. It was reported that, when burnt at the stake, her heart burst and struck a nearby wall which has since been commemmorated with a diamond-shaped brick, with a heart carved in the centre. She allegedly still haunts the Tudor Rose Hotel.\\n\\n== Accommodation and Sleep ==\\n\\n\\nThere are different woodlands around King's Lynn, but the much more peaceful area is towards Hunstanton. In this direction there are miles of woodlands in Sandringham which would satisfy any wild camper's wilderness cravings (except for the noise from the main road), then further along and past Hunstanton there is a beautiful stretch of coastline, called the North Norfolk coast. Along here you can find some of the most deserted beaches in England. There are abandoned buildings which can be used as shelters on Old Hunstanton beach (walk in the direction of Holme) and on Thornham beach (on the island).\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n__NOTOC__\\n\\n[[Category:East of England]]\",\n",

It usually goes 4 times an hour, [[hitchhiking at night|at night]] just once every hour. The ferry is paid per person, price as of november 2015 is E2,90. Payment is done on the ferry, an employee will be walking up to people. That makes it possible to avoid paying if you keep walking around while on the ferry.\\n\\nAsk the people who drive there either while waiting for the ferry or in the little café on the ship. If it is cold or raining you can wait in a heated waiting room until the ferry arrives. This is definitely the best way to get out heading east. If you are heading to [[Munich]], you should also try here. The roads on the south side of the Bodensee are tiny, take ages and the traffic sporadic. Try and get a ride before getting off the other side, then you don\\'t have to pay at all!\\n\\n=== South-East towards [[Austria]], [[Rorschach]], [[Bregenz]]  ===\\nGoing East via A13 there is a round-about opposite of train station \"Kreuzlingen Hafen\". You should be able to see a school nearby. There is plenty of space for a car to pull over. We waited 10 minutes (2 guys).\\n\\n=== West towards [[A81 (Germany)|A81]], [[Singen]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Freiburg]] ===\\nGoing west on the 33 towards the A81 Stuttgart−Singen, the first service area is [[Engen|Rasthof Hegau]] on the A81.\\n\\nThere is a good hitching spot just after the entrance to the Burger King drive thru on the B33 in Konstanz. Take a bus (number 6) to Neuwerk and you will be next to a big orange building. Go behind the building and you will see the main road - this is the B33. Turn right along that road (away from the city centre) and you will see the entrance to the Burger King drive thru. Beyond this, there are many large entrances to the businesses and buildings along the road, which means that there are lots of easy opportunities for cars to stop. Waiting times are fast (normally between 5 and 20mins) and you should wait to get a ride at least to Rasthof Hegau on the A81 as there are not really any other better spots in between. Simply holding a sign saying \"Autobahn\" works the best and this spot is good because it\\'s where all roads meet that are leading out of the city towards the A81. This means you get the maximum amount of traffic possible going in the right direction but they are not going quickly because about 30m further up the road there are some traffic lights. Most people seem to be travelling in the direction of Freiburg so unless you are lucky, you will need to ask to get out at Rasthof Hegau in order to go further in the direction of Stuttgart.\\n\\nThere is a really good spot if you want to go north via the A 81:\\nJust take bus number 11 direction Wollmatingen. Go to the very last station. In case of big luggage you can also ask the driver if he could take you 500m further to his turning point, no regular busstop, but you can save some meters of walking :) Then you just have to follow the road to the big crossing (100m).\\nCross the streets till you are on the other side of the roads, just straight, where the road makes a small turn to the left.\\nAlso the other road looks far bigger, This is the right one which takes you to the B33 and the motorway. The good thing is that you catch all the cars coming from the villages around and the \"ring road\" of Konstanz. 50m after the crossing a small fieldtrack leads into the road, a potential stop-area for your ride! Stay a little in front of it, so that the cars waiting at the lights can see you and that they have enough time to see the stop-area.\\nI´ve hitchhiked fromt there many times, sometimes alone, sometimes with friends, and -no joke- we never waited for more than 5 minutes. It´s quite likely that you can skip Hegau, most of the cars can take you way further (f.e. rest area \"Schönbuch\",right before Stuttgart)\\n\\n\\n== Sleep==\\nIf you\\'re desperate you can sleep at the university\\'s library, which is open 24/7 usually. Yo can get there with the bus line 9.\\n\\n__NOTOC__\\n\\n[[Category:Germany]]\\n\\n[[de:Konstanz]]',\n",

Another place within a walking distance (check the map): You know you're there if you are standing on a bus stop and you can see a yellow sign that says 'Ljubljana-left', 'Olmo-straight', 'some street-right'. If you want to get to [[Trieste]] it's better to have a sign because most of the cars are going towards [[Ljubljana]]. You can also ask for a ride to the first or second petrol station on the motorway and ask drivers who stop there to give you a lift (it worked for us once, when it was really late). This spot is well lit so it's doable to hitch hike from there after dark.\\n\\n=== West towards [[Izola]], [[Portoroz]] ===\\nWe never used this spot because you cannot see it from the round-about in [[Koper]] (check map). We took a bus and were passing by it. It is a bus stop, I can imagine it to be quite alright, the cars were not going too fast. You need to test for yourself if hitch hiking there works. When going to Piran accept lifts to Portoroz - Piran is 2 km away, it's a nice walk.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Croatia]] ===\\nThere's a shopping center, Mercator in the corner of Šmarska Cesta and Dolinska Cesta. You can hitch on a bus stop Šmarska Cesta just before the shopping center or any other bus stop down this road towards Croatia. You don't need a sign as any car going down this road will help you but you can make a sign for Dragonja (the town on the border, there walk across the border and once you are on the Croatian side continue hitching) or Hrvaska (Slovenian spelling)/Hrvatska (Croatian spelling)/HR/Croatia (in the summer would be a good idea because off all the tourists driving). There's also a small gas station next to the shopping mall if you prefer asking people.\\n\\n=== North towards Ankaran (Ancarano) ===\\nTo get on the local road, try hitching after the roundabout at the easternmost tip of Ankaranska cesta, on the road that passes the port from the east. There is a gap in the guardrails where a car can easily stop about fifty metres after the roundabout. The place is well visible but can be scorching hot during summer. We never waited more than 30 minutes for a ride.\\n\\n== Hitching In ==\\nDue to this is a small town, you won't have any problems with hitching in.\\n\\n== Public Transport ==\\nYou will find a Bus terminal and a rail station a bit outside of the town. There are regular busses going to [[Trieste]].\\n\\n== Places to Visit ==\\n* Sankt-Nazarius-Cathedral\\n* The old town\\n\\n== Places to Avoid ==\\nKoper is generally very safe.\\n\\n== Accommodation and Sleep ==\\n\\n== Other Useful Info ==\\n{{IsIn|Slovenia}}\\n\\n[[Category:Slovenia]]\",\n",

Then continue walking on the road going south, in the opposite direction from the city center -- this is the only road to Hungary)-- or take tram 4 for two more stops. After walking for a while you will see on your right a large statue of the Pope, with a nice empty bus station to hitchhike from. It\\'s best to hold a large Hungary sign.\\n\\nIf you wish to continue to [[Budapest]] or other points, try to avoid entering [[Miskolc]] and instead ask your driver to drop you out before the road becomes motorway, and continue from there.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Personal experiences\\'\\'\\'\\n\\n\\'\\'I held a sign saying \"Budapest\" at this spot and got a ride that took me on the old road (non-motorway) to the disused border checkpoint. There was some confusion due to my not speaking Slovak or Hungarian. From there I was able to walk across a bridge to a truck stop on the motorway, which had quite low traffic due to just being parking and toilets, no gas or food. I got extremely lucky and approached a Polish trucker who was willing to take me to Miskolc, but if this had not happened I feel like I could have been there for an extremely long time. I highly advise that you confirm with your driver that they are taking the motorway into Hungary and not the old country road. - [[User:AloysiusDente|AloysiusDente]] (March 2024)\\'\\'\\n\\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\\n\\n[[trash:Košice]] [[nomad:Košice]]\\n\\n\\n\\n[[Category:Slovakia]]\\n[[Category:E58]]',\n",

You can also walk like 500m along the road and try straight from the highway entrance - there is enough space and you can be easily seen. But now (March 2016) it isn\\'t a good place. From the northern entrance to highway there are the fence hindering drivers from seeing you and the road sign forbidding you to walk. From the southern entrance traffic is VERY poor and mostly going to Katowice, not to Rzeszów.\\n\\n\\nTo Ukraine you can\\'t cross the border by foot in Korczowa, but in Medyka. At [[Radymno]] hitchhike {{National Road Number Poland|77}} South to [[Przemyśl]] and from there hitchhike [[Lwowska]] / {{National Road Number Poland|28}} to the border. \\n\\n\\nFor [[Sandomierz]] take tram number 10 or 21 till the last stop \\'\\'Pleszow\\'\\'. From there you can start hitching along national road 79.\\n\\n====Option 2====\\nAnother option is an unused bus stop on Tadeusza Śliwaka street, right before the road junction leading to {{National Road Number Poland|4}} {{E|40}} going east, the GPS coordinates are: 50°02\\'15.0\"N 20°03\\'34.0\"E.

Take the [http://rozklady.mpk.krakow.pl/aktualne/0304/0304rw01.htm bus 304] and get off at \\'\\'Jerzmanowskiego\\'\\' (old \\'\\'Prokocim CPN\\'\\'). There is a bus stop and plenty of space to stop even for a truck. You can also walk like 500m along the road and try straight from the highway entrance - there is enough space and you can be easily seen. But now (March 2016) it isn\\'t a good place. From the northern entrance to highway there are the fence hindering drivers from seeing you and the road sign forbidding you to walk. From the southern entrance traffic is VERY poor and mostly going to Katowice, not to Rzeszów.\\n\\n\\nTo Ukraine you can\\'t cross the border by foot in Korczowa, but in Medyka. At [[Radymno]] hitchhike {{National Road Number Poland|77}} South to [[Przemyśl]] and from there hitchhike [[Lwowska]] / {{National Road Number Poland|28}} to the border. \\n\\n\\nFor [[Sandomierz]] take tram number 10 or 21 till the last stop \\'\\'Pleszow\\'\\'. From there you can start hitching along national road 79.\\n\\n====Option 2====\\nAnother option is an unused bus stop on Tadeusza Śliwaka street, right before the road junction leading to {{National Road Number Poland|4}} {{E|40}} going east, the GPS coordinates are: 50°02\\'15.0\"N 20°03\\'34.0\"E. Use https://krakow.jakdojade.pl/ to check the buses going near that spot, preferably use a connection that will end up at bus stop \\'\\'\\'Przewóz\\'\\'\\' (Bus 158), as it\\'s the nearest one to the spot. This bus stop is right behind the traffic lights, with a lot of space for even a big truck to stop and You will be easily visible. It is not the most popular road leading out of Cracow to the east however, so waiting times may vary. \\n\\n\\nIf You are going to Ukraine, bear in mind that recently finished {{National Road Number Poland|4}} {{E|40}} highway leads to [[Korczowa-Krakovets border crossing]], where You \\'\\'\\'cannot\\'\\'\\' cross the border on foot. it is permitted only at [[Medyka-Shehyni border crossing]]. Also there are very, very few cars stopping at the gas stations and rest areas on highway east of [[Rzeszów]], so before You pass it, either enter a car going straight to Korczowa border crossing (and wait a long time in the car queue), or go straight to Przemyśl, where You can easily access Medyka-Shehyni crossing, avoid rides to towns like Łańcut or Przeworsk, as most likely You will get stuck there.\\n\\n=== South and southwest towards [[Rabka-Zdrój]], [[Ružomberok]] ([[Slovakia|SK]]) {{National Road Number Poland|7}} {{E|77}}, [[Zakopane]] {{National Road Number Poland|47}} and [[Bielsko-Biała]] {{National Road Number Poland|52}} ===\\n\\nTake tram no. 8, 19, 22, 23, 40 (operating only on Sundays and day offs) from the centre to the last stop \\'\\'Borek Fałęcki\\'\\'. There is a small bus station here. You can either walk south for a couple of kilometres until you go under the highway overpass, or take bus 175, 235, 245, 255, 275, 285 and get out at the stop \\'\\'Opatkowice\\'\\' immediately after the highway overpass. You can hitch from the \\'\\'Opatkowice\\'\\' bus stop.\\n\\n\\nAlternatively if you start out early in the morning, you can take the above mentioned bus \\'\\'\\'285\\'\\'\\' much farther away from the city to a much better spot. Get off at Mogilany Ośrodek Zdrowia. This is a bus stop on the highway, hitch from here. Excellent spot! (In case nobody speaks English and you don\\'t know where to get off, if you are in the front of the bus near the driver, you will see a red bridge from the distance, this one: \\'\\'Mogilany Wiadukt\\'\\' {{Coords|49.939466|19.894601|1}} As soon as you see the bridge in the distance, get off immediately. In case you miss it, no worries, you can get off after the bridge and walk back maybe one kilometer) \\n\\'\\'\\'WARNING\\'\\'\\': the bus operates very rarely (and \\'\\'\\'doesn\\'t\\'\\'\\' go on Sundays!), so you should check the timetable here:\\n[http://rozklady.mpk.krakow.pl/aktualne/0285/0285t001.htm 285 bus timetable]\\n\\n\\nIf you are going towards [[Bielsko-Biała]], tell your driver immediately so that he knows to leave you at the fork in the road a few kilometres south of Krakow.\\n\\n\\nIf your are heading to Slovakia, the road splits towards SK in [[Rabka-Zdrój]]. At the fork in the road itself there is a good spot to hitchhike, though there is mainly local traffic and it may require a couple of lifts to reach the Slovak border. Alternatively, if you don\\'t want to hitchhike in Krakow or save some time, you can take a bus to this spot for 9 PLN, which is not that pricier from what would you pay for public transport in Krakow. Bus stop is called \\'\\'Skomielna Biała, skrzyżowanie\\'\\'. You can use [http://www.busy-krk.pl/en/rabka-zdroj-krakow.php this site] to check timetables. You can also take a similar mini-bus to Jabłonka (which is right at the border) for about 20 PLN.\\n\\n== Public Transport ==\\n\\nThere is a very useful and simple to use [http://krakow.jakdojade.pl/?locale=en website] showing you how to get from one point to another by public transport in major Polish cities (in Polish and English).\\n\\n== Sleeping == \\n\\nThe central station (Dworzec Główny) is open during the night, but guards patrol the station constantly and wake up anyone who tries to sleep (even people waiting for trains). Better to find a host from a hospitality exchange service or camp outside the city.\\n\\nYou can sleep in \"student academic\" which is on Czarnowiejska/Reymonta street and there are sleeping students from AGH ( Academy of Science and Technology ).

Out of the station, walk down 200m to the ''Brovarskyi Prospekt'' (Броварський проспект). You'll most likely see locals hitchhiking there already, just walk a bit further up the road to find a convenient spot. The first car should bring you to the next ГАИ (GAI) police post. Do not accept any rides to the city of Бровари (Brovari), as there will be no useful spots to hitchhike along the road. Best is to catch rides only towards Семполки (Sempolki) or Калита (Kalita), there you'll find a GAI post as well. If hitchhiking towards Russia, get off at the eastward junction after 100km. There, it's easy to hitch further rides towards Russia.\\n\\n\\n=== East towards [[Poltava]], [[Kharkiv]], [[Sumy]] ===\\n\\nTake the metro to ''Boryspilska'' (БОРИСПIЛЬСЬКА) station (the second last on the green line). There you find a huge roundabout - walk around the roundabout until you see the turn off to [[Kharkiv]] (XAPKIB). Walk down the road, and you'll probably see a lot of people also hitching there (there were around 40 last time some anonymous hitchhiker did it in the middle of winter); walk to the end of the queue and try to look like you're going a long distance - most people will only be going 30 or 40 km. Try to look different. You can stand a little bit further (close to the motorway sign), put your backpack in front of you and use the thumb gesture or a sign.\\n\\nAlternative: From Kharkivska district, use marshrutka #317a to Borispil. Stay on the marshrutka until the last stop (at the end of the city). From there, you can walk 2km more to the crossroad where road P08 (transit road around Kyiv, especially for trucks) crosses.

Attention: Girls be careful, in the evening there are prostitutes working, so tell to the driver that you are hitchhiking immediately! This spot is really busy with local buses and people who can pick you up for money. You can as well, walk 5 more minutes, until the road is uphill, and hitch from here. Here, all the traffic is heading west as well. \\n\\nHitchiking from here can take some time, as there is also a lot of local traffic, so in case you´re standing here for too long, take a marshrutka direction Zhytomyr, and hop off at the next village called Dmytrivka. Then you're already along the motorway where most traffic goes long-distance. In addition to that, the bus stop is quite spacious, so trucks can more easily stop here than at the Zhytomyrska spot. \\n\\nIf you are going southwest, then you turn at the town of [[Zhytomyr]] 100\\xa0km west from Kyiv.\\n\\n\\n=== South towards [[Odessa|Odesa]] (M05) ===\\n\\nGet the metro ''Teremky'' (ТЕРЕМКИ) station (last one on blue line). Walk 700 m southwest and you'll find a police post, you can just hitchhike behind this post as there is a large area for cars to stop. There is traffic light before it so make sure drivers can see you while waiting for green light. But take care, drivers tend to use the parking lane to overtake slow traffic along the road!

Be prepared with enough supplies, because the town is small, and the prices are inflated by tourism.\\n\\n== Hitching out ==\\nGetting around in the Rockies is quite easy. The Trans-Can has lots of traffic, but wait times are going to be hit or miss, because there is a lot of tourism in the area. From town, its about an 1km walk to the Highway 93 overpass.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Saskatchewan River Crossing]], [[Jasper]] on Hwy-93 ===\\nHead North out of town. Along the the Trans-Can there are concrete dividers running along the Highway so hitch hiking a long the way will be difficult, and dangerous. Half way to the Hwy-93 exit, there is an \"Wildlife Overpass\" so \\'\\'\\'be careful\\'\\'. There is lots of traffic, and no pedestrian crossing. Once you are at the Hwy-93 interchange there will not be THAT much traffic, but chances are you get picked up.\\n\\nIf you are wanting to go to Jasper then you may want to hold out for a ride that goes all the way to Jasper. the only settlement between Lake Louise, and Jasper is \"Saskatchewan River Crossing\", and all that is really there is a gas station, a hotel (that charges 180$ a night), and the beginning of Hwy-11 to [[Rocky Mountain House]], and [[Red Deer]].\\n\\n=== West toward [[Golden]], [[Kamloops]], on ([[Trans-Canada Highway|Hwy-1]]) ===\\nThe Trans-Can continues West from the Hwy-93 exit, but it would be smarter to simply hitch from Lake Louise. heading in that direction you will pass a small settlement named Trail. It is beautiful, but there aren\\'t many services, and you are better off passing through.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Banff]], [[Calgary]] on ([[Trans-Canada Highway|Hwy-1]]) ===\\nBest to start early as many people commute to Calgary.\\n\\n(2024) took 20 minutes to get a ride to downtown Banff. waited on the main road outside the Lake Louise Gondola (park and ride area). Lots of traffic and space to pull over.\\n\\n== Accommodation and Sleep ==\\nthere is a lot of natural woodland in the area, but there is also a lot of wildlife.

It is the main city of the French speaking canton Vaud.\\n[[File:Lausanneswitzerland.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Anthony hitchhiking in Lausanne]]\\n\\n== Hitching out ==\\nThere are in Lausanne 4 motorway entries coming from north/east, north, west, south/west.\\n<!-- TOO PERSONAL: I list here my favorite spots to go out of the city by the motorway, there are others that I don\\'t like, and also depending on the direction, you can use smaller streets. --> \\n\\n\\n=== North towards [[Bern]], [[Neuchâtel]] ===\\n\\nYou can hitch at the motorway entrance at the north of the city. Take bus 1 in the direction \\'\\'Blécherette\\'\\' and get off at the last stop. The journey takes around 20 minutes.\\n \\nThere are 3 possibilities there. Someone strongly advices against possibilities 2 and 3:\\n\\n# From the bus stop follow \\'\\'Route du châtelard\\'\\' in direction of the motorway. After approx. 50 m there is a zebra crossing. You can stand just after it, the cars will slow down because of the crossing and there is space for the cars to pull into. As of August 2014, the pull-out spot is occupied by a large blue construction block but cars will still have space to pull out if you stand in front of it. Don\\'t stand too close to the cross walk, though, since some cars will think you are waiting to cross and will stop for you. It\\'s a good idea to use a sign since there are several possible directions drivers can be heading. Someone advices [[Yverdon]], [[Bern]] or both. If your driver goes only to Yverdon, ask to be dropped at the big (and only!) petrol station called \\'\\'Bavois\\'\\' around 30 km before the city. From there it is really to get a direct lift to [[Bern]] or even [[Zürich|Zurich]].\\n# Another possibility is to go further on \\'\\'Route du châtelard\\'\\' (100 m) and stand shortly before both motorway entrances (in both directions). The disadvantages would be: 1) if you are going direction north, it is  difficult for cars to stop since they would be on the left track of the road especially on rush hour and more of that it is a fast traffic road so cars don\\'t have time and space to pull down. 2) you would have to stand BEFORE both entry which go to two different directions. It may be confusing for drivers if you don\\'t have a sign. If you have one, this place is too stressful for drivers so that they have time to read it...\\n# Walk 20 m from point 2, so that you cross the bridge over the motorway and thus take only cars in the right direction. You would stand at the entrance of the motorway. This is barely legal and some consider the spot dangerous...\\n\\n=== North/East towards [[Vevey]] ===\\nsee spot 1) of [[#North towards Bern, Neuchâtel]] section. It is the same motorway entry but to the other direction. stand with a sign Chexbres which is the next village before which there is a petrol station, or [[Vevey]]. If you go further Vevey the petrol station to be dropped at is the one mentioned before. It is not good to be dropped at Vevey itself if you want to stay on the motorway since the city is at the edge of the see ca. 800m downhill.\\n\\n=== West towards [[Geneva]], [[Nyon]] ===\\n# You can try the motorway entry [[#North towards Bern, Neuchâtel|north of the city]] and stand with a sign \\'\\'Geneva\\'\\'.\\n# Stand at the south/west motorway entry. To go there take the tram (M1) from the \\'\\'Flon\\'\\' station. Stop at the \\'\\'Bourdonette\\'\\' stop. You\\'ll see directly a space where buses are waiting. Cars driving to Geneva pass beside the bus area, you can stand there with a sign because people could basically drive to all directions from there.\\n# You can stand at the entry 1-2 km before spot no 2. It is where the motorway begins, there is a traffic-circle, cars drive quite fast and don\\'t have much possibility to pull out. It is also not really safe to stand there. To go there take bus nr 1 or 2 direction \\'\\'Maladière\\'\\' and stop at this station. You\\'ll directly see the traffic-circle. Attention: At this spot you\\'ll find a huge \\'\\'Hitchhiking here is forbidden\\'\\' sign, even in four languages(!) and somebody put some cones there, so the spot is quite useless. Though from here the M1 tram described above is going as well to \\'\\'Bourdonette\\'\\'.\\n# There is a petrol station/truck stop at coordinates (46.506299,6.709443).  It\\'s great for going north, west or east.  It\\'s possible to ask people who are pumping gas for rides - and for some advice, learn about license plates - for example, plates from Geneva begin with a \"GE\" and Zurich is \"ZH.\"\\n\\n== Resources ==\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n{{IsIn|Switzerland}}\\n{{Template:Cities Switzerland}}\\n[[Category:Switzerland]]\\n[[Category:E23]]\\n[[Category:E25]]\\n\\n[[tr:Lozan]]\\n[[fr:Lausanne]]',\n",

There is a place you can stand on the slip road to the M1 that is a 10-15 min walk from the city centre. People do get lifts from there, but it can feel a bit sketchy cos cars go past pretty fast. You can also take bus 2 or 3 to Maumoniat\\'s Supermarket on Dewsbury Road, and from there walk to junction 5 of the M621. It\\'s less dangerous, but still quite slow as there is not much space for cars to pull over. \\n\\nAnother option, if you have a couple of £s, is to get a bus to the nearest services. Get bus 444 from stop P5 which is on City square, opposite the train station. You can also get the 110 bus to Wakefield, leaving from Leeds bus station roughly every 10 minutes. These buses will take you to Wakefield Bus station. Alternatively, you can catch the train from Leeds train station to Wakefield Westgate station and then walk 10 minutes to the bus station. Usually tickets are not asked for on train to Wakefield Westgate and to get through barriers at Leeds just buy a \\'metro concessionary fare single Leeds - Burley Park Road\\' for £1.00.  At bus station you will need to catch the 96 bus (£3.00 - July 2014). After quite a long, windy bus route you need to get off on Bretton lane, just before the Yorkshire sculpture park (get the driver to give you a shout). Walk up Bramley lane and you will see the services. Cross over the bridge to get to the southbound section. If you get lost ask people for ‘Wooley edge services’ – they might think you’re a bit nuts but will generally help. Once you find it it’s fairly easy to get lifts. You can also stay on this bus until just after Yorkshire Sculpture Park, and get off at the stop on the roundabout. You can hitch straight from here, as there is a slip road to the M1. It\\'s a bit quieter, but saves you the walk to the services.\\n\\n[http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=bramley+lane+wakefield&sll=53.098145,-2.443696&sspn=7.378599,20.170898&ie=UTF8&ll=53.623492,-1.55581&spn=0.014228,0.039396&z=15&om=1 Google map to Wooley Edge]\\n\\n\\n=== To [[Manchester]] & [[Liverpool]] ===\\n\\nThe slip road to the M621 is right next to the M1 south slip road. Unfortunately this is an even hairier place to stand because you\\'re pretty much on the road. It is possible to get lifts if you\\'re feeling daring. Junction 2 of the M621 (beside Elland Road Football Stadium) is a lot safer (there is medium sized shoulder to hitch from), and has a reasonable amount of traffic. Alternatively, you could get a bus to Hartshead Moor services, but might not really be worth it if you\\'re just going to Manchester because the bus all the way there wouldn’t cost much more.\\n\\n\\n=== Northwest, towards Ilkley, Dales, Lake District ===\\n\\nWalk north up Otley Rd. (this road starts in town and goes past the universities–it\\'s called Woodhouse Lane, then Headingley Lane, then Otley Rd.). It’s a bit of a walk but you can start trying to hitch anywhere after the big roundabout near Lawnswood and Boddington hall. People driving in this direction are likely to be in a good mood, so chances of getting a lift are high.\\n\\n\\n=== North, towards [[Newcastle]], [[Scotland]] and [[York]] ===\\n\\nYou can walk out of town to Oakwood (about 3 miles). Get on Roundhay Road (ask for Thomas Danby College - everyone will know it, and it\\'s on Roundhay Road) and keep going until you reach a small clock tower, Oakwood Clock, about 5 minutes past a large Tesco that will be on your left. Keep going straight onto Wetherby Road (A58). Alternatively the 12, 13, 13A, 99, 98 and X98 buses from the city centre all stop at Oakwood Clock. The 99, 98 and X98 will all take you to a roundabout on the ring road, which is ideal for hitching. Alternatively, all three also go on to Wetherby bus station, which can be more reliable. If on foot, keep on Wetherby Road until you reach a roundabout on the ring road (there are signs). However, this can mean quite a walk and getting the 50, 50A or 49 buses from Leeds to the bottom of Easterly Road (the stop to get off at is Monkswood, Easterly Road Boggart Hill Drive (Stop 45013940)) will save about 25 minutes of walking as opposed to going to Oakwood Clock. From here it is only a few minutes from the aforementioned roundabout.\\n\\nTo get to York, make your way to where York Road cuts across the ring road. This is about a mile and a half South along the ring road from the above mentioned roundabout. Getting to this point can be done by walking from Leeds down York Road through the suburbs of Leeds, or by getting the 4ftr bus. If on foot, remember that when York Road from the city centre hits the ring road you have to go north up the ring road for 10 minutes before York Road continues. There\\'s a green car wash just past the roundabout (where the York road and the ring road meet) which is ideal to hitch from just in front of. Virtually everybody will be going straight to York and the high level of commuters makes getting picked up a breeze.\\n\\n\\n== Hitching into Leeds ==\\n\\nIf you are coming from the south on the M1, you might get a lift from someone who is continuing west towards Manchester, or north towards Newcastle. You can ask to be dropped at Junction 28 of the M62 or Junction 46 of the M1. From both places there are regular buses that go into the centre (or you can continue to hitch), and it is easy for your driver to pull back onto the motorway.\\n\\nIf you are coming up the A1 and want to get to Leeds, the junction with the A64 is possibly a good place to be dropped. It\\'s not the shortest route, but it is quite busy. It can be difficult after dark though, because there are no streetlights.\\n\\n\\n== Other useful information ==\\n\\n=== Squatting ===\\n\\nIf you need somewhere to stay or want to get in touch with squatters in Leeds try emailing the [http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/group/squat-network-north/ Squat network north yahoo group].\\n\\n=== Showers ===\\n\\nThere are various showers you can use on Leeds University campus.

From the center it\\'s about an 45 minutes to an hour\\'s walk. From Train and bus station \"Leiden Lammerschans\" it should only be a about twenty minutes as follows:\\n\\n==== The N11/A4 junction (Bottom right on map) ====\\n\\n[[File:A4L11.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Junction, as you come out of the park]]\\nHead \\'\\'\\'South East\\'\\'\\' on \\'\\'\\'Melchior Treublaan\\'\\'\\'.\\nCross the \\'\\'\\'Kanaalweg\\'\\'\\' and onto the \\'\\'\\'Kanaalbrug\\'\\'\\' across the channel.\\nTurn right onto \\'\\'\\'Cronesteinpad\\'\\'\\', and \\n-right afher you cross the \\'\\'\\'rail crossing\\'\\'\\',\\ntake the first left into the park.\\nIt will soon split up into a bike path and a footpath, follow the bike path. (It\\'s called \"\\'\\'\\'Boerenpad\\'\\'\\'\", though I\\'m not sure it\\'s denoted onywhere)\\nThe path will lead to the other end of the park where a small connection on your left leads you up to where the A4 and N11 meet.\\n\\nTo hitch EAST to Utrecht hitch the hard shoulder of the road straight ahead (the \\'\\'\\'N11\\'\\'\\') \\nTo hitch SOUTH to Rotterdam go right which leads to the \\'\\'\\'A4\\'\\'\\'.\\n\\nRemember as always in [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]], do not go past the signs that have the motorway or highway symbol on them, as you may get fined.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Schiphol]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Utrecht]] ===\\nNote the reason Utrecht is listed under both East and North is that while the N11 (a local road) is the most direct way another common way of travelling to Utrecht is to pass over the South ring of Amsterdam, and so you can catch rides quite well this way too.\\n\\n==== Plesmanlaan Shell station (left on map) ====\\n[[File:ShellA4.jpg|thumb|400px|right|The Shell station on Plesmanlaan leading to the A44]]\\nFrom the main exit (\\'\\'\\'South East\\'\\'\\') of The Central trainstation head right (South West) on Schipholweg. Turn right onto Plesmanlaan after about 250 meters. This is the big tunnel, not the small one. Follow plesmanlaan for 1.5 km or so when a Shell station will appear on your right. Note that there is not a sidewalk the whole way, but you are allowed to walk until the petrol station, no problem.\\n\\nFrom here, you\\'re best off asking people if they pass by the what is commonly as the \"bridge restaurant\" on the A4, unless they go straight to your destination of course. This Service station with a bridge and a few restaurants is a great place from which to hitch on to the airport or Amsterdam.\\n\\nDo not bother with the BP station on the left early on Plesmanlaan, as they are likely to send you away, depending on who is working that day.\\n\\n===Alternative (All directions) ===\\n\\nThis place should be relatively easy to get to, it\\'s just under 10 minutes walking from train and bus station \"Leiden Lammerschans\" \\n\\nFrom the trainstation continue walking down the Lammerschansweg until you meet a bike tunnel, pass through the tunnel and the second after the small bike rotunda and go left to cross the \"Lammebrug\". \\n\\nJust after the Lammebrug there is a small slip road that leads to the \"Cronesteyn\" restaurant, standing on the side of it you should be easy to see and easy to pick up!\\n\\nThis road leads to the A4, you will also be able to get rides to Utrecht from people that leave the city from here, they drive over a small piece of the A4 to get to the N11\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n{{Cities Netherlands}}\\n{{Cities Zuid-Holland}}\\n\\n[[Category:Zuid Holland]]\\n[[Category:City\\'s]]\\n{{IsIn|Zuid Holland}}',\n",

Check out Plagwitz, Südvorstadt, the \"Eisenbahnstraße\" (most dangerous street in Germany according to some newspapers) and Connewitz if you\\'re there.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n=== North towards [[Berlin]], South towards [[Munich|München]] {{Ade|9}} ===\\n==== Option 1 ====\\nTake the bus #131 from the city center to \\'\\'Dölzig\\'\\' and get out at \\'\\'Südstraße\\'\\', one stop before the \\'\\'Nova Eventis\\'\\' center. You can hitchhike directly from the bus stop. Try to find your ride here towards [[Berlin]] or [[Munich]]!\\nBeware, that bus doesn\\'t run very often.\\n\\n==== Option 2 ====\\nIt\\'s also possible to get to the spot described above with tram #7 in direction \\'\\'Böhlitz-Ehrenberg\\'\\'. Get out at the tram stop \\'\\'Georg-Schwartz-Strasse/Merseburger Strasse\\'\\'. From there, walk back some 10m towards the main road and walk right towards the \\'\\'Aral\\'\\' petrol station, across the road from which you can catch a ride to the A9. If you don\\'t like the spot, follow the road for 200m until you passed a \\'\\'Lidl\\'\\' supermarket, and after that some meters further you\\'ll find a bus stop (\\'\\'Lindenau Friedhof\\'\\'). From there you can easily hitchhike a ride towards \\'\\'Dölzig\\'\\' and/or the motorway. Make sure to get out at the last traffic lights before the motorway. There\\'s a bus stop where you can hitchhike easily. A sign might be useful. Hitchhiking ~800m further directly at the [[on-ramp]] is pretty dangerous, there\\'s no place for cars to stop and traffic passes by pretty fast.\\n\\n==== Option 3 ====\\nYou can take a train from the Main Station, Leipzig-Gohlis, Leipzig-Coppiplatz, Leipzig-Möckern or Leipzig-Leutzsch (Regional Express \"RB\") that goes to \"Weißenfels\". Get off at \"Rückmarsdorf\". From there you walk north straight up to the big street that leads to the {{Ade|9}}. It\\'s about 300 m and the way is intuitive. You can either start from there or follow the street westwards for about 500 m where you find a car seller for Renault. There is plenty of space to stop and pick you up. If people only go to Dölzig take the lift. The spot at the Busstaion Südstraße (first option) is slightly better.\\nThe great advantage of this option is that you get to Rückmarsdorf very fast. Especially if you live close to one of the trainstops mentioned above you\\'re ready to start hitkchhiking in some 10 minutes (vs. 27 minutes busride from the Main Station in Bus #131). Remember that the train only goes once an hour (March 2015: From the Main Station at xx:47 h from track 6).\\n\\n=== North towards [[Berlin]] and [[Magdeburg]]/[[Hamburg]] {{Ade|14}} ===\\nThere is a brilliant spot to ask people for lifts at an \"Aral\"-petrol station which is the last one before the Autobahn {{Ade|14}} that also leads onto the {{Ade|9}} to Berlin. \\n\\nTake tram 16 with or without a 2,40 Euro-Ticket in the direction of Messegelände and get off at \"Hornbach Baumarkt\" from here it\\'s a 15min walk to the station but it\\'s worth it. Walk in the same direction as the tram and take an immediate right onto \"Dübener Landstraße\" along the parking lot of the big hardware store. After passing the bridge over the B2 it becomes Nathusiusstraße. Keep walking straight until you reach Ztschortauer Straße where you turn left and walk another 300 metres until you see the \"Aral\"-petrol station on your left. \\n\\nAsking people for a lift towards Berlin on the {{Ade|9}} or towards Magdeburg on the {{Ade|14}} (which is also the way to go for Hamburg) usually works just fine here.\\nThe first rest stop going north from here will be \\'\\'\\'[[:de:Köckern Ost|Köckern Ost]]\\'\\'\\' on the {{Ade|9}}, that isn\\'t too far. On the {{Ade|14}}, it is \\'\\'\\'[[:de:Plötzetal Ost|Plötzetal Ost]]\\'\\'\\' which is past Halle. Most of the A14 traffic goes to Halle so you might want to get the ride anyway and get off at the non-gas-station rest area that is on the A14, before Halle but after the branch-off to Berlin.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Dresden]] {{Ade|14}} {{Ade|38}} ===\\n[[File:Hitching spot leipzig.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Spot in Leipzig described in Option 2 for hitchhiking North or South]]\\n\\n==== Option 1 ====\\nTake a tram to \"Permoser Str./ Torgauer Str.\" (3/3E direction \"Taucha\"; or Bus 90 direction \"Paunsdorfcenter\"; check here: www.lvb.de/timetable). You walk some 50 meters along \"Permoser Straße\" (the one without tram tracks) and start hitchhiking from there. Drivers already see you from the traffic light and can stop easily on the \"white lines\". While heading east you\\'ll also find gas stations to ask people directly.\\n\\n==== Option 2 ====\\nTake a tram to the stop \"Paunsdorfer Alle/Permoser Strasse\". Show a sign saying \"Dresden\" and find a good spot on the street towards east which is close to the motorway junction already. There are mixed reports about this spot.\\n\\n==== Option 3 ====\\nTake the Tram #15 or #2 from the city center towards \\'\\'Meusdorf\\'\\' and get out at the last station, which is called Meusdorf. Go 250 Meters further to the next bus stop. This is the best spot to [[Dresden]] via {{Ade|38}} and {{Ade|14}}/{{Ade|4}}.\\n\\n==== Option 4 ====\\nOnramp to the highway A14, at the crossing of B6 and A14. There is no sidestrip, but it is barely possible for cars to stop. \\n[[File:Tzuiop9c onramp Leipzig A14xB6.jpg|thumb|Onramp to A14 at the crossing with B6, east-end of Permoserstraße]]\\n\\n==== Option 5: service area Muldental ====\\nIn direction Dresden you then have a service area called \"Muldental\" since a lot of people turn of before Dresden so that you can use also the rather local traffic (to Grimma or further).\\n\\n=== West towards [[Erfurt]], [[Cologne|Köln]], [[Belgium]] {{Ade|4}} ===\\n[[File:CraigChristmasHitch.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Santa Claus [[User:Halt, Stop! Reudnitz kommt.|Craig]] hitching bus stop near \\'\\'Leipzig West\\'\\' ({{Ade|9}}).]]\\nWhen heading to Belgium highway number 4 is a decent option. \\nYou can take bus 131 from Main Station (Leipzig Hauptbahnhof) or Merseburgerstrasse that will take you all the way close to the {{Ade|9}} (alight at B181/Dölzig). At the bus stop you can easily get a lift in all directions. All day long heavy traffic yay ;-) [[User:Halt, Stop! Reudnitz kommt.|Craig]]\\'s waiting times average at 15 mins for direction [[Cologne]] (West) or [[Nuremberg]] (South), 20 mins direction [[Berlin]] (North).\\n\\nFirst you have to go south on the {{Ade|9}}, use a sign \"A9 Süd\", there\\'s a gas station on the highway 30 km south from Leipzig called \"Osterfeld\". There you can find a ride going West on the {{Ade|4}} . Ask for people going at least to Erfurt. The only service area with gas station on the {{Ade|4}} before Erfurt is called \"Eichelborn\" and is located BEYOND Jena.\\nThe on-ramp on the side away from Leipzig is slightly more spacious (but not spacious) and there was a little more traffic when [[User:Guaka|guaka]] was hitching from there on Thursday around noon.  \\n\\nRight after getting onto the {{Ade|4}} there\\'s a restaurant (but no gas station) called \"Teufelstal\" that\\'s okay during the day ([[User:Guaka|guaka]] found a long ride to almost Giessen from there).\\n\\n=== West towards [[Göttingen]], [[Kassel]], [[Belgium]] {{Ade|38}} ===\\nThere seems to be no good hitchhiking spot for {{Ade|38}} in Leipzig itself. But you can jump a regional train towards Eisenach and get out in Grosskorbetha. It is about 30 minutes train ride and it is likely they might control tickets but if you keep your eyes open you should manage to dance around them( check https://hitchwiki.org/en/Train). In Grosskorbetha you need to walk 3,5 km to a parking lot that is directly on {{Ade|38}}. There is no gas station just a toilet but you should be able to get a lift at least to the first gas station from here. There are two gas stations on A38. First is [[:de:Rohnetal Nord|Rohnetal Nord]] which is shortly before Sangerhausen and second one is called Eichsfeld and is situated before Leinefelde.\\n\\n== Hitching In ==\\nWhen coming through the  {{Ade|14}} it is fairly easy to get off at Leipzig Nord-Ost or Leipzig-Ost, where you have possibilities for the driver to turn around and the tram is within 1 km reach. If coming from south-east, lot of drivers go in via {{Ade|38}}. In both cases you can use the directions given in the two optionjs for getting onto {{Ade|14}} direction Dresden.\\nOtherwise, options are the airport where a train is going regularly into the city. \\n\\nIf traveling the {{Ade|9}}, you can best get off at Leipzig-West. The driver can go off to \"Einkaufszentrum\", then let you out at Nova Eventis. There you can easily get a car to the center just hitchhike anywhere near the exit for Leipzig at the parking with a sign \"LE\". \\n\\nHitchhiker [[User:Halt, Stop! Reudnitz kommt.|Craig]] would rather recommend to ask drivers going off to \\'\\'Leipzig\\'\\'. The road directions are not separated on that side anymore and there is a perfect spot (bus stop) for hitching into the city plus drivers can easily make u-turn going back to the highway. [[Korn|Korn]] mentions, that you can catch a ride from here even in the night pretty easy. If you get off earlier and don´t want to walk that far, there is also a huge keeping area on the right side, after you left the highway and underpass the bridge. It is also the first possible point for cars to make a u-turn and get back on the highway.\\n\\n== Public transport - Riding with and without a ticket ==\\n\\'\\'the information below does not apply to the S-Bahn city train. See [[Deutsche Bahn]] instead\\'\\'\\n\\nUsing public transportation without a ticket is fairly easy in Leipzig.\\n\\nGetting caught without a ticket:\\n* fine is 60 EUR, payable by bank transfer in about 10 days\\n* I don\\'t know if there are special rules if you possess a non-German ID\\n\\nAnyway...\\n* Ticket machines outside trams give you unstamped tickets\\n* You can validate tickets in both trams and buses, the machines \\'\\'beep\\'\\' when you do so (\\'\\'check if there is a ticket stamping machine in the rear of the bus\\'\\')\\n* Inside most trams, there\\'s a ticket machine that gives you a stamped ticket (\\'\\'just hanging around there won\\'t serve as excuse if you get busted\\'\\')\\n* Bus drivers also sell stamped tickets\\n\\n* You could buy a (short range, if you\\'re on low money) ticket and keep it unstamped\\n\\n* Most transportation rules for German public transport are along the lines that you have to present a valid ticket if you\\'re asked to do so\\n* \\'\\'\\'You need to get the ticket stamped \\'\\'before\\'\\' the traffic control reaches you\\'\\'\\'\\n* If you\\'ve got an unstamped ticket, you can argue that you didn\\'t know about validating it - the tourist act usually works\\n\\n* After 20:00, you usually need to get in buses at the front and show your ticket to the bus driver\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n{{hitchbase_city|50}}\\n[[Category:City\\'s]]\\n[[Category:Saxony]]\\n[[Category:E51]]\\n\\n[[de:Leipzig]]\\n[[fr:Leipzig]]',\n",

It is mainly a calm administrative and university city with the ''Katholieke Universiteit Leuven'' which includes some magnificent historic buildings and cityscape.\\n__NOTOC__\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== West towards [[Brussels]] ===\\nJust walk on the ring of '''Leuven''' to the ''Tervuursevest'' and hitch along the ''Koning Boudewijnlaan''. You will see many cars parked along the road, so you can start to hitch from there.\\n\\nAnother option is to walk or take the bus (351, 352, 358) to the Brusselsesteenweg (the N2) and hitchhike from there (just hitchhike on the bus stop). The N2 goes straight to Brussels.\\n\\nThe best option is however to walk a bit further down the N2 to hitchhike on the entrance to the E314 direction Brussels / Luik. There is place for the cars to stop and there are many cars going to Brussels from there. The waiting time is usually not longer than 20 minutes.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Liège|Liege]], [[Genk]], [[Germany]], [[Netherlands]] / West towards [[Brussels]], [[Gent]] ===\\nThe E40 is passing at quite a distance on the southern side of the city, but there is a service station which can be a good spot to hitch a quick ride east towards [[Liège|Liege]] and [[Germany]] or west towards [[Brussels]] or [[Gent]]. The service station direction west is also the last one before the ring of Brussels.\\n\\nTo reach the service station from '''Leuven''': Take bus #395 direction ''Overijse-Groenendal'' and go out at stop ''Rotspoelstraat''. Alternatively try the buses #7-8-9 in direction ''Bertem'' and get out at ''Egenhoven'' and then walk down the ''St-Jansbergsesteenweg''.\\n\\nA very good spot to get to the service station is to start from the entrance of the E314 direction Brussel / Luik on the N2 (Brusselsesteenweg). You can get there by walking (about 20 minutes from the city center) or take the bus 351, 352, 358 and get off at the stop 'Herent Diependaal'.\\n\\nAnother option, if you are already in the Eastern Part of the city (such as Bierbeek or Kessel-lo), is to walk to the junction of the N25 (Tiensesteenweg - Meerdalboslaan) which leads to the E40 at Exit 23. You can either try to hitch a ride at the junction or simply walk the 2-3km along the Expressweg to the E40 itself and hitch on the On-Ramp (which is having a large shoulder).\\n\\nIf you're heading east into the city, you can get off at one of the main highway service stations and just ask people there if they are continuing on to your destination.  i.e. Genk is the next major city heading East.\\n\\nAnother way to get to the East is via the E314 leading to Aarschot, Genk and then to the Netherlands. A good way to enter the highway is to hitchhike on the ramp on the N2 (Brusselsesteenweg). You can get there by walking (about 20 minutes from the city center) or take the bus 351, 352, 358 and get off at the stop 'Herent Diependaal'. You can also ask people to drop you off at the petrol station in Rotselaar and continue your journey from there.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Mechelen]] ===\\nTo hitch from Leuven in direction North, you simply have to walk out of the city to the Mechelsesteenweg. The best would be to walk a bit further out of town, passing the viaduct of the Ring of Leuven ''(Singel)'' and then a bit further passed the E314 junction. From there you can hitch both the traffic coming from Leuven and from the motorway. There is a petrol station nearby, where you could possibly ask or at least where cars can pull over.\\nOnce you reached that spot it is pretty useless to walk further to Herent as the road forms a by-pass around the hamlet, but do not refuse rides going to the neighborhood of ''Haacht'' as it is easy to hitch further from there as well from the huge roundabouts.\\n\\nYou can also possibly try to reach the E19 by changing at the junction with the N21 ''(Haacht)'', which can lead you also to the neighbourhood of the Airport or the N267 ''(Schiplaken)''\\n\\n=== South towards [[Luxembourg]] ===\\nYou may follow the instructions for going to the direction of Brussels and then continue from there. \\nAlternatively, you could walk from the Leuven ring road to Naamsesteenweg. For example near the Heverlee station there is place for getting a ride. It is pretty easy to get to Louvain-La-Neuve this way and from there you can take the motorway south. \\n\\n== Hitching In ==\\n==='''From Genk/Hasselt'''===\\nIf you happen to pass around '''Leuven''' by the E314, you can simply ask to be dropped at any of the town or its suburb's exit (Exit 16 - 17 or 18) and walk into downtown. \\n\\n==='''From Brussels/Liège'''===\\nAlthough if you are approaching Leuven through the E40, you might have to be dropped at the Leuven Services (Shell) or Heverlee (Texaco) and walk toward the local road into town, which is still quite a distance. Alternatively, you might get dropped at the exit 23 (Haasrode) and try to hitch along the local road into town, or walk the 4 remaining km.\\n\\n==='''From Antwerp/Mechelen'''===\\nComing from direction Antwerp, your last stop before Leuven might very well be rest stop 'Waarloos' on the E19. From here, you have two option for getting to Leuven. Number one is a ride via Brussels to Leuven or Liège along the E19, Brussels Ringroad and E40. You will end up at the Heverlee service station. However, at Waarloos there seem to be very drivers that go toward Liège. Alternatively, you could accept a ride to Mechelen. Quite many people are headed for Mechelen, a city just off the highway after Waarloos. The local road N26 leads directly from Mechelen to Leuven. Negotiate with the driver before you agree to be taken to Mechelen: they should drop you off on the far side of the city, where the Leuvensesteenweg originates at the Mechelen city ring. You'll need a sign on this road as a big portion of traffic is likely to be local.\\n\\n{{IsIn|Vlaams-Brabant}}\\n[[trash:Leuven]]\\n\\n[[Category:Vlaams-Brabant]]\\n[[Category:E40]]\",\n",

It is the fourth largest urban area in France.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n=== Going south? Take the A1 towards [[Paris]], or directly to south of France join the A26 towards [[Reims]], [[Dijon]], [[Lyon]] (so also direction Spain & Italy) ===\\n\\nGoing to Paris?\\nHave a \\'\\'\\'\"PARIS\"-sign\\'\\'\\'.\\nThe \"autoroute\" A1 leads to Paris.\\n\\nHeading further than Paris? To the south of France (and Italy, Spain)?\\nHave a \\'\\'\\'\"LYON\"-sign\\'\\'\\'. Why? To avoid Paris. \\nIt is difficult to cross Paris.\\nEspecially to leave Paris.\\nSo therefore consider a \\'\\'\\'\"LYON\"-sign\\'\\'\\' when you are still north of Paris.\\nTry to get on the \"autoroute\" A26. \\nLike try to someone take you to the \"Peage\" (= toll) right before the junction between A1/A26: stand at this \"Peage\"-square with a \"A26/LYON\"-sign).\\n\\nFrom Lille you can choose to go the first petrol station on the A1, direction Paris.\\nLeaving Lille with a \\'\\'\\'\"AIRE PHALEMPIN\"-sign\\'\\'\\'.\\nIf you can reach this petrol station \"Aire de Phalempin\" it is a good way to go south. (On Google Maps it seems you could walk to this petrol station, from the village of Seclin, south of Lille. Seclin has a train station. In french is described how you can get their by feet on: [http://hitchwiki.org/fr/index.php?title=Lille&action=edit&section=3])) \\n\\nSee below several alternatives to get on the A1 : \\n\\n\\n;Most optimal place to hitchhike seems to be :\\nGo to \\'\\'metrostation « Porte d\\'Arras »\\'\\'. From there walk in the direction of the motorway, cross the bridge. On the left you will see an accelerating lane going onto the motorway (=Motorway A25, which joins the A1 to Paris after about 1 km). You can stand next to the traffic lights just before the ramp with a sign. Or stand on the ramp itself, people have time to stop on the ramp. \\n(NOTE after about 1 km this motorway joins the A1 to Paris, but the motorway does ALSO turns direction of Gent, so if your heading North, this \\'\\'metrostation « Porte d\\'Arras »\\'\\'-alternatieve is also a good place.)\\n\\nTestimonies:\\n\\n* [[User:Garthelgard|Garthelgard]] has hitchhiked from this spot more than twenty times and has never waited more than 30 minutes.\\n\\n* In August 2012 somebody added: \"The best place to go anywhere is the hard shoulder near \\'\\'metrostation « Porte d\\'Arras »\\'\\' follow Highway-signs. Within 20 minutes more cars heading towards several directions stopped.\"\\n\\n* Lastrik tried this alternative, they tried for two and a half hours before going somewhere else \\n\\n\\n;Alternative 1\\nGo to \\'\\'metro station « Valenciennes »\\'\\'. Walking to the north, after about 100 meters you can go eastwards  and follow the \"\\'\\'Avenue Denis Cordonnier\\'\\'\". The A1 crosses this \"\\'\\'Avenue Denis Cordonnier\\'\\'\". And there is an entrance to the A1. \\n(The Hostel/Auberge de jeunesse \"Stephane Hessel\" is on crossing of \"\\'\\'Avenue Denis Cordonnier\\'\\'\" and \"\\'\\'Boulevard Paul Painlevé\\'\\'\". Address: \\'\\'235, Boulevard Paul Painlevé\\'\\')\\n\\n\\n;Alternative 2 \\nAt the end of \\'\\'Boulevard des Cités Unies\\'\\' (at the side of the railways). 300 meters eastwards from \\'\\'metrostation « Lille Grand Palais »\\'\\', you find an entrance to the A1 direction Paris.\\n\\n\\n;Alternative 3\\nGo to \\'\\'metro station « Porte de Douai »\\'\\'. Walk or hitch 4 km south (direction Ronchin). Or take the bus \"Liane 1\". After 4 km you will see a Novotel on your lefthand. There is a roundabout where there is a sign direction A1 Paris. However there is no direct access to the A1, the traffic direction Paris soon joins the A1 (After several hundreds meter, so if you walk to the south, you will come to the next roundabout, here there is a direct access to A1. And cars can stop for you.)\\n\\n\\n;Alternative 4\\n\\'\\'« Aire de Phalempin »\\'\\' in the south of Lille remain the best spot to get to this direction. There are several ways to commute to this gas station. First, you can take a regional train from \\'\\'Gare de Lille-Flandres\\'\\' to \\'\\'Seclin\\'\\' (15-minute long ride). There are higher chances to get controlled on the train.\\nAn other way to get there is to take the bus L92 to Seclin Gare or the bus 55 to \\'\\'Seclin Le Riez\\'\\'. From there on, walk for about 15 minutes to \\'\\'\"Aire de Phalempin\"\\'\\'\\nA ticket for the Ilevia network cost 1.70 EUR, as of January 2022. It is hard to fraud in buses, and the chances to get controlled on regional trains are high. Try at least to find a ticket on the floor in any station, as it is better to have an \\'invalid ticket\\' in case of a control.\\n\\n=== Going Northeast? Take the A22/E17 towards [[Antwerpen|Antwerp]], [[Gent]], [[Netherlands]] ===\\n\\nThe \\'\\'metrostation « Porte d\\'Arras »\\'\\'-alternative described above at \"Going south?\" seems to be good: see for description and testimonials above at \"Going south?\", but consider to held up a \\'\\'\\'\"BELGIQUE/BELGIE\"-\\'\\'\\'- ,\\'\\'\\'\"B\"\\'\\'\\'- or \\'\\'\\'\"GAND/GENT\"\\'\\'\\'-sign.\\n\\n\\n;Alternatives\\nYou can avoid getting stuck in Lille by getting out at the last petrol station on the A1 on \\'\\'« Aire de Phalempin »\\'\\' is quite a big station, good for hitching, and it\\'s 15 km due south from the centre. However, in direction of Brussels it might be a bit difficult there. Most people go towards Ghent and Antwerp there.\\n\\nOtherwise, take the tram-line T to Chateau Rouge. As you get out, you can see the motorway. The spot is the motorway slip road. There\\'s not a lot of traffic, but there is space for drivers to safely pull over and pick you up.\\n\\n* \\'\\'\\'Update April 2019\\'\\'\\'To go to north on the A22-E17 stop at the \"cerisaie centre d\\'affaires\" tramway spot one the T blue line. Immediatly after the tramway stop there is a traffic light stopping cars witch can go on the motorway slope. There are few transborder workers so it is quite a good stop, even if there is not a lot of traffic and the red light is not very long. ATTENTION do not be dropped in the \"rekkem\" rest area immediatly after the belgium border, there are only trucks and you can easely be trapped here. Aim for the \"marke\" service station after the E17-E403 junction.\\n\\nOr else, get to the petrol station on the N356 about 800m north of metro station Monts Sarts. (Need to jump a small fence and a 2 meter drop! There is a place for your foot so you can slide and jump, but it is still quite a wall). From here you can find lifts going into Belgium and have the chance to talk to drivers. \\n\\n* \\'\\'\\'Update January 2022\\'\\'\\'The gas station is currently closed (due to construction?). If you want to get there, try to find information if it\\'s reopened.\\n\\nThe \\'\\'\\'French/Belgian border\\'\\'\\' is not a good spot anymore. It is now just a big parking lot where trucks stop, all sign of the previous building there have vanished, it is hard to hitch on the highway as hardly any car stops there. \\nTo get there you\\'ll have to take the Line 2 of the metro until \"C. H. Dron\" (last stop, and actually already in Tourcoing, not in Lille). And walk 30 to 45 Min to it there is an access road with to fence or barrier stopping people on foot. You might be able to get a ride to the petrol station 5 km into Belgium at Kortrijk where loads of Netherland folk stop for a refill.\\n\\n=== Going east? Take the A27 towards [[Tournai ]](= Doornik in Flemish), [[Brussels]] ===\\n\\n;Alternative 1\\nGetting on the A27 by feet from the centre of Lille is several kilometers. A good option is go to \"metro station « 4 Cantons »\". From there it is about 500 meters to a roundabout which is situated west of the N227, where the D146 (a part of this D146 is called \"\\'\\'Rue Nicolas Appert\\'\\'\") is crossing the this N227 (which carries the name \"\\'\\'Boulevard du Breucq\\'\\'\", and is part of the E17). Avoid the working hours and days: this entrance to the highway has a lot of traffic sometimes, and not so much room for a car to stop safely. It is better to do it early in the morning.\\nHave a \\'\\'\\'\"TOURNAI\"-sign\\'\\'\\'. Why? Because many cars take the direction of [[Valenciennes]] instead.\\n\\n\\'\\'September 2017: [[User:Roelguldemond|roel guldemond]] dropped Nati, from Argentina, at this roundabout 11h00 in the morning. She claimed to found a hitch in 5 minutes.\\n\\'\\'January 2022: Thomi found a hitch there in less than 10 minutes at 07h30. but an other time, no one stopped in two hours of waiting at 11h00\\'\\'\\n\\'\\'\\'\\n\\n;Alternative 2\\nThe first gas station on this highway, \\'\\'Aire de Froyennes\\'\\', is right before Tournai. To get there, you can also take a regional train from Lille, Pont de Bois, Ascq or Baisieux to Froyennes. The border crossing by train is very expensive, so the best way to get there safe is to have an Ilevia train ticket (1.70 EUR), which is valid in the whole territory of the European Metropolis of Lille (MEL). Once the train crosses the border, just hope that the controller won\\'t show up - worse case, use your best acting skills to pretend that you thought Froyennes was part of the metropolis.\\nIt is a very quiet village in which you\\'ll have to walk around 15 minutes to reach the gas station. From there, most of the cars go to Brussels but you can easily find a hitch to the main Wallonian cities ([[Mons]], [[Charleroi]], [[Namur]], [[Liège]]).\\n\\'\\'(January 2022 Thomi put his thumb up, and the second car stopped and proposed a ride to Brussels)\\'\\'\\n\\n\\n=== Going Northwest? Take the A25 towards [[Dunkerque]], [[Calais]], [[London]] (see [[English channel]] crossing) ===\\nSee above, going north: \\nGo to \\'\\'metro station « Porte de Postes »\\'\\'. Here is a big roundabout. It\\'s possible to get a ride in several directions. Westwards : direction Calais/Dunkerque (via A25).\\nFor those going to Calais or Britain, the last gas station is Aire de Saint Laurent, located northeast from the town of Steenvorde. Make sure to stop there to avoid being stranded in Dunkerque.\\n\\n--[[User:Roelguldemond|Roelguldemond]] ([[User talk:Roelguldemond|talk]]) 12:19, 11 December 2013 (CET)\\n\\'\\'Comment by Roel september 2017 : I edited this page intensively.

It\\'s a major transportation hub in Peru, and it is difficult to travel from the north of Peru to the south without passing through Lima. \\n\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n\\n=== North towards [[Trujillo]], [[Ecuador]] (Panamericana Norte, 1N) ===\\n\\nThe best place to hitch a ride north is the Ancon Tollbooth. Go to Terminal Terrestre Plaza Norte and take a bus going to Huaral (S/6 as of 9/2018) and ask to get of off at the \\'\\'peaje Ancon\\'\\'. Alternatively, there are micros that go to Ancón for S/2.5 from the Panamericana Norte in the Rimac district of Lima, but they will drop you off at a truck weigh station, a few kilometers before the tollbooth. You can try hitching from there or ask any truck to take you to the tollbooth. All trucks and buses heading north use this tollbooth to leave Lima.\\n\\nAnother option is the roundabout within the Ancón. You can get a lift here within 5 minutes. Traffic is slow here and there is plenty of space to stop. However, not all traffic goes along this route as there is a junction between the above mentioned weigh station and Ancón. Most of the cars will bypass the city which results in only being able to hitch lifts with trucks from this spot.\\n\\n\\n=== East towards [[Huancayo]] ===\\n\\nFrom Avenida Central in Lima there are many small buses that go to Chosica, which is almost an hour outside of the metropolis. Still it leaves you in what seems to be a bad hitching spot full of traffic jams and people, but the use of a sign and the trusty thumb makes it possible to catch a ride even in this place. IMPORTANT NOTE: if you´re heading towards Cuzco, you might want to reconsider taking the Panamericana route! For more information check out the description of Huancayo-Ayacucho-Cuzco road.\\n\\n\\n=== South towards [[Ica]], [[Nazca]], [[Cusco]], [[Chile]] (Panamericana, 1S) ===\\n\\nA good spot to start hitchhiking the Panamericana in direction South is the toll station in Lima\\'s Villa El Salvador District. To get there, go to any bus stop on the Southern Panamericana within Lima (e.g. the crossing with Primavera or Avenida Alfonso Benavides) and take a combi going direction Lurín/Pachacamac.\\n\\n\\n=== Northeast towards [[Huanuco]] ===\\n\\nFor some reason, possibly because of superior road quality, most trucks seem to take the road which passes through Chosica.  So take a bus to Chosica and figure it out from there.  Don\\'t attempt to use Peaje Ancón to get there - it\\'s mostly dirt roads with little traffic.  \\n\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|Peru}}\\n[[Category:Peru]]',\n",

The location can be found on the map by searching for Avenue Georges Guingouin. At one end of the avenue, there is a roundabout separated by a second roundabout only by a bridge crossing the highway. The first roundabout is the starting point.\\n\\nFrom here, walk towards the entrance ramp to the highway, and you’ll find a large emergency lane where you can wait. The spot allows for easy hitchhiking, and it took only 15 minutes before finding a ride to Paris, including trucks that can stop here! Though it may seem dangerous, as it\\'s a bend, most cars don\\'t drive fast, and there is plenty of space on the emergency lane.\\n\\n=== West towards [[Angoulême]], [[Niort]], [[La Rochelle]] ===\\n==== Option 1 - Rue Armand Dutreix ====\\nThere are several traffic lights and spaces to park on Rue Armand Dutreix.

Cars will go either through the A2 towards the south (Algarve), or the A6 towards east (Évora and Spain).\\n\\nCheck out all the petrol station on [[A2 (Portugal)|A2]] motorway and [[A6 (Portugal)|A6]] (towards [[Spain]]).\\n\\n====Option 3====\\nCatch the \\'\\'Feragus\\'\\' train to \\'\\'Fogueteiro\\'\\' station. This station is adjacent to the [[A2 (Portugal)|A2]] highway. Exit on the south side and follow the footpath around the nearby buildings (you should be able to follow other passengers). Turn right and cross the bridge. From here you can hitch near the on-ramp or illegally on the highway itself a there is plenty of space for cars to stop in the emergency lane. This is a good spot to catch a lift south to the [[Algarve]] or east towards [[Spain]]. However keep in mind highway patrol near metropolitan areas such as Lisbon are far less patient with hitchhikers than their rural counterparts.\\n\\n=== West to [[Sintra]], [[Cabo da Roca]] ===\\n{{Coords|38.7366|-9.1719}}<br>\\nGo to the train station \\'\\'Sete Rios\\'\\' (by train or by metro to \\'\\'Jardim Zoologico\\'\\'). Leave the train station in direction of [[Campolide]] (South) and when you take the southern exit go straight (follow the street over some kind of bridge), turn right at the crossing and you will see the motorway in front of you. Go behind the bridge to the roundabout, you\\'ll see the directions towards Sintra. Plenty of space and cars go not to fast. You will get on the IC19 going all the way to Sintra. If you don\\'t get a direct lift try to hitch from exit to exit.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n{{IsIn|Portugal}}\\n[[Category:City\\'s]]\\n[[Category:Portugal]]\\n[[Category:E80]]\\n[[Category:E1]]\\n[[Category:E90]]\\n[[de:Lissabon]]\\n[[pt:Lisboa]]',\n",

The best place to stand is at the beginning of the A550. To get there, take a bus down the A41, or take a train to Hooton station, then follow the signs saying \\'North Wales\\' (the A550 is about 20 minutes walk from the station). There is a petrol station, but don\\'t bother trying it as no traffic going towards Wales seems to use it. Hitch on the A550 itself - it is a good road, but is very narrow. There is an OK spot next to the church behind the petrol station, or you can walk for five minutes to a road junction where you have more space and better visibility.\\n\\nHitching the M53 from the city centre is a complete headache & not recommended. \\n\\n\\n=== East on the M62 to [[Manchester]], [[Leeds]] & the M6 North & South to [[Birmingham]] ===\\n\\nTake a train or a bus to the station called \"Broadgreen\". More close to the big road junction, before the motorway starts, there\\'s a bus stop \"{{Maps place|5378|Broadgreen, The Rocket PH (opp)}}\". \\n\\nIf you want to turn to the M6, it might be a good idea to jump out at the {{Maps place|7020|Burtonwood Services}} and ask for rides.\\n\\n\\n=== North via M6 ===\\n\\nTake a train to the Station \"Old Roan\" and walk a further 0.8 miles to the ramp at Dunnings Bridge Road. Where the road splits to the M58 and Maghull you can cross the road (one way medium traffic) and stay there with a sign (e.g. Preston) at the start of the M58. Cars are at medium speed but there is plenty of space to stop.\\n\\nBefore you reach the place above is also a traffic light where you can stay with a sign or ask drivers, but as it is a two-lane road and splits soon after most cars will be on the wrong side.\\n\\n\\n== Places to Visit ==\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Lark Lane\\'\\'\\': Toxeth, South-East Liverpool. Full of colourful, cheap bars with the paint coming off the walls. Good Music on the stereo & wonderful conversation with those crazy scouscers <br>\\n\\'\\'\\'Sefton Park\\'\\'\\': Right off Lark lane. Weather providing of course, but Sefton Park is rather beautiful with it\\'s man-made waterfalls and victorian glass dome greenhouses. Also met some rather interesting people there, on a sunny day some of the young trendy types will go and sit around on the main field. <br>\\n\\'\\'\\'Penny Lane\\'\\'\\': For the Beatles fans, there\\'s a Penny Lane murial and a museum, HOWEVER, Paul Mcartney actually wrote the song about Allerton Road, the road that Penny Lane comes off. There\\'s still a barber shop and lots of great places to eat, Bakeries and all-day English breakfasts. <br>\\n\\'\\'\\'John Lennon\\'s Childhood home\\'\\'\\' is 251 Menlove Avenue, about a fourty minute walk from Penny Lane. Worth seeing. <br>\\n\\'\\'\\'The Razz:\\'\\'\\' A real cultural experience, the most dank, disgusting pub on the face of the planet, with a dance floor downstairs playing awful mainstream music until four in the morning. However, a pint of lager is 90p, yes 90p! and shots are dirt cheap as well .You\\'ll be sure to have at least five, maybe six, completely idiotic drunken discussions with intoxicated students. 108 Seel Street, Merseyside, Liverpool L1 4BL.\\n\\n== Other Useful Info ==\\n\\nAt the Liverpool World Museum there are free storage lockers, with a 1GBP deposit.\\n\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n[[Category:England]]\\n[[Category:United Kingdom]]\\n[[Category:E20]]',\n",

On the other hand it is not impossible to get lifts along the former transit-route of the E25 straight through the city of Liege alongside the Maas-river. Provided you are familiar which used to be the pre-motorway era transit route you can quite successfully hitch out of Liege along that transit route using a sign Lux(embourg) or Arlon heading towards the Ardennes, or a sign Vise, Maastr(icht) or NL heading north.

If you go towards Aachen and Köln, best is to use a sign with \"Barchon\", where is the first petrol station (which you could also reach by bus, see below). \\n\\n=== Heading East towards [[Aachen]] (A3) {{E|42}} ===\\nBus 67 from Gare Leopold direction Vise until busstop Carrefour in Barchon; this is the busstop just after crossing the A3-motorway. The ride is about 34 minutes. From the busstop walk back over the motorway (bridge), then go southeast on the N604 Champs de Tignee.

Stand with your sign in the middle between the two lanes, or on the pavement next to the parking place entrance.

You can also take bus no 2 to \"Nove Jarše\" from Southern part of Slovenska cesta.

It is the way that is used by most of those numerous Germans that go to the Croatian coast for hollidays.\\n\\nThis motorway E61/A2 starts from the Ljubljana bypass. The best way to join this motorway is from the street Celovška cesta, at the bus stop Šentvid (stand in the corner before the bus stop!!). Get there by bus number 1 (direction Vižmarje), 25 (dir. Medvode), or 8 (dir. Gameljne) from the city centre. If people who pick you up don\\'t go as far as you like, you can get a lift as far as the first \"Petrol\" gas station on the highway (17km away) or the former toll station Torovo and keep hitchhiking there. There is also a petrol station at the Radovljica-exit (right before Bled) which is useful for getting into Austria. Another option is to get dropped  at ~25km from Šentvid, there\\'s a great hitchhiking spot [https://goo.gl/maps/d4kMoNHzbEYPRT9d7 here] on a ramp where there\\'s enough room for a car to stop (GPS 46.267470, 14.339623).\\n\\n=== Southwest towards [[Koper]], [[Nova Gorica]], [[Rijeka]], [[Pula]] ([[Croatia]]), ([[Italy]]) {{E|61}} ===\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1: Rest stop Barje - North (Avtocestno počivališče Barje - Sever)\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nCatch bus 1 to bus stop \"Tbilisijska\", continue walking in the same direction and turn left at the roundabout.

Just ask people at the gas station.\\nThere is a shower in fuel station for 3 eur and places for wild camping around.\\n\\nIf your destination is Venice or further, the easiest way is via Nova Gorica (town on the walkable distance from Gorizia, Italy): use sign GO and ask to be dropped at the service area on the border. For Trieste it doesn\\'t work well with TS sign - best option might be to use Koper sign and then ask the driver to drop you off at Kozina exit (go right in the crossroads after toll booths). It\\'s only 3 km from the border and on the main Rijeka-Trieste road.\\n\\nIf your destination is Rijeka, take also rides going to Postojna or further west. Get out at Postojna exit and walk across the highway from there (use the bridge). There is a good spot to hitchhike southwards just few hundred meters after the bridge.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2: Highway entrance Dolgi Most\\'\\'\\'\\n\\n[[File:DSCI0054.JPG|right|thumb|334px|Hitchhiking spot \\'\\'Dolgi most\\'\\']]\\n\\nFrom the city centre (Dunajska cesta, Slovenska cesta) take the bus number 6, 1, 1D (direction Dolgi most) or 6B (dir. Notranje gorice), to bus stop \"Dolgi Most\". You will be dropped off on a large parking lot right next to a motorway bridge. There is also a Bicike(lj) (bike rental) station nearby, if you prefer it to taking the bus. On the opposite side of the road, there is a busy motorway entrance with a great hitchhiking spot where cars can easily see you and stop safely.\\n\\nApril 2024: After the reconstruction the entrance is not as good for hichhiking as before, since drivers need to turn into a \"locals only\" street. Nevertheless it is still a safe spot with a lot of passing traffic.\\n\\nSeptember 2024: I was able to get a ride to Postonja from here within 5 minutes in a rainstorm. It looked like a not very ideal spot but it worked. The above mentioned spot in Postonja worked very well for getting towards Rijeka. If you do not feel comfortable crossing the bridge in a sidewalk or shoulder (which I didn\\'t want to do in a rainstorm) it\\'s possible with a roughly 40 minute diversion to find a pedestrian underpass to the west and then looping down to the above-mentioned spot.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3: Fuel station on the road to highway\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nNear the crossing of streets: \"Pot Na Rakovo Jelšo\" and \"Barjanska Cesta\" there is a fuel station with a lot of cars heading towards Koper.\\n\\n=== Southeast towards [[Novo mesto]], [[Zagreb]] ([[Croatia]]) {{Aat|2}} ===\\n\\n[[File:Hhspottowardszagreb.jpg|right|thumb|334px|Hitchhiking spot for direction: Zagreb]]\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1: Rest stop Barje - South (Jug)\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nThis service area is on the Ring around Ljubljana and is very well-served by a lot of long-distance drivers. To get there take a bus number 1 or 1B in direction of \"Dolgi most\" from the center. Get off the bus on the stop \"Mestni Log\" and walk back in the direction of the highway. When you reach the overpass look for a very small and steep pathway on your right, starting next to the overpass. Descend down to the fence, turn right and walk a few metres untill you reach an unlocked door. When you\\'re on the other side of the fence, you should already be able to see the rest stop. Follow the pathway for another 100 m or so and there you are. There is a shower for 3€, food and places for wildcamping around.\\n\\n* [[User:MartinJ888|MartinJ888]] August 2022: Works very well. The door is still unlocked! Took us about 1 hour to get a ride, asking people.\\n\\n*[[User:JackMcJackJack|JackMcJackJack]] August 2023: This gas station and has been demolished and people rarely stop here, avoid this place. The on ramp beside the Lidl on Pot Rdečega križa is a 20min walk away from Mestni Log bus station. Most people here are heading south, but we found a ride to Šmarje - Sap gas station after an hour.\\n\\nNovember 2024: Reconstruction is finished and the rest stop is open again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2: Highway entrance Barjanska cesta\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nCatch bus 9 in direction of \"Barje\" from the center or the train station and exit on the final stop \"Barje\". You can hitchhike next to the parking lot or walk down the \"barjanska\" street and try to find a better place. That\\'s the entrance people from Ljubljana would use to enter the highway going south, so this spot might be less suitable for long distance picks, but perfect to get you to Novo Mesto.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3: Highway entrance Rudnik\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nNot many cars go in this direction, and the ones that do usually do not enter the motorway here - this on-ramp mostly serves inter-urban traffic, so you might have to wait a bit longer. From the city centre take a bus line 3 in direction of \"Rudnik\", and get off at the final stop. In front of you there will be the motorway entrance. Cross the street and on the side of the on-ramp road, on your left, you will see a small asphalt surface where all the cars pass, and there you can stand and hitchhike easily. Pay attention that you\\'re hitchhiking on the highway entrance (the left turn) and not on the old road (Dolenjska cesta), which is continuing straight ahead. Drivers going to Kočevje and Ribnica use this entrance.\\n\\n== Transportation ==\\n\\nLjubljana is a very walkable and cyclable city, so those two are best options to move around. I highly recommend the bike share system \\'\\'\\'Bicike(lj)\\'\\'\\', used daily by many locals. It costs only 1€ for a weekly subscription (and 3€ for the whole year). You can use the bikes unlimitedly 24/7, the 1st hour of every use is free. Definitely the cheapest and most comfortable option, download the BicikeLJ app for use.\\nAnother option is taking the busses, payment is possible on the bus with a credit card - one 90 min ride costs 1.3€. In case of credit card payment changing the busses is not possible (every change will cost another 1.3€). Another option is to use the app Urbana or buying the city card.\\n\\n== Sleeping ==\\n\\nThe best option in a walkable distance from the city centre would be park Tivoli. It is huge so you can easily find a good place to hide and set up your tent somewhere. People often drink there in the evening so it might be a good idea to sleep in or at least close to the forest, so nobody will bother you.\\n\\nEdit: if you go to the forest behind Tivoli, be prepared for it is steep. Go there during daylight and plan in enough time to find a suitable spot. If you go until the bag side of the park (just before the forest starts) and go west you\\'ll reach a little staircase out of stone. Climb it and you\\'ll find a calm spot to spend the night \\n\\nAnother place is up the castle, close to the antena. Just follow the path going away from the castle entrance and it will take you to a small meadow and a small forrest. There is a bigger chance to be spotted here.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[[Category:Slovenia]]\\n[[Category:E70]]\\n[[Category:E61]]\\n[[Category:E57]]\\n\\n[[de:Ljubljana]]',\n",

It looked like a not very ideal spot but it worked. The above mentioned spot in Postonja worked very well for getting towards Rijeka. If you do not feel comfortable crossing the bridge in a sidewalk or shoulder (which I didn\\'t want to do in a rainstorm) it\\'s possible with a roughly 40 minute diversion to find a pedestrian underpass to the west and then looping down to the above-mentioned spot.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3: Fuel station on the road to highway\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nNear the crossing of streets: \"Pot Na Rakovo Jelšo\" and \"Barjanska Cesta\" there is a fuel station with a lot of cars heading towards Koper.\\n\\n=== Southeast towards [[Novo mesto]], [[Zagreb]] ([[Croatia]]) {{Aat|2}} ===\\n\\n[[File:Hhspottowardszagreb.jpg|right|thumb|334px|Hitchhiking spot for direction: Zagreb]]\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1: Rest stop Barje - South (Jug)\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nThis service area is on the Ring around Ljubljana and is very well-served by a lot of long-distance drivers. To get there take a bus number 1 or 1B in direction of \"Dolgi most\" from the center. Get off the bus on the stop \"Mestni Log\" and walk back in the direction of the highway. When you reach the overpass look for a very small and steep pathway on your right, starting next to the overpass. Descend down to the fence, turn right and walk a few metres untill you reach an unlocked door. When you\\'re on the other side of the fence, you should already be able to see the rest stop. Follow the pathway for another 100 m or so and there you are. There is a shower for 3€, food and places for wildcamping around.\\n\\n* [[User:MartinJ888|MartinJ888]] August 2022: Works very well. The door is still unlocked! Took us about 1 hour to get a ride, asking people.\\n\\n*[[User:JackMcJackJack|JackMcJackJack]] August 2023: This gas station and has been demolished and people rarely stop here, avoid this place. The on ramp beside the Lidl on Pot Rdečega križa is a 20min walk away from Mestni Log bus station. Most people here are heading south, but we found a ride to Šmarje - Sap gas station after an hour.\\n\\nNovember 2024: Reconstruction is finished and the rest stop is open again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2: Highway entrance Barjanska cesta\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nCatch bus 9 in direction of \"Barje\" from the center or the train station and exit on the final stop \"Barje\". You can hitchhike next to the parking lot or walk down the \"barjanska\" street and try to find a better place. That\\'s the entrance people from Ljubljana would use to enter the highway going south, so this spot might be less suitable for long distance picks, but perfect to get you to Novo Mesto.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3: Highway entrance Rudnik\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nNot many cars go in this direction, and the ones that do usually do not enter the motorway here - this on-ramp mostly serves inter-urban traffic, so you might have to wait a bit longer. From the city centre take a bus line 3 in direction of \"Rudnik\", and get off at the final stop. In front of you there will be the motorway entrance. Cross the street and on the side of the on-ramp road, on your left, you will see a small asphalt surface where all the cars pass, and there you can stand and hitchhike easily. Pay attention that you\\'re hitchhiking on the highway entrance (the left turn) and not on the old road (Dolenjska cesta), which is continuing straight ahead. Drivers going to Kočevje and Ribnica use this entrance.\\n\\n== Transportation ==\\n\\nLjubljana is a very walkable and cyclable city, so those two are best options to move around. I highly recommend the bike share system \\'\\'\\'Bicike(lj)\\'\\'\\', used daily by many locals. It costs only 1€ for a weekly subscription (and 3€ for the whole year). You can use the bikes unlimitedly 24/7, the 1st hour of every use is free. Definitely the cheapest and most comfortable option, download the BicikeLJ app for use.\\nAnother option is taking the busses, payment is possible on the bus with a credit card - one 90 min ride costs 1.3€. In case of credit card payment changing the busses is not possible (every change will cost another 1.3€). Another option is to use the app Urbana or buying the city card.\\n\\n== Sleeping ==\\n\\nThe best option in a walkable distance from the city centre would be park Tivoli. It is huge so you can easily find a good place to hide and set up your tent somewhere. People often drink there in the evening so it might be a good idea to sleep in or at least close to the forest, so nobody will bother you.\\n\\nEdit: if you go to the forest behind Tivoli, be prepared for it is steep. Go there during daylight and plan in enough time to find a suitable spot. If you go until the bag side of the park (just before the forest starts) and go west you\\'ll reach a little staircase out of stone. Climb it and you\\'ll find a calm spot to spend the night \\n\\nAnother place is up the castle, close to the antena. Just follow the path going away from the castle entrance and it will take you to a small meadow and a small forrest. There is a bigger chance to be spotted here.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[[Category:Slovenia]]\\n[[Category:E70]]\\n[[Category:E61]]\\n[[Category:E57]]\\n\\n[[de:Ljubljana]]'},\n",

These regions are part of the [[London]] commuter belt and include in part or totally the following counties:\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Bedfordshire:\\'\\'\\' [[Luton]] (London Luton Airport)\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Cambridgeshire:\\'\\'\\' [[Cambridge]], [[Peterborough]]\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Essex:\\'\\'\\' [[Colchester]], [[Southend-on-Sea]]\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hertfordshire:\\'\\'\\' [[Stevanage]], [[Bishop\\'s Stortford]] / [[London Stansted]] (Airport)\\n\\n\\n== Hitchhiking in ==\\n\\nLondon has a motorway ring-road, the [[M25 (GB)|M25]].\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Get dropped off on or near the M25 and use the public transport to get wherever you need.\\'\\'\\' If you are coming from the west and your driver is heading south on the M25, ask to be dropped off at the first junction on the M25: Heathrow Terminal 5. Get off at the roundabout at the end of the motorway spur and walk to the terminal building. The Piccadilly Line Underground starts here. If they are heading north, see the description for getting to Uxbridge Underground station below.<br/ >\\nIf you are coming from the southeast on the M20, ask to be dropped off at the A20/M20/M25 roundabout. From here you can take the B2173 road 2km to Swanley train station. Alternatively, if they are heading further north, get dropped off at the M25/A12 junction and walk ≈3km west to Harold Wood station.<br/ >\\nIf you\\'re coming from the north and your driver is heading towards the M4/M3 direction, try to persuade them to do a slight detour off the M25 to junction 1 of the M40 (roundabout with A40). From there, it\\'s a ≈2km walk to Uxbridge Underground station. Otherwise, get off at the last services (Toddington) before the M25 and look for a lift going inside the ring road.<br/ >\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Hitch into London from the last services on your motorway before the M25 (the driver will usually know which one this is).\\'\\'\\' Then try to find a ride that bring you close enough to your destination. Check \"public transport\" for navigating the system efficiently and cheaply.\\n\\nSee the transiting around the M25 section below if you just want to bypass London.\\n\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\nHitchhiking out of London is pretty tricky, but not impossible - the big problem is getting onto a motorway is a bit of a challenge, once you\\'re on the motorway, stick to the petrol stations, hitching entrance ramp to entrance ramp is quite difficult, especially in the big cities.\\n\\n\\n=== West towards [[Reading]], [[Swindon]], ([[South West England|The South-West]]), [[Bristol]], [[South West England|Devon]], [[South West England|Cornwall]] [[South Wales]] {{Mgb|4}} ===\\n\\nWhen hitching West out of London and onto the M4, to try to avoid accepting a ride to anywhere before Reading Central. A few of the earlier junctions are hitchhiking nightmare spots - junction 8,9 for Maidenhead and 10 for Reading East are two of the worst junctions for hitchhiking in this area of the country because of the M4 then turning into another motorway for a few miles, thus taking you well off your route. Reading Services is great though, and well worth encouraging your driver to take you the extra few miles to. \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\': M4 Motorway Junction 1 (Chiswick Roundabout)\\n\\nA. Take the District Line Underground to \\'\\'Gunnersbury\\'\\' (zone 3)  or train to \\'\\'Kew Bridge\\'\\'. (Alternatively, the Overground at \\'\\'South Acton\\'\\' doesn\\'t have barriers, but is a kilometer further away.) Both stations are on the Chiswick High Road (A315 - one west and one east of the roundabout) along which you walk 500m to Junction 1 of the M4 where you will see the Esso petrol station that is on the corner of the slip road onto the motorway heading west. There is a bus lay-by nearby with a sign saying M4 west.\\n\\nB. Take bus H91 from \\'\\'Hammersmith Bus station\\'\\' in the direction of Hounslow West and get off at \\'\\'Chiswick Roundabout/Gunnersbury\\'\\', and you are already at the bus lay-by hitching point.\\n\\nCost of public transport: £2.80 (off peak) from Zone 1. (Bus fare £1.50)\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\': A4 leading to M4 (or M3)\\n\\nHeading for [[South West England|Cornwall]], it is much easier hitching the M4 and changing to the M5 in [[Bristol]] than trying to hitch the M3 through \\n[[South West England|Dorset]].\\n\\nTake District Line Underground to \\'\\'West Kensington\\'\\' (zone 2). Turn right out of the station, there are traffic lights 10m away. Turn right and there is a lay-by where you can stand. The advantage of this spot is that all the traffic must stop here frequently for the lights and much of it is going to either of the motorways. (It\\'s also cheaper to get to). \\n\\nCost of public transport: £2.40 (off peak) from Zone 1.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3\\'\\'\\': Motorway service station Heston\\n\\nTake Piccadilly Line Underground westbound and get off at \\'\\'Hounslow West\\'\\' (zone 5). Turn right from the station exit and walk 800m west along Bath Road to just past Henleys roundabout where there is a BP petrol station. Right at the exit of the petrol station is a footpath heading north. Walk ≈650m and where it splits, turn right 20 metres until you reach Armytage Rd. Turn left onto this road and continue north for another ≈200m, cross over Cranford Lane and then continue north again for another ≈350m along Phoenix Way until it bends to the left. Just past the bend, you will see a short path on the right through the bushes/trees onto Heston service station.\\nIt\\'s not an overly busy services but enough traffic to justify getting out here and cutting out all the local traffic in the centre. Use a sign as there is a lot of local traffic and also traffic heading onto the M25 both south and north.\\n\\nCost of public transport: £3.10 (off peak) from Zone 1\\n\\n\\n=== Southeast towards [[South East England|The South East]], [[Maidstone]], [[Folkestone]] ([[Channel Tunnel]]), [[Dover]] (Ferries to Europe) {{Mgb|20}} ===\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\': Mottingham \\n\\nTake the train from \\'\\'Charing Cross Station\\'\\' (Zone 1) to \\'\\'Mottingham Station\\'\\' (Zone 4). It passes through \\'\\'Waterloo East\\'\\' (Zone 1), \\'\\'London Bridge\\'\\' (Zone 1), \\'\\'New Cross\\'\\' (Zone 2) and \\'\\'Lewisham\\'\\' (Zone 2) stations on its way to \\'\\'Dartford\\'\\' or \\'\\'Gillingham\\'\\'. Alternatively, take the Jubilee line to North Greenwich, and from there, the 161 bus to Mottingham. When you come out of the train station, walk 100m south along Court Road to the intersection with Sidcup Road (A20). At the traffic lights turn left, where you will see a Shell petrol station.<br/ >\\n\\nCost of public transport:  train to Mottingham was £5. \\n\\nThe best ride to accept from Mottingham is one that brings you directly into the South-East along the M20 and past the M20/M25 junction, most likely to the [[Maidstone Services]]. Many drivers have said that many hitch-hikers happen to stand and hitch at the M20/M25 junction, but the police might be more likely to pick you up. \\n\\nCost of public transport: £2.80 (off-peak) from zone 1. (Mottingham train station doesn\\'t have barriers...)<br/ >\\n\\nNOTE: The most classic method departing London in the direction of continental Europe begins in Mottingham. Most traffic is local, thus it is best to ask people whether they are going onto the M25 ring road. If yes, they will passby the BP @ Swanley as described in option 2. The next major service station after Swanley is after the M25 called Maidstone Services on the M20 Junction 8; be sure to find a ride that exits at junction 8 as the main exit for the town of Maidstone is junction 7. This is the last major service station located before Dover and it is recommended to find a ride directly onto the train or ferry from here. \"I have hitched across the channel many times from Maidstone, with waits ranging from 30 seconds to as long as 6 hours.\"\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\': BP petrol station on Swanley Bypass (A20)\\n\\nThe easiest way to get here is to take a train to Sidcup, then take the 233 city bus towards Swanley and get off at Old Maidstone Road. The service station will be about two minutes\\' walk down and across the road. There is a gate in the fence, though it may be closed in which case you\\'ll have to jump the fence.\\n\\nAnother way to get here is to take a train from \\'\\'London Victoria\\'\\' to \\'\\'Swanley\\'\\'. Some trains will go directly there, otherwise change at Bromley South. (There is also a direct train from St. Pancras to Swanley, but it cost £8.80 (peak) in Nov 2015, so might as well just get a megabus if you\\'re going to pay that much). From the station, cross the tracks with the pedestrian bridge to Everest Place, turn right on St. Mary\\'s  Rd to the roundabout at London Road. From here, turn left (north) along London Road/ Maidstone Road for 2.6kms. Here you\\'ll find the service station behind a fence on the left. It\\'s a longer walk than to the Texaco mentioned below but managed to get a lift there in 15 minutes at 22:00 asking people (September 2013). It seemed most traffic was M20/M25, but might of been the time of night. This is perfect for getting to Maidstone.<br/ >\\n\\nThis service station has a BP petrol station and a McDonald\\'s.\\xa0\\n\\nCost of public transport: One train ticket \\'\\'from zone 1\\'\\' (approximately £3.50 off-peak) or take the train from Elephant & Castle in central south-east (no barriers) towards Seven Oaks for a free ride.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3\\'\\'\\': Texaco petrol station, Swanley\\n\\nSame directions as for Option 2 above, but this time, walk into town from the station, and head to the London Road going south towards M20. On the way there is a Texaco petrol station that seems quite busy. Further down there is a big parking space, with a greasy spoon van if you\\'re hungry or in need of a cup of coffee. The road takes you straight down to the motorway. Make sure that you get a ride going to Maidstone Service Station, because it\\'s after the town so someone going to the town of Maidstone won\\'t pass the service station. If you do get a ride just to the town of Maidstone, there is a good lay-by for hitchhiking on the roundabout that leads to the on ramp to the M20, but you\\'ll have to thumb a ride because there is nowhere to ask people. It works with a sign saying \"M20 4 miles\" to get to the service station. \\n\\nCost of Public Transport: xxx\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 4\\'\\'\\': Motorway service station Clackett Lane (M25)\\n\\nA. Take the train from \\'\\'London Bridge\\'\\' to \\'\\'Oxted\\'\\'. Walk southeast along Station Road to Westerham Road (A25). Turn left (east) and walk 3.5km till the junction with Clackett Lane. Turn left here and walk 1.6km along Clackett Lane to the entrance to the service station (heading East) just after you pass over the M25 motorway bridge.\\n\\nB. Take the train from \\'\\'Victoria\\'\\' to \\'\\'Bromley South\\'\\'. Then take bus 246 south in the direction of Westerham Green and get off at \\'\\'Pilgrims Way\\'\\'. Walk west along Pilgrims Way and then Pilgrims Lane for ≈1.4km until you reach Clackett Lane. Turn left (south) and walk for ≈1km until you reach the entrance to the service station heading East (before crossing over the motorway bridge).\\n\\nCost of Public Transport: You can reach London Bridge by overground from a station without barriers and skip the fare.\\n\\nOption 5: (Experimental) : Sun in the Sands roundabout, direct onto the A2 to Dover. \\nJass passed here the other day and saw what seems to be an ideal spot with a lot of space for vehicles to pull over on the slip road onto the motorway.\\nTake the overline to Blackheath from London Bridge. Follow Montpellier Road past the large Blackheart meadows/ park then up Shooters Hill Road till you get to the roundabout.\\n\\n=== Southeast towards [[South East England|The South East]], [[Hastings]], [[Royal Tunbridge Wells]] A21 ===\\n\\nAdd info pls\\n\\n\\n=== Northwest towards [[Oxford]], [[High Wycombe]], [[Warwick]], [[Birmingham]], [[North Wales]] {{Mgb|40}} ===\\n\\n[[M40 (GB)|M40]] is different from other motorways originating from London, as it starts quite close to M25 as a continuation of the dual-carriageway A40.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\': M40 Junction 1\\n\\nTake a Piccadilly or Metropolitan Line to \\'\\'Uxbridge\\'\\' (Zone 6). Exit the station onto High Street and turn right. Walk until you reach Harefield Road - turn left there, and then right at the next big roundabout. From there follow signs to M40 - you will eventually get to junction 1 slip road, and you can hitch-hike from there (there\\'s also a nice spot at the traffic lights). You might need to cross parts of the road where vehicle will already be flying at motorway speeds - stay safe!!! \\n\\nConfirm with the driver that he is going straight onto the M40, and does not turn onto M25 (London Orbital). Also beware that Junction 2 is not very easy to hitch-hike on (see M40 article).\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\': A40 Junction (Hangar Lane)\\n\\nTake the Central Line tube (West Ruislip branch) to \\'\\'Hangar Lane\\'\\' (zone 3). As you exit into the main hall of the tube station, have a look at the local area map and find the exit for the westbound A40 slip road. Keep walking along the slip road, and then A40. There are two good places to hitch from:\\n\\n1. A bus stop just past the junction with Lynwood Rd. It has a long lay-by, which is a good place to hitch from as long as there\\'s nothing parked there. Legally, it\\'s a \"non-stopping except buses\" lay-by.\\n\\n2. The other place is half a mile further on, a little lay-by with no restrictions. Its good spot and has an advantage of being open to the entire A40 (the Lynwood Rd bus stop has a separation between the incoming slip road and the main carriageway, so you can only be picked up by traffic emerging from North Circular Road, or Lynwood Road).\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3\\'\\'\\': A40 Junction (Hillingdon)\\n\\nTake the Piccadilly or Metropolitan Line tube to \\'\\'Hillingdon\\'\\' (zone 6). As you exit the tube station and go to the end of walkway, turn right and walk until you reach the big traffic light-controlled crossroads of \\'Long Lane\\' and \\'Western Avenue\\' (NOT the A40 Western Avenue). Cross the road, then turn right and continue to the roundabout, whose primary exit is the slip-road to A40. Stand on the grass next to of the hatched area - the hatched area is a good and legal place for a vehicle to stop. The area is also well-lit which makes it a perfect place to hitch at night.\\nIt is advisable to have a sign saying \"Oxford\" or something, as a lot of traffic leaves [[M40 (GB)|M40]] at junction 1a to continue on [[M25 (GB)|M25]].\\nThere is also an Oxford Tube coach stop in Western Avenue/Freezeland Way nearby. If you happen to get really stuck (which I think you won\\'t - I waited only about 12 minutes for a ride on an evening during a post-Christmas season) and only need to get to Oxford, this might be an alternative.<br/ >\\n\\nIf your driver is going to Oxford or somewhere nearby then request to be dropped off at the \\'Welcome Break\\' services just before Wheatley, junction 8A (just a km after junction 8). This is a busy services and easy to find lifts all over the country.\\n\\n\\n=== North towards [[Luton]], [[Milton Keynes]], (\\'\\'\\'\\'\\'[[East Midlands|The East Midlands]]\\'\\'\\'\\'\\'), [[Northampton]], [[Leicester]], [[Derby]], [[Nottingham]], [[Sheffield]], [[Leeds]] {{Mgb|1}} ===\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\': Motorway service station London Gateway\\n\\nTake Northern Line tube to Edgware, and then walk 2.5km: Turn right out of the station onto \\'Station Road\\'. Follow the road along, it turns into \\'Hale Lane\\', keep going, then turn left onto \\'Selvage Lane\\' and keep going, you will then go over a bridge over the M1 and come to a big roundabout \\'Apex Corner\\'. Go down into the subway under the roundabout, and come out on the A1 (\\'Barnet Way), just by the petrol station. Turn left just behind the petrol station onto \\'Ellesmere Avenue\\', this road runs parallel to the high way. Keep walking until you come to a road on your left with a big sign with three symbols, one of which would translate as \\'no access to anyone except authorised vehicles\\' and clearly goes under the motorway. Walk down it and you come to [https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir/51.6136474,-0.2756824/51.6331801,-0.267389/@51.6234134,-0.28321,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m24!4m23!1m20!3m4!1m2!1d-0.2707532!2d51.6182613!3s0x487616bd30b5031d:0x8018c6fc46ad7c0a!3m4!1m2!1d-0.2601509!2d51.6168185!3s0x487616bf7b9c6b11:0x36592f73c8bb24ff!3m4!1m2!1d-0.2554027!2d51.6210173!3s0x487616ea6c84b413:0x4e9825452a0ab13a!3m4!1m2!1d-0.2661023!2d51.6315945!3s0x4876168dfd4886a1:0x9337096bd5773568!1m0!3e2?hl=en London Gateway Services].\\n\\nCost of public transport: £3.10 (off peak) from zone 1.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\': [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=51.572780,+-0.230950&ie=UTF8&z=12&iwloc=addr&om=1 Staples Corner]\\n\\nTake Northern Line tube to \\'\\'Brent Cross\\'\\' (zone 3). From there you follow the \\'North Circular Road\\' westwards for about 1km (along Tilling Road), and you get to the bottom of the M1 (don\\'t get confused with the A1 which also passes nearby, although if this road is more convenient for your destination, you can also hitch from here). After passing the shopping centre, you should see the M1. It is possible to hitch at the first entrance you see, which is the traffic coming off the \\'Westbound North Circular\\' (there is a bus stop just after the slip road joins the North Circular, and a small lay-by further on - both adjacent to the lane for M1). You can also hitch at the traffic lights (see spot on the map to the right) or on the hard shoulder on the on-ramp that slopes up right after those traffic lights.\\n\\nImportant : If you are getting a lift from here, ensure that the driver is driving to at least the next service station (Toddington), which is approximately 50-60 miles from this spot. \\n\\nCost of public transport: xxx\\n\\n[[File:Staples_corner_m1.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Hitching Spot at Staples Corner for M1]]\\n\\n- This place seems to work really well. I get the bus to brent cross and then its about a 10 min walk to this spot. However, it tends to go slightly quicker if you walk 2 minutes more around the roundabout (\\'\\'\\'Staples Corner \\'\\'West\\'\\' \\'\\'\\'). You\\'ll see a railway bridge, go under it and there is a bus stop beside a car repair place (the bus stop itself is near Adrian Avenue and is by the \\'\\'Western\\'\\' side of the railway bridge). It doesn\\'t look like such a great place, but it works quite well if you have a sign. \\n\\n- This is a very good place, however one user recommends right next to the car repair center ( on the right of it )there is entrance for the M1 Motorway which is slightly going upwards before meeting the highway. You may go up and make sure to stand  atleast 100 meters away from the point where cars enter on this road from the redlight behind. Have a sign that says M1. \\n\\n- In case you are going to Edinburgh: once you are at any of the service stations on the motorway, you will find a lot of people going in that direction, i.e. going to Leeds and further. Somewhere north of Leeds, the M1 becomes the A1(M) highway; however, ensure that once you are on this highway going in the direction of Newcastle, and then Edinburgh, you do not get out at the last petrol station before Newcastle.  Get out at the 2nd, 3rd or 4th last petrol station before Newcastle, but not the last one. The second last one has a huge McD and more long-distance traffic than the last one, which has a Burger King and Costa and is just a small petrol station with mostly local traffic from Newcastle coming for petrol. Ensure whoever is taking you drops you off only at a petrol station and not on a country road. After Newcastle, there is only one major/decent petrol station in a town called Alnwick (pronounced \\'Annick\\'). Try finding someone who is going to Edinburgh directly from one of the earlier good McD stations. A better alternative route to Edinburgh is to take the M1, M6, A74(M), and A707; this way, you won\\'t have to bother about McD and Newcastle.\\n\\n\\n=== North towards, [[Stevanage]], [[Peterborough]], [[East Midlands]], [[East of England|The East]], [[Newcastle]], [[North East England|The North East]] {{agb|1}} ===\\n\\nMoat Mount Park bus stop on A1.

Once at the station, turn right and use the subways to cross under the A406. Once on the slip road for the A406 (extending Eastern Avenue), there is a great place for vehicles to pull over. The spot is located just next to the bridge over a canal or river. The traffic will not be coming from A406, but it really is a good place to hitch a ride. It is strongly recommended that you bring a M11 sign with you. \\n\\nCost of public transport: £2.80 (off-peak) from zone 1. Tip: To get to the same part of london, you can also take the Central line to Roding Valley. Here there are no barriers as you exit so if you managed to get into the underground system for free, you can get out for free. It\\'s about a half an hour walk to the start of the M11. For getting into the underground system, you can for example get in at Finsbury Park where there are no barriers either. There are also other stations.\\n\\n\\n=== Southwest towards [[South West England|The South West]], [[Basingstoke]], [[Salisbury]], [[Southampton]], [[Porstmouth]], [[South West England|Dorset]], [[Poole|Bournemouth]] {{Mgb|3}} ===\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\': Lay-by on A316 near Kempton Park\\n\\nTake the train from \\'\\'London Waterloo\\'\\' in the direction of Shepperton and exit at \\'\\'Kempton Park\\'\\' station. Exit the station (do not go on the footbridge), cross the racecourse car park and turn right into Park Road, which goes into the slip road coming off A316. When you reach the A316 itself, walk on the pavement in the opposite direction to the traffic. You will immediately see a lay-by (chances are some lorries will be parked there). You can hitch from there. The position is not perfect, as the road is going downhill, and the traffic is traveling very fast (50-70mph)\\n\\nCost of public transport: One ticket/travelcard to zone 6 + one ticket from \\'\\'Hampton\\'\\' to \\'\\'Kempton Park\\'\\' railway station. \\'\\'\\'Kempton Park\\'\\'\\' station is just outside London Transport Zones (\\'\\'Hampton\\'\\', the previous station on the Waterloo-Shepperton line, is in zone 6), but it has no ticket barriers and the chances of meeting a ticket inspector between \\'\\'Hampton\\'\\' and \\'\\'Kempton Park\\'\\' should be quite remote.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\': A316 Junction with A312\\n\\nTake the train on the same line as above, and get off at \\'\\'Fulwell\\'\\'. Walk south on Wellington Road, and then turn right onto Park Road. Follow this road as it joins the A312 for about 1.5 km in total. Just below the A316 bridge, which you will see ahead of you as you follow the A312, there is a roundabout. The first left turn on this roundabout is an on-ramp for the A316. There is a bus stop and a pedestrian crossing here, and traffic is going uphill, and so is quite slow. One user waited here for about 30 minutes with a sign saying \"M3\". However, other users (see hitchmap.com) reportedly had less luck and recommended rather trying the service station 300 meters west on the A316.\\n\\nCost of public transport: xxx\\n\\n\\n=== Southwest towards [[Porstmouth]], [[Worthing]] A3/{{agb|3}}, & A24 ===\\n\\nWest Lodge bus stop on A3. Buses 85, 265 and 969 stops there. There is also Co-op Roehampton Vale petrol station\\n\\nCost of public transport: xxx\\n\\n\\n=== South towards [[Brighton]] {{Mgb|23}} ===\\n\\nTake a train from \\'\\'Victoria\\'\\', \\'\\'Clapham Junction\\'\\', or \\'\\'London Bridge\\'\\' station to \\'\\'East Croyden\\'\\' (zone 6). From here, take a train to \\'\\'Coulsdon South\\'\\'. Turn left out of the station on Brighton Road and walk 600m to the roundabout. Nearly all the traffic goes to the M23 from here.\\n\\nCost of public transport: £3.80 (off-peak) (£2.70 off-peak from Clapham Junction)\\n\\n\\n=== East towards [[East of England|The East]], [[East of England|Essex]], [[Chelmsford]], [[Colchester]], [[Ipswich]], [[Southend-on-Sea]] A/12 ===\\n\\nTake Hammersmith & City Line or District Line to \\'\\'Bow Road\\'\\' (Zone 2). Walk east for ≈700m along the Bow Road to the roundabout junction with the A12. There are traffic lights here, and a McDonalds across the road. Hitch on the slip road heading north on the A12. You can get lifts from here to Ipswich or Colchester. I waited 20 minutes. It was OK. There is plenty of room for people to stop as there is a bus stop nearby.\\n\\nCost of public transport: £2.40 (off-peak from Zone 1)\\n\\n== Airports ==\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'[[London Gatwick Airport|London Gatwick]]\\'\\'\\' / \\'\\'\\'[[London Stansted|London Stansted]]\\'\\'\\' / \\'\\'\\'[[London Heathrow|London Heathrow]]\\'\\'\\' / \\'\\'\\'[[Luton|London Luton]]\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nPaid transport to and from airports can be expensive. Hitching can be a good alternative. The exits to the airports can also be good places to get lifts to other places. For example, if you get stuck on the western part of the M25, try to get to Heathrow, from there people are going all over the country. If you are coming from Brighton, and trying to get around London, you may get a ride quicker to where you want to go if you get dropped at Gatwick Airport than at Pease Pottage services.\\n\\n\\n== Transiting Greater London ==\\n\\nSince nearly all the motorway networks lead towards London, you probably might have to go through that urban area somehow to reach your destination. The M25 is the ring motorway that surrounds the city and connects with every possible motorway network in all directions. It\\'s recommended to find a lift past London as it\\'s somewhat hard to find somebody going off the M25 in your direction from any of the service stations on the M25. Be careful: there are only 3 service stations, and the entire western section has none at all. It may also be possible to head around the M25 from junction to junction. However, the only problem is that a few of the junctions are really bad in the south, and you can get really stuck as a large part of the traffic is only going round the ring a short distance. If if you do get stuck, try making a sign M25 east or west. So consider waiting for a ride that actually takes you to the road you want to be on, rather than just stopping somewhere at random on the M25.\\n\\n=== South Mimms Services ===\\n\\nSouth Mimms services are in Potters Bar in the northeast of London and are actually just off the M25 at the junction of the A1(M). For some reason, although it\\'s a big services, you can get stuck here for hours. One option, as ever, is to ask people where they\\'re headed... but there are so many directions possible that it could take a long time to find someone headed your way. Standing at the exit of the services is unlikely to work, for whatever reason. Several reports of hours of waiting here mean that you probably need to try something else. If you\\'re going towards the west, you can stand at the ridiculous entrance to the west slip road onto the M25. Although insane, you should be able to get a fast ride out. Have a big sign and someone should be able to at least take you further down the M25 to a better junction, or directly to where you\\'re going, be it to the west or down to Sussex. \\n\\n=== Clacket Lane Services ===\\n\\nClackett Lane services are located in the south of London and are possibly the best place to get lifts on the M25. There is a bridge here to cross from one side to the other, which can be useful to know if, for example, you are trying to hitch from the M4 to Brighton but get a lift with someone who is going to Dover.\\n\\nTake the train from \\'\\'Victoria\\'\\' to \\'\\'Bromley South\\'\\'. Then take bus 246 ([http://www.londonbusroutes.net/times/246Sum.htm timetable here]) south in the direction of Westerham Green and get off at \\'\\'Pilgrims Way\\'\\'. Walk west along Pilgrims Way and then Pilgrims Lane for ≈1.4km until you reach Clackett Lane. Turn left (south) and walk for ≈1km until you reach the entrance to the service station (heading east). Continue walking along Clackett Lane for another 400m over the motorway M25 bridge to reach the entrance for the services heading west.  \\nYou can see where you\\'re going on a map [http://www.motorwayservices.info/clacket_lane_services_m25/googlemap here]. Where it says \"Clacket Wood\" is the service station. There is also a street view of this area on google maps.\\n\\nClacket Lane is an excellent place to hitch to Brighton (Westbound) or Dover (Eastbound) and also fairly good for most other directions as it\\'s a busy station. Best thing is to stand outside the main doors into the station and ask everyone that comes out if they are going your way (\"excuse me, are you by any chance going to Brighton?\")\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n{{Template:Regions England}}\\n{{Excellent}}\\n{{IsIn|England}}\\n\\n[[Category:East of England]]\\n[[Category:South East England]]\\n[[Category:England]]\\n[[Category:United Kingdom]]\\n[[Category:E13]]\\n[[Category:E30]]\\n\\n[[fr:Londres]]\\n[[pl:Londyn]]',\n",

Get off at the [[Capellen]] stop and walk less than 1 km west to some of the biggest petrol stations in Europe! Walk towards the motorway which you can see from the train station and take the first road right alongside the fields. After 5 minutes you will come to the petrol station fence. You can climb over the locked fence, but the top is spiked. It\\'s better to turn right, and walk along the fence for about 250 metres, and climb over it at the first section with a stone-wall. Many truck drivers use this service station.\\n\\n====Motorway exit for Brussels====\\n{{Coords|49.6184|6.0844}}<br>\\nFollow the \\'\\'Route d\\'Arlon\\'\\' to the entry onto the A6/{{E|25}}. This is a walk of about 4km from the town centre. You can also just take the Bus 28 and hop off at \\'\\'Hondseck\\'\\', or the Bus 22 and walk from \\'\\'Maternité\\'\\' (no need for a ticket ). Cars can pull over just before the traffic lights, or at the sliproad. You can get a ride straight to Brussels, or to the above mentioned [[Capellen]] gas station (\\'\\'aire de Capellen\\'\\'), which is just about 10km down the road, and from there you can get rides to about anywhere in Belgium and the Netherlands.\\n\\n====Service station for Liege and the Netherlands====\\nYou have the option of going to the town of [[Martelange]] . This small town is famous for plenty of drivers due to the cheap fuel provided by dozens of service stations for drivers going to the Belgian Limburg, Dutch Limburg, and Aachen, etc. Get train from Luxembourg city station to Arlon. Walk left out of station, keep following the Bastogne road signs towards a roundabout which is a 20 minute walk. Here you can hitchhikin at the junction after the bridge and across from the Fiat car garage. This road goes to Martelange and the North.\\n\\n=== East ([[Trier]], [[Germany]]) ===\\n====The better option====\\nJust walk out of the centre to the \\'\\'Avenue John Fitzgerald Kennedy\\'\\' in direction \\'\\'Kirchberg\\'\\'. You will find many banks, institutes and the Luxembourg fair (LuxExpo) there. You can hitch on every spot where cars can stop on this road and even in side roads and secondary roads which are leading to this avenue. Make sure holding a \\'\\'Trier\\'\\' sign. There are masses of people from \\'\\'Trier\\'\\' working in Luxembourg Kirchberg and especially on working days you won\\'t have to wait long. Hold a \\'\\'Trier\\'\\' sign even if you want to get further, if this is the case, you can be dropped at [[Wasserbillig]] service station on the motorway A1 (see The train option). A sign is very important for making the people from Trier stop, which will be your drivers here.\\n\\nTake the Bus 16 or tram to the stop just before the airport. This stop is next to an entrance to the highway and you can either stand in front of the bus stop with a sign or stand on a little traffic light island at the entrance so that you get all the traffic going towards Trier that is coming from both directions. Get a lift at least as far as the huge petrol station on the border, and then it is easier to hitch further.\\n\\n====The train option====\\n{{Coords|49.7265|6.4921}}<br>\\nGet the [[Trier]]/[[Wasserbillig]] (line 30) train from Luxembourg City station. Get off at the Wasserbillig stop. You should turn right outside the train station, walking up the road and turning left up the \\'\\'Route d\\'Echternach\\'\\' until you reach a crossing beside a big river.

Get off at the [[Capellen]] stop and walk less than 1 km west to some of the biggest petrol stations in Europe! Walk towards the motorway which you can see from the train station and take the first road right alongside the fields. After 5 minutes you will come to the petrol station fence. You can climb over the locked fence, but the top is spiked. It\\'s better to turn right, and walk along the fence for about 250 metres, and climb over it at the first section with a stone-wall. Many truck drivers use this service station.\\n\\n====Motorway exit for Brussels====\\n{{Coords|49.6184|6.0844}}<br>\\nFollow the \\'\\'Route d\\'Arlon\\'\\' to the entry onto the A6/{{E|25}}.

Cars can pull over just before the traffic lights, or at the sliproad. You can get a ride straight to Brussels, or to the above mentioned [[Capellen]] gas station (\\'\\'aire de Capellen\\'\\'), which is just about 10km down the road, and from there you can get rides to about anywhere in Belgium and the Netherlands.\\n\\n====Service station for Liege and the Netherlands====\\nYou have the option of going to the town of [[Martelange]] . This small town is famous for plenty of drivers due to the cheap fuel provided by dozens of service stations for drivers going to the Belgian Limburg, Dutch Limburg, and Aachen, etc. Get train from Luxembourg city station to Arlon. Walk left out of station, keep following the Bastogne road signs towards a roundabout which is a 20 minute walk. Here you can hitchhikin at the junction after the bridge and across from the Fiat car garage. This road goes to Martelange and the North.\\n\\n=== East ([[Trier]], [[Germany]]) ===\\n====The better option====\\nJust walk out of the centre to the \\'\\'Avenue John Fitzgerald Kennedy\\'\\' in direction \\'\\'Kirchberg\\'\\'. You will find many banks, institutes and the Luxembourg fair (LuxExpo) there. You can hitch on every spot where cars can stop on this road and even in side roads and secondary roads which are leading to this avenue. Make sure holding a \\'\\'Trier\\'\\' sign. There are masses of people from \\'\\'Trier\\'\\' working in Luxembourg Kirchberg and especially on working days you won\\'t have to wait long. Hold a \\'\\'Trier\\'\\' sign even if you want to get further, if this is the case, you can be dropped at [[Wasserbillig]] service station on the motorway A1 (see The train option). A sign is very important for making the people from Trier stop, which will be your drivers here.\\n\\nTake the Bus 16 or tram to the stop just before the airport. This stop is next to an entrance to the highway and you can either stand in front of the bus stop with a sign or stand on a little traffic light island at the entrance so that you get all the traffic going towards Trier that is coming from both directions. Get a lift at least as far as the huge petrol station on the border, and then it is easier to hitch further.\\n\\n====The train option====\\n{{Coords|49.7265|6.4921}}<br>\\nGet the [[Trier]]/[[Wasserbillig]] (line 30) train from Luxembourg City station.

The problem is that lanes split quite early before getting onto motorway A2, the outer lane going to Bern or Zurich and the inner lane going southwards. It will be difficult for cars on the inner lane to pull out and pull in when the traffic is busy. It is better to follow the motorway direction, get to bus stop \\'\\'Wiggenhof on \\'\\'Grabenhofstrasse\\'\\' and hitch southwards from there. The Wiggenhof stop is only good for weekdays though - on weekends nobody is going towards Lugano from here and you might get stuck for hours.\\n\\n== Public Transport ==\\n\\nLucerne has a dense network of buses and trolley buses.

Waiting times tend to be long at all crossings. The [[Medyka-Shehyni border crossing]] is the only one open to pedestrians.\\n\\n=== Northwest towards [[Rava-Ruska]], [[Zamość]] (PL), [[Lublin]] (PL) {{E|372}} M09 ===\\nTake bus #45 from near the Shevchenko monument in the city center. Ask the driver to let you out at the stop for \\'\\'Avtostantsiya Nomer Dva\\'\\' \\'\\'\\'(АС-2 - Автостанція №2)\\'\\'\\', a bus station in the northern suburbs of Lviv. The driver will drop you off on a busy, wide road, where you just continue walking in the same direction for about 1 km until the beginning of road M-09 (E372) going to [[Rava-Ruska]] (Рава-Руська) and the border with [[Poland]]. This road is clearly signposted and once you turn off onto it, it\\'s easy to find room to stop a car.\\n\\nYou can also take a minibus from behind the Opera. There are a few lines going to AC-2 and some even further. If they turn left at the roundabout next to the big bus station stay, because then you don\\'t have to walk. Best is to take a bus going to \\'\\'Мурованое\\'\\', then you can stay until the very beginning of the road M09 (you can recognize it easily, because there is a bridge). It is also possible to take the busses 31, 51, 53 and some others to Rynok Galickij Perekrestok (\"рынок галицкий перекресток\") to arrive at the same spot. \\n\\nThis direction leads to the [[Hrebenne-Rava Ruska border crossing]].\\n\\n=== West towards [[Rzeszów]], [[Kraków]], [[Germany]] === \\n\\nIf you want to hitch towards Rzeszów and anywhere far away, you have at least two options. <br>\\nBoth the  [[Korczowa-Krakovets border crossing]] and the [[Medyka-Shehyni border crossing]] are frequented by people driving long distances towards Kraków, [[Wrocław]] or Germany. The majority is local traffic though. Taking the \\'\\'Medyka-Shehyni border crossing\\'\\' is probably the faster option, as you can cross on foot (\\'\\'not\\'\\' possible in Krakovets), which will save you the time needed to find a ride across the border, wait in the queue with them and undergo inspections of the car. Crossing on foot should be much faster.\\n\\nTo get to the \\'\\'Korczowa-Krakovets border crossing\\'\\', take bus #125 from the central train station to the last stop in Ryasny ruske (\\'\\'Рясне-Руське\\'\\'), walk a bit further until you\\'re directly behind the road crossing where cars and even trucks have a lot of space to stop. <br>\\nHere the ring road traffic passes by as well. In case you get a ride until or over the border you can patiently stay there to find a long ride. \\n\\nTo get to the \\'\\'Medyka-Shehyni border crossing\\'\\' from the central train station, you have two options. <br>\\nFirst lazy one is to take the minibus, see under [[#Public Transport|Public Transport]].\\nSecond option is to walk down the road from the train station, at the crossing walk to the right, pass the small local train station, follow the road for another 500m (along a gas station), and walk right again at the next crossing. There you\\'ll find a bus stop which is easy and fine to hitchhike rides out of town, which otherwise would be some 2 or 3 km of walking at least. Let you bring to the \"Metro\" shopping center thing, there you\\'ll find a huge roundabout which roads going all directions, including Shehyni. There\\'s also a very nice hitchhiking spot 100m further off the roundabout, with a restaurant next to it and satisfying light installations for night hitchhikers.\\n\\n=== Northeast toward [[Rivne]], [[Kyiv]] {{E|40}} M06 ===\\n\\nTake marshrutka (minibus) #8, #14, #36A or #39 from near the Shevchenko monument in the city center.

You can walk east along the main road for about 0.5 km and start hitching after the big billboard which stand over the road. There is free place for cars to stop, nd visibility is also very good.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Mukachevo]], [[Uzhgorod]], [[Ivano-Frankivsk]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Transylvania]] ([[Romania]]) {{E|50}} M9 ===\\n\\nTake a bus from the city centre to the shopping mall \\'\\'King\\'s Cross–Leopolis\\'\\'. (As of May 2014, this is bus number 10 and its starting point is the railway station) The mall is located just a few hundred metres north of the Lviv ring road. Walk south, cross the ring road, and hitch from alongside the first petrol station on your right; you can also ask drivers at the petrol station if you see a truck or car with a Czech or Slovak number plate. Only accept lifts that will take you as far as [[Striy]] (Стрий); writing [[Стрий]] might get you a lift quickly.\\n\\nThe town of Mukachevo is where to turn if you are going towards the northwestern part of Romania.\\n\\nAlso this direction is OK if you are going to [[Ivano-Frankivsk]]. In that case just reach Stryi and then hitchhike through [[Dolyna]] (Долина) and [[Kalush]] (Калуш) to Ivano-Frankivsk.\\n\\n=== Southeast towards [[Zvenyhorod]], [[Stare Selo]], [[Ivano-Frankivsk]] (H-09) ===\\n\\nTake  trolley №11 from ploshcha Petrushevycha to Kiltseva (Ring road). Start to hitchhike behind the Ring road. \\n(marshrutka (minibus) №160 does not go)\\n\\nBut because of bad quality of this road there are not many cars with far destination point. A lot of people going to Ivano-Frankivsk (Івано-Франківськ) by car use E50/M9 reaching Mykolayiv (Миколаїв) or Stryi (Стрий) and then turning directly to Ivano-Frankivsk. For more details see Southern direction.\\n\\n== Minibus to Polish border ==\\n\\nYou can get a marshrutka (minibus) from  Western Bus Station to the closest Polish border point, the [[Medyka-Shehyni border crossing]], which is not far from [[Przemyśl]] in Poland and it is allowed to cross on foot. This minibus costs around 80 UAH (no credit card, year 2020). Look or ask for one that says to \\'Shegyni\\' (Шегині).\\n\\n== Accommodation and Sleep ==\\nThere are some good places to pitch a tent in Lviv. \\n\\nIf you look for a calm and safe place you may choose Vynnyky forest or Bryukhovychi forest. To reach Vynnyky forest take bus №50 from the Puppet Theatre (Lyalkovyi Teatr) and go by it to vul. George Washington. Then go out and move a little bit back to vul. Pasichna. Turn right (to the south) and go around 500 metres along the street looking to the left for an entrance to the forest. Then just find a place you like. The forest is a popular place for picnics at weekends and holidays, but further from the main trails it\\'s not so typical to meet people and especially police. \\n\\nTo reach Bryukhovychi forest is more difficult as since some years there has been no public transport between Lviv and Bryukhovychi. Sure you can take a taxi or walk on feet but if that doesn\\'t fit you just use the Vynnyky forest option.\\n\\nIf you prefer a place close to the city center, there are few big parks in Lviv where it\\'s possible to pitch a tent, like Vysokyi Zamok, Shevchenkivskyi Hay (not the museum but its \"wild\" part known in Lviv as Kaiserwald) or Pohulyanka. Sure this options provide some risks but if you\\'ll find a relatively hidden place there\\'s not much probability someone will bother you.\\n\\n\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n__NOTOC__\\n\\n[[Category:Ukraine]]\\n[[Category:E40]]\\n\\n[[fr:Lviv]]\\n[[ru:Львов]]\\n[[uk:Львів]]',\n",

This is a good option because it puts you already north and out of Lyon, at a petrol station right along the motorway.  To get there take the metro to the stop \\'\\'Gare de Vaise\\'\\'.  From there catch the bus number 21 (Any bus with the number 21 will do, as this is the beginning of the route) and get off at the stop called \\'\\'Parc Sans Souci\\'\\'.  After you get off the bus continue walking in the direction the bus leaves (as if you were chasing it after you get off!)  After about 50 meters you will hit a street called \\'\\'Rue Sans Souci\\'\\' and turn left.  Continue walking following the road about 10 minutes, then turn right onto a road called \\'\\'Chemin de la Bruyere\\'\\'.  You should see the petrol station on the left after the Harley Davidson Warehouse/Store.  There is a fence but it\\'s usually open, otherwise jump it, it\\'s small. The petrol station is next to Metro store\\n\\nUpdate 2024: \\n- there is a door in the fence, usually open, truck drivers use it too\\n- many cars are stopping here, but you should not get there too late. In the night a lot of cars from the nearby villages mainly stop here\\n\\n=== South towards [[Orange]], [[Nîmes]], [[Marseille]], [[Saint-Étienne]] {{afr|6}} {{E|15}} ===\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\' Total petrol station\\n\\nTotal petrol station on A7, south of Lyon, on the level of a town called Vernaison, is a perfect place. To get there, you should take a train from Perrache station heading to Vernaison (€3.20, or just avoid the ticket inspector for 15 min). At Vernaison you cross the river (there are two bridges and an island between) once on the other site of the river follow the road left (north), walk until you reach the A7 highway and walk the down ramp next to the Energies Nouvelles sign. Welcome to \"Chemistry Valley\", one of the most polluted areas in France! You need to walk direction opposite to driving cars 1 km (don\\'t try to use the way behind the propertys).  The distance from Vernaison train station to the petrol station is around 3 km. \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'July 2023:\\'\\'\\' Walking alongside the highway is quite awkward and you better hope no cop car sees you, but the petrol station works. Otherwise you can simply hitch from the roundabout after the bridge, it works fine.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nTram T1 direction Debourg, and get off at the stop Musée des Confluences at a junction of the Pasteur bridge, where you have a small BP petrol station. There is a bus stop on the direction of road entering the highway - plenty of space for the cars to pull over. Since there\\'s a traffic lights, cars are not driving fast\\n\\n=== Getting onto [[A46 (France)|A46]] (Lyon Bypass) ===\\n\\nThere\\'s a big service area on the Lyon bypass (Contournement de Lyon) motorway. There are two petrol stations, one on each side of the road. This is located to the south of the urban area [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=1,+chemin+du+tram,+communay,+france&sll=45.594822,4.837589&sspn=0.048647,0.101967&ie=UTF8&z=15&ll=45.591849,4.826775&spn=0.012162,0.039568&t=k&om=1 map]. Directions are: \\n\\nAire de Service de Communay Sud rest stop direction south - A7 – Marseille, [[Montpellier]] or A47 – Saint Etienne<br/>\\nAires de Service de Communay Nord rest stop direction north - A6 – [[Dijon]], [[Paris]] or A42 – [[Geneva|Genève]]\\n\\nThere\\'s one bus going to Communay, the closest village, the bus #179 From Rond point Darilly (Métro Parilly), but it goes 7 times a day on workdays and 4 times the day on week-ends. there\\'s several stops in the village. You can check out the timetable [http://www.rhone.fr/file/idocumentsattaches/transport/lr_ligne_179.pdf here]. \\nIf you missed it there\\'s a bus 39 from metro Venissieux, but goes only until Solaize, 5 km closer to the center on road D307/N7, leading to the motorway. The station is about 1 km south from the interchange. The service-stations are sealed off from the normal road but at least for the northbound spot, you can easily climb over the fence. Finding a hitch here is very easy. If you know how to get here, it is definitely worth the hustle.\\n\\nMarché de Gros is situated in the very south of the Saone peninsula. Coming from Rue Casimir Périer You reach a street alongside A7 with lots of cars going to the the motorway. Vasy there, a lot of stop-and-go.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Chambéry]], [[Grenoble]], [[Geneva]] {{afr|43}} {{E|70}} ===\\n\\n==== Motorway services Aire de Service de Saint-Priest ====\\n\\nTake tram T2 from where it starts at metro/train station Perrache to the last stop at St. Priest - Bel Air. Continue to walk in the direction of the tram 100m to the roundabout. Turn left along Rue Pierre Mendes France for 500m until you reach the roundabout at Rue du Grisard. Turn right along Rue du Grisard (which becomes Rue Jules Verne) for 1km and then turn right into Chemin de Mauguette. You will already see the motorway and petrol station in the distance. Continue walking along Chemin de Mauguette for about 400m until you get to a gated vehicle entrance to the petrol station on your left. Although the gate may be locked, there is a gap between it and the main fence, allowing people to pass through easily. This is a good place to ask for a lift to Chambery or Geneve. There aren\\'t many people though and a lot aren\\'t going this way, you therefore may end up waiting a lot.\\n\\nYou can choose to ride a train until Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, very good option, a little walk to the toll (20 to 25mins) and you\\'re on. The best place, but beware of the workers on the toll, they will maybe try to chase you away. Ignore them and go further into the next toll platform.\\n\\nYou can also hitchhike closer to Lyon. There is an [[on-ramp]] in Lyon where you can hitch straight onto the motorway to A43/E70. Take the metro Line D to Mermoz-Pinel. You will find a bus lane on the avenue Jean Mermoz, where the highway starts. It is easy to get a lift there with a sign. Don\\'t forget to ask the person who takes you if they are going to the highway, because they could also take the national road.\\n\\n=== Northeast toward Bourg en Bresse, [[Dijon]], [[Geneva]] {{afr|42}} {{E|611}} ===\\n\\n==== Motorway services Aire de Dagneux   ====\\n\\nMedium sized rest area on the highway with petrol station and restaurant. Lots of traffic going towards Geneva; also, vehicles with Dutch and Germans number plates going via Dijon. Halfway before the road splits in direction Geneva and Dijon (after about 30km) there is a parking area and after the split, another petrol station at Ceignes.\\n\\nTake bus 171 from Hotel De Ville next to the river in Lyon and get off at Montluel train station (penultimate stop). Head east about 1km along Ave Des Platanes and Blvd Robert Schuman. Turn right at the intersection onto Rue Des Chartinières. Head south about 1km crossing under the railway tracks and the bridge over the motorway. Take the first turn left after the bridge and follow the road close to the motorway. There is a small space to enter the petrol station, only for pedestrians, behind the little house at the end of the parking lot.The bus trip takes about 45 mins (2 euros one way) with another 20 mins walking. It goes through some small French villages and along the way lots of big supermarkets in case you need food.\\n\\n=== West towards [[Clermont-Ferrand]], [[Bordeaux]] {{afr|89}} ===\\n\\'\\'\\'Warning\\'\\'\\': the [[A89 (France)|A89]] runs directly from Lyon to Bordeaux via Clermont-Ferrand. Most hitchhiker websites still advise you to head south towards St. Etienne over the A47 first, but this new route is much more efficient.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nFirst take the metro D (\"Gare de Vaise\" direction) and get out at \"Gorge de Loup\" station.\\nThen take the bus [http://www.tcl.fr/content/download/525592/4081129/version/8/file/FH+86_Hiver.pdf 86] (checked 2014) to \"La Tour de Salvagny\" (The metro ticket is still available for this trip). Get out of the bus at \"La Tour de Salvagny\" bus stop (20 minutes ride). Then take the first road on your right called \"Avenue des Monts d\\'Or\".\\nWalk straight 500m to a bridge. In front of the bridge, turn right and walk down to the roundabout. There is a nice place for cars to stop just after the roundabout in the direction of Clermont-Ferrand. \\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nOr go to Gare de Vaise and ride Bus 6 (not C6, just 6) to Techlid and stop at \"Les Ormeaux\", 10m further there\\'s an entrance to the back of the gas station of \"Aire de Bruyere\". You can ask people to go to A89 (towards Clermont Ferrant) or A6 (towards north). The first car I asked took me all the way to Clermont Ferrant.\\n\\nIndicate that you would like to go to the \"péage\" (Highway toll gate). Almost 50% of the people passing through the péage are going straight to Clermont-Ferrand. So have a good ride!\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n{{Cities France}}\\n\\n{{IsIn|Rhône-Alpes}}\\n{{Hitchhiking Zine nomination}}\\n\\n[[Category:Rhône-Alpes]]\\n\\n[[Category:France]]\\n[[Category:E15]]\\n[[Category:E70]]\\n\\n[[de:Lyon]]\\n[[es:Lyon]]\\n[[fr:Lyon]]',\n",

At this bus stop you'll find a petrol station. There you can try to get a lift towards [[Aachen]] in [[Germany]].  You might have to get a few lifts, village to village, along the {{Nnl|278}} aka ''Cadier en Keer'', but you shouldn't ever have to wait very long. Usually a lift to at least [[Vaals]], which is right before the border and Aachen, is possible. Towards Aachen it may be quicker to go via Heerlen.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Liège|Liege]] (A2) {{E|25}} ===\\n{{Coords|50.8410|5.7161}}<br>\\nFollow the rail track from the central station out of the town in a southern direction from the backside exit (use the bridge over the rails). At the first rail/road crossing south of the station hike on over the cycling path and later, still by the side of the railway, over ''Sint Gerardusweg''. Follow this way until the end, thus you walk under a bridge (''John F. Kennedysingel''). This is the junction ''Europaplein''. Keep walking 100 meters ahead to the motorway ramp. Average wait is about 10 minutes, max. 30 minutes. Longer rides are not common. Petrol station between Maastricht and Liège (still in the Netherlands) is not very busy, but can give longer rides into France.

The best place to hitch from is probably on the shoulder of the 151 just after I94/90/39 intersects it. Be prepared to wait a while.\\n\\n=== North/West towards [[La Crosse]], [[Minneapolis]], Hwy 90 ===\\nOn East Washington Ave and East Springs Dr, there\\'s a Shell station and several fast food restaurants where cars can turn on their way to the highway (or you can directly ask people). They\\'re going a bit fast but they have two opportunities to turn and can decide while at the stoplight as long as they can see you. There\\'s an entrance to go to Chicago as well so a sign might be useful. After getting stuck in the evening [[User:Matt&camy|Matt&camy]] got a ride after about 40 minutes the next day. In case you get stuck, you can go down E Springs Dr until you find a bowling alley next to a small grass area where you could pitch a tent although it\\'s not the best.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Chicago]] ===\\nSame spot as above to go North/West, E Washington and East Springs Dr.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Milwaukee]] ===\\nThe 30 East ramp entering I94/90/39 from US 151 eastbound (E Washington St.) is a great place to catch a ride. To get here from downtown, you can take an 06 northeast bus towards East Towne Mall. \\n\\n[[Category:Wisconsin]]\\n{{IsIn|Wisconsin}}\\n__NOTOC__',\n",

It is geographically located in the centre of the Iberian peninsular, and thus has road connections to all directions in Spain and also Portugal.\\n\\n== Hitching out ==\\n=== South toward [[Cordoba|Córdoba]], [[Granada|Granada]], [[Algeciras]] {{E|5}} ===\\n====Option 1====\\nThere is a bus stop just outside the metro station San Cristobal (on line 3, or the \"yellow\" line) that is good to hitch from (make sure you\\'re on the correct side of the road). There is nowhere else to pull over for several kilometers back toward the city. This same road (Av. de Andalucia) leads South, toward the entrance to the Autovía del Sur highway, which goes to Córdoba and Algeciras. Not far from the entrance to the autovía (maybe only about 5 or 10 km down) is another petrol station. So, you don´t even need to find a ride that is going very far from this point, because you can simply ask to be dropped at the next petrol station on the Autovía del Sur.\\n\\n====Option 2====\\nThere is a small service station Estación de Servicio Repsol with a McDonalds in Pinto. Take the train C3 from Sol (or other stations from Central Madrid), should cost nearly 3 euros. Then get off at Pinto. Walk eastwards through several streets towards the motorway, via Avenida Isabel La Catolica. It\\'s around 1.5 km. Once in the service station, ask people. Apparently, there are a lot of people going through towards Morocco, so you might get a long distance hitch towards south (although sometimes cars are packed). It might be better than alternative 2 which has little/local traffic\\n\\n====Option 3====\\nAnother option is taking the train  C3, which leaves from Sol, to the Station Valdemor. The ticket should cost 3,30 € and it takes 30 minutes to get toValdemor. Get off the train and walk downPaseo de la Estacio, take a slight left onto Calle República Argentina(the road right next to the highway) take a right to followCalle República Argentin. After 100 meter turn left onto Av de Andalucia and follow it until you get to the Cedipsa Compañía Española Distribuidora de Petróleos S.A.\\npetrol station. In total it is a 30 minute walk (going uphill). The petrol station is right next to the highway. There is also a big truck stop. The station has mostly local people (as it has a car wash) and is usually quite empty, but you will find somebody (going to Ocana) who will take you to the next service station. \\n\\nIn any case, try to get to the Sesana service station, it\\'s on the motorway 4, between Valdemoro and Ocana. Although it is small, it has a restaurant, and unlike other service stations in the South of Madrid, you will find long distance rides there (Granada, Cordoba) with some patience.\\n\\n\\n=== East toward [[Valencia]], [[Murcia]] {{E|901}} ===\\nTake the metro 9 in the direction Arganda Del Rey (it costs 1 euro for regular zone ticket + 1 euro for extra zone, you have to buy 2 different tickets) and get off at the stop Rivas Vaciamadrid.\\n\\nGo out of the station, on the right pass under the bridge to the roundabout. You\\'ll see some steps that lead to a bridge over the motorway, on the left there is a petrol station + an motorway onramp. Combine using a sign with asking people and be patient. \\n\\n\\n=== Northeast towards [[Zaragoza]], [[Barcelona]] {{E|90}} ===\\nHitchhiking between Madrid and Barcelona is fairly easy, but there are multiple options\\n\\n====Option 1====\\nTake the Renfe train number C7 direction Alcala de Hernares or C2 direction Guadalajara from Atoche. Get out on the station named La Garena. When you get out of the station, go right to Av Juan Carlos 1. It later continues in Av De Europa. Then follow the signs saying A2 Zaragoza, and find the Galp petrol station. You can access it from the industrial area right behind it. \\n\\nFrom here you can find a ride to the Cepsa petrol station a little further at km 40, where there are better chances of longer rides. \\n\\n====Option 2====\\nThe San Fernando hitch point. Take the train from Atocha in the direction Alcala de Henares or Guadalajara until the station San Fernando near Madrid. The train ticket will cost 1.45 euro. Behind the San Fernando train station there is an entrance to the motorway where you can easily hitchhike.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Burgos]], Basque Country, [[Bordeaux]] {{European Route Number|5}} ===\\n====Option 1====\\nTake the metro to the station Pinar de Chamartín (1 euro). Walk on the street Calle Arturo Soria, cross the M-11, follow the street Camino de la Fuente de la Mora, then turn left at the Avenida de Manoteras. You can stay directly in front of the train station. There is a traffic light and the cars can stop there, more or less. There is a Cepsa petrol station on the left 300 meters further\\n\\nOnce out of Madrid, safest idea is to request lifts to the various service stations, and simply approach people who drive in and politely ask them for a lift.\\n\\n====Option 2====\\nTake the metro to Hospital Infanta Sofia on line 1. From this metro station you can walk ten minutes up the road to a Shell petrol station on the side of the E5 heading north. From the metro station follow the road Paseo De Europa for 800m.\\n\\n=== Northwest towards Galicia ===\\nTake metro line 3 to Moncloa. On one of the underground levels of the metro/bus station, take bus number 162 to stop \\'Av. Padre Huidobro - Argentona\\', located on route A6 in the direction of La Coruña. You\\'ll pass a Estación de Servicio Repsol - when you get off the bus, walk back down the road about 1.4km to reach it. There is a pavement followed by a foot-trail, so you don\\'t have to walk on the road. Not a big garage but there\\'s a steady trickle of drivers. \\n\\n=== West towards [[Portugal]] {{European Route Number|90}} ===\\n====Option 1====\\nTake metro line 6 to Alto de Extremadura and then go to the Cepsa service station on Avenida de Portugal 16, which is the A5 highway. Most traffic is still staying in the city, be patient and persistant. From here you can look for a lift to the petrol stations mentioned in Option 2 (very close by) or Option 3, or, even better, to the one at km 48 down the A5 (right before Las ventas de Retamosa, exit 49 ). Apparently if you walk 5 minutes down the road on the left there is a place that serves free food at 12.00 pm. \\n\\n====Option 2====\\nTake metro 10 or 5 to till Casa de Campo and walk to Repsol Batan gas station, on Carretera Extremadura (A5 highway). Same chances as in Option 1, with most traffic still staying around Madrid.\\n\\n====Option 3====\\nTake a metro to Hospital de Móstoles (line 12) and walk about 1 km through end-of-suburbia fields to Autovía del Suroeste next to A5 highway. There is a good Estación de Servicio Repsol petrol station with a Burger King  close to Móstoles. You\\'ll enter through the petrol station direction Madrid, and take the bridge to the other side of the highway, direction Talavera, Merida, Badajoz, Portugal.\\n\\n====Option 4====\\nGet to the service station Repsol R-5. You would have simply take the metro line 1O to Puerto Del Sur, about 30 minutes riding away from the city centre, and then walk a kilometre or so down Av Leganés passing McDonalds, splitting off to the petrol station as you can [https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=40.337075,-3.802514&hl=en&ll=40.339127,-3.799456&spn=0.004923,0.009645&sll=40.337009,-3.802621&sspn=0.009846,0.01929&mra=mift&mrsp=0&sz=16&t=h&z=17 see here]\\n\\n\\n== Public transport ==\\n\\nMadrid has a very extensive well - connected metro system that can help you get in and out of the city; a single metro journey is 2 Euros, and a ride on the cercanías should be between 2.50 and 4 euros. If the guard is not watching, or if the metro station has two entrances, you can usually jump the turnstiles. Once inside, there are few controls. The cercanías, however, have barriers at the entry AND the exit. \\n\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|Spain}}\\n\\n[[Category:Spain]]\\n[[Category:E5]]\\n[[Category:E90]]\\n[[Category:E901]]\\n[[Category:City\\'s]]\\n[[fr:Madrid]]\\n[[ru:Мадрид]]',\n",

It is enclosed by the a [[A2 (Germany)|A2]] in the north and the [[A14 (Germany)|A14]] in the South and West which intersect in the North-West of the city. The B71 is running through the middle of the city intersecting with the A2 in the North and the A14 in the South. Due to the B71 there are many different on-ramps and spots all over the city, although their hitchability may vary. \\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n=== East towards [[Berlin]] ===\\n\\n==== Option 1: Autohof Magdeburg ====\\n\\nTake Tram 10 towards \"Barleber See\" and get out at the last station \"Barleber See\". Walk right, cross the August-Bebel-Damm and walk further straight into Glindenberger Weg. You will already see Mc Donald\\'s and Aral petrol station signs. It is a two minutes walk. At the petrol station is not so much traffic, but many people going further to Berlin stop at McD\\'s. Place yourself in front of the entrance. This place just opened 2012 and is now the best place for almost no waiting times, but it takes a bit longer to get there by tram. \\n\\n==== Option 2: The petrol station at B71 ====\\n\\nTake Tram 9 in Magdeburg towards \\'\\'Neustädter See\\'\\' and get out at \\'\\'Krähenstieg\\'\\'. Walk left, crossing the tracks and the street. Turn right after the tower-like building and walk down the street there. After some meters you will recognize the petrol station behind some trees on the left side. It is directly located along the \\'\\'B71\\'\\' which intersects with the A2 at \\'\\'Magdeburg-Centrum\\'\\'.\\n\\nIn the afternoon you meet a lot of people who just go to their home villages in the counties Jerichower Land (number plate JL), Ohrekreis (OK) or [[Salzwedel]] (SAW) but there are also cars going longer distances.\\n\\nSince there are often more cars towards the West you could take any ride that goes past the service station \\'\\'Börde\\'\\' on the A2, get off there and cross over to the other side (there is a bridge) and hitch from there.\\n\\n==== Option 3: B71 on-ramp at the university ====\\nVery easy to get to is the on-ramp of the B71 close to the university. Take a tram to \\'\\'Universität\\'\\' and from the roundabout follow the \\'\\'Walter-Rathenau-Straße\\'\\' for a few hundred meters. There is a bus stop with a huge shoulder before the bridge. \\n\\nAlternatively continue until the very on-ramp. Traffic lights and cars from the other direction as well. Directly at the on-ramp it is difficult to stop, but still possible to hitch a ride. Especially on Fridays many students are leaving the city this way. Sign very advisable.\\n\\n<!---\\n==== Option 4: Service Station Börde at the A2 ====\\n<map lat=\\'52.1832\\' lng=\\'11.44\\' zoom=\\'13\\' view=\\'2\\' float=\\'right\\' width=\\'250\\' height=\\'200\\'/>\\nAnother option is the service station \\'\\'[[Börde Nord]]\\'\\' and \\'\\'[[Börde Süd]]\\'\\', a pretty nice starting point for hitchhikers. However, it includes a longer bus ride starting at the central bus station \\'\\'Damaschkeplatz\\'\\' behind \\'\\'Hauptbahnhof\\'\\'. \\n\\nYou can take bus number 615 towards \\'\\'Eichenbarleben\\'\\' and get out at bus stop \\'\\'Mammendorf (Eichenbarleben)\\'\\'. From here you can walk to the service station. You\\'ll approach the service station from the south and need to take the path to the right before the underpass of the motorway. -->\\n\\nYou can also take bus number 618 towards \\'\\'Rottmersleben\\'\\' until \\'\\'Groß Santersleben\\'\\'. Form here you need to take the Mammendorfer Weg (direction southwest). You will first see the service station Börde Nord (westbound) and after you passed under the motorway you will find the path going to the left to Börde Süd ((south-)eastbound).\\n\\n=== South-East towards [[Dessau]] ===\\nTake tram #5 or #6 to \\'\\'Jerichower Platz\\'\\' and look for the bus stop next to the petrol station. Take bus #51 to the stop \\'\\'Biederitzer Str. / Heyrothsberge\\'\\'. Walk back to the main road, then turn left and hitch from the street turning right at the next traffic light along \\'\\'Königsberger Str.\\'\\'.\\n\\nYou could also ask at the petrol station next to the bus stop if you don\\'t want to wait for the bus or walk along \\'\\'Jerichower Straße\\'\\'/\\'\\'Berliner Chausse\\'\\' for about 1.5km until you reach a traffic light shortly after which is a good spot to pull over. \\n\\n=== West towards [[Hannover]], [[Hamburg]] ===\\n==== Option 1: AGIP petrol station at the B1 ====\\nTake tram #3, #4 or #5 to \\'\\'Albert-Vater-Str.\\'\\'. You will see an AGIP petrol station on your right. It is good for westbound traffic on the A2. You can hitch at the petrol station or by the road (eg. at the bus station). Cars which are not going onto the highway could drop you in Irxleben, from there it is really close to the Rasthof at the exit #67 Irxleben which is a good place to hitch as well.\\n\\n==== Option 2: The petrol station at the B71 ====\\nSame as for Berlin. Local cars going to or further than the exit #67 Irxleben can take you to the the Rasthof at the exit or to the service station Börde respectively. It is usually easier to get a lift towards the West than to Berlin. \\n\\n==== Option 3: B71 on-ramp at the university ====\\nSame as for Berlin. Take a different sign though: \\'\\'A2 West\\'\\' works quite well for example. \\n\\n=== South-East to [[Halle]], [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] and South-West ===\\n==== Option 1: B71 on-ramp Südring ====\\nTake the tram #1, #5 or #10 to the stop \\'\\'Südring\\'\\'. You will see an on-ramp next to the cross roads. From there you can easily get lifts towards Halle or Leipzig by using a sign. If you go further you can get off at the service station Plötzetal West on the [[A14_(Germany)|A14]] before Halle. This is probably the easiest to reach spot. \\n\\n==== Option 2: B71 on-ramp at the university ====\\nLike to Berlin or Hannover. Either at the bus stop or at the on-ramp. The on-ramp in this direction offers a little better place to stop. Sign advisable. \\n\\n==== Option 3: Shell petrol station ====\\nTake tram #9 or #3 until the last stop \\'Bördepark Ost\\'\\'. Now you can take the bus #54 in direction of \\'\\'Porsestraße\\'\\' and get off at the bus stop \\'\\'Schreberstraße\\'\\' (or just walk West towards the B71 and continue straight, it is about 1.5km). Turn left at the big supermarket, walk straight for a few hundred meters and you will see the Shell petrol station. Is directly accessible from the B71 to the South, but also some local traffic might stop here.\\n\\n== Hitching In ==\\nAs the [[A2 (Germany)|A2]] and the [[A14 (Germany)|A14]] cross in the northwest of Magdeburg how to get off depends of which direction you driver is coming and where he will go on.\\n\\n=== [[A2 (Germany)|A2]] from West or East ===\\n\\n==== Exit \\'\\'Rothensee\\'\\' (#71 on A2) ====\\nIf you find a driver who is passing Magdeburg on the A2 but not willing to bring you into the city, you can ask hir<!--this is a gender neutral pronoun--> to drop you off at the exit \\'\\'Magdeburg Rothensee\\'\\' because the tram stop \\'\\'Barleber See\\'\\' is directly next to it. \\n\\nThe last trains (Tram 10 at daytime, Tram 94 at night) run at 23:15 and the first after 5:00. However, if you miss the last one, you can also walk 3 km to the stop \\'\\'Hohenwarther Straße\\'\\' – just follow the big road. There, Tram 94 can pick you up nearly every hour at night. Otherwise, the industrial area is quiet at night and you can try to sleep in the grass or bushes. One tramp stop further is an Aral petrol station and a traffic light at the crossroads. During the night, you can easily fetch cars coming from the highway by pressing the traffic light button for pedestrians - for cars, the traffic light almost immediately turns red. Just wait until you see the headlights of an arriving car and press the button to guarantee it has to stop, then ask. \\n\\n==== Intersection \\'\\'Magdeburg-Zentrum\\'\\' (#70 on A2) ====\\nIf your driver does not mind making a small detour (about 2km in total) he can turn at the intersection \\'\\'Magdeburg-Zentrum\\'\\' onto the B71 towards Magdeburg. After about 800m there is another exit, take that one, your driver should turn left at the traffic light. At the next traffic light your driver turns left to get back to the highway and you get off and turn right and walk about 1km to the tram stop \\'\\'Krähenstieg\\'\\'. From here trams run more frequently and you are faster in the city centre, especially at night. \\n\\n=== [[A14 (Germany)|A14]] from South or North ===\\n\\n==== Exit \\'\\'Magdeburg-Stadtfeld\\'\\' (#3 on A14) ====\\nIf your driver is going to continue along the A14 instead of the A2, he can drop you also at the exit #3 \\'\\'MD-Stadtfeld\\'\\'. It is the first exit after the intersection. It is a national road and cars drive fast, but there is a traffic light which leaves you a small time margin to catch a ride when the light turns red. The advantage of this spot is that it is closest to the city center and the next tram stop is only 3km away. \\n\\n==== Exit \\'\\'Magdeburg-Reform\\'\\' (#6 on A14) ====\\n\\nAt the A14 your best bet is to get dropped off at exit #6 \\'\\'MD-Reform\\'\\' and walk until the bus station to get a further ride. Waiting times vary from short to very long and depend a lot of the amount of cars passing by, especially on weekends.\\n\\n\\n== Public transport ==\\n\\nLocal buses and trams are run by the MVB. Their [http://www.mvbnet.de website] is only available in German.\\n\\nAnyone with an adult monthly ticket or job ticket can take you for free on weekdays between 19:00 and 4:00 as well as on weekends and public holidays at any times. Ask around at the stations. Unfortunately, students cannot take you.\\n\\nYou can get on buses and trams without paying beforehand. The ticket inspectors wear uniforms (dark vests in summer) and they try to hide themselves before entering a train. They could wear civil clothes as well. During the day you could pretend to be about to buy a ticket standing next to the ticket machines. However, especially on weekends at night time there are many controls by though and evil looking guys in black clothing who probably won\\'t fall for this trick. \\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n{{excellent}}\\n[[Category:Saxony-Anhalt]]\\n[[Category:E30]]\\n[[Category:E49]]\\n[[Category:Route Amsterdam - Berlin]]\\n\\n[[de:Magdeburg]]',\n",

You can see what Maidstone Services looks like on Google Streetview.\\n\\n[http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?ie=UTF8&q=Maidstone+Services&fb=1&gl=uk&hq=Maidstone+Services&hnear=Maidstone+Services&cid=0,0,2266471664562615665&ei=swErTNLIKpH60wS_nozfAg&ved=0CCoQnwIwAw&layer=c&cbll=51.266932,0.614472&panoid=id3kCROZvLd_DnG1e1nWTA&ll=51.267017,0.614483&spn=0,0.015235&z=16&cbp=12,341.57,,0,18.56 Maidstone Services on Google Streetview]\\n\\nIt is the only Services along the M20 between [[Dover]] and the M25 Ring surrounding Greater [[London]]. It is located at Exit 8 (which is huge roundabout) on the Northern side of the motorway. Many European cars (and some truckers, but there is not a lot of space for trucker, which would rather stops at the \\'trucker Services in Ashford\\') stops at this Services which offers Restaurants area and Gasoline. The negative side is that it welcomes traffic going both ways (towards as well as from [[London]]). You simply need to ask around or show a sign just in case.\\n\\nYou can therefore catch a ride going into [[Channel Tunnel|The Channel Tunnel]] which is 20 miles South or all the way to [[Dover]] crossing with the ferry.\\n\\nWhen [[User:Frida|Frida]] and a friend were at Maidstone, it seemed more people going towards the Channel than going towards London were stopping there to get some food in the restaurant. If you are looking for a lift across the water, go in front of the restaurant and don\\'t be shy to ask people for a lift.\\n\\nAsking might be better than holding a sign because you\\'ll be able to explain your situation and gain the driver\\'s trust (since you\\'ll need them to be willing to a. add you to their ticket free of charge b. not to say that you\\'re hitchhiking, though this seems to be more important when entering the UK rather than leaving it). \\n\\n\\n=== Arriving by Train ===\\n[[File:Hollingbourne.png|200px|thumb|right|A map to the service station.]] \\n\\nHitchhiking out of London can take a long time, so if you\\'d rather sleep in and waste some money you can get the train to Hollingbourne. I, [[User:Mooseling|Mooseling]], just tried this and found it very easy. From London, the train goes past Maidstone Services just about a minute before reaching Hollingbourne station, so you basically want to go into the farm fields and follow the tracks back to the service station. Get out of the train, walk back along the platform and down next to the tracks. Just ignore the sign that prohibits this, but make sure nobody\\'s watching. After about twenty meters there are gates in the fences next to the tracks, go through the one on the left and into the fields. Stay in the fields and keep following the tracks back away from the station. You\\'ll need to cross a little stream and a couple fences, and after three fields you\\'ll enter a little woodland. This surrounds the service station, just walk straight through it and you\\'ll be there. I did it in the spring and it was very nice. I was tempted to stop and fly a kite.\\n\\nUpdate 2022: If you don\\'t want to \"sneak down the platform\", exit the train station on the side where there is a small building and a car park. Take the footpath infront of you that goes up a bit. After about 10 meters you come to two gates/stiles close after each other. Go through the first one, but instead of going through the second turn right into the field. When you come to the small stream you can walk along it for about 20 meters till you come to a metal gate and a crossing over the water. Keep to the right side while crossing the fields. You will have to climb two fences and the fences on the right are already a bit worn down by people who climbed them. The gates and fences are quite easy to climb. They are designed to keep cattles in and don\\'t try very hard to keep humans out.\\n\\n\\n\\n== Ashford Services ==\\n\\nAs of 2012 this is not a good place to hitchhike for various reasons - better stick to Maidstone. If anything changes, let us know!\\n\\n\\'\\'A possible sneaky and cunning way to get to Dover\\'\\' - Exit Ashford Services and turn right on the roundabout, walk down the road for one minute and then turn left down \\'\\'\\'Ashford Road\\'\\'\\'. Continue to walk along Ashford Road for about ten minutes until you reach \\'\\'\\'Sandling Road\\'\\'\\' which will take you all the way down to a reasonable remote train station! This train station contains a pay-on-the-train system where you pay a little bit of your fare (we paid 20p) and the machine gives you your ticket and expects you to pay the rest when the conductor sees you - which he did not!! 1p fare from Ashford to Dover anyone!?\\n\\n== Links ==\\n\\n* [http://motorwayservicesonline.co.uk/services/maidstone/ Maidstone services - Motorway Services Online]\\n\\n[[Category:England]]',\n",

It is well known in [[Germany]] for its famous carnival.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n=== South ([[Kaiserslautern]], [[Saarbrücken]], [[Metz]]) [[A63 (Germany)|A63]] ===\\nIf you want to go in the direction of [[Kaiserslautern]] (or farther south) a good place to start is the \"Pariser Tor[http://hitchwiki.org/maps/?place=5091]\" on the \"Pariser Straße\". The speed limit there is 50 km/h and the cars will have enough place to to stop.  \\nNext petrol stain direction of Saarbrücken is \"Homburg\" on A6, ~20km after Kaiserslautern.\\n\\n=== Direction [[Darmstadt]], [[Mannheim]], [[Heidelberg]] onto [[A60]] to [[A67]] & [[A5]] ===\\nTake the tram 50, 51, 52 from \"Mainz Hauptbahnhof\" to \"Pariser Tor\" or \"Mainz-Hechtsheim, Kurmainz Kaserne\". According to the hitchwiki-map there should be a spot at \"Pariser Tor\". If you get out at \"Kurmainz Kaserne\" you can already see the motorway. Walk about 5 minutes along the main street. Directly before the drive-up there is a traffic light and a traffic island where you can stand and ask drivers to bring you to the A67 (close to Darmstadt there is a service station). To get on this traffic island you have to cross four lanes. \\n\\n\\'\\'[[User: Frixge|Frixge]] was there on Sunday afternoon and there was nearly no traffic. During the week it might be hard and dangerous to cross.\\'\\'\\n\\n=== Direction [[Berlin]] ===\\nTake bus 28 or 67 to \\'\\'\\'am Fort Biehler\\'\\'\\'. There is a petrol station on the national road, not to far from the motorway.\\n\\n=== Direction [[Frankfurt]] [[A66 (Germany)|A66]] ===\\nTake the bus 6a to the stop called Freizeitbad in [[Wiesbaden]].  From there, walk back towards the overpass, going under it and following the \"motorway\" (It\\'s more just a big road) staying to the right.  You will see a sign showing the entrance ramp towards Frankfurt as being at the 2nd light.  Walk another 15 or 20 minutes and there you are.  There is a good place for cars to pull over. I got a ride to Frankfurt from the first car that passed!(August 7th 2009) \\n\\n=== West ([[Bingen]], [[Koblenz]], [[Bad Kreuznach]], [[Hahn Airport]]) [[A60 (Germany)|A60]] [[A60 (Germany)|A61]] ===\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\'\\nThe bus station \\'\\'Friedrich-von-Pfeiffer-Weg\\'\\' (right at the university) is a good hitchhiking spot on the motorway feeder. Take one of the bus lines 54, 55, 58, 68, 69 to get here. A sign might be very helpful, as cars are going fast here.\\n\\nOn the A60, there is a service area only 10 km away, just before the motorway branches. It\\'s not very busy, but still good for getting long lifts.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\'\\nYou could also try to get a lift at the \"Pariser Tor[http://hitchwiki.org/maps/?place=5091]\" as some cars will go on the A60 from there.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3\\'\\'\\' towards [[Köln]]([[A3]]) try hitchhiking from Kastel, Boelckestraße out. There is a bus stop Otto-Suhr-Ring, and a big Metro-Supermarket (wich might be good for dumpster diving). Next petrol station on A3 should be Medenbach Ost (~20km).\\n\\n=== Direction [[Köln]]([[A3]]), [[Karlsruhe]]([[A5]]) ===\\nYou can take the train to Frankfurt Airport (ticket should be around 4.50€). Next to the regional train station there are machines where drivers pay for their parking so you can ask them for a lift. Should be easy in direction Köln or Karlsruhe, but harder North along A5 or south along A3. You can read more about the airport [[Frankfurt_am_Main|here]].\\n\\n== Hitchhiking in ==\\n\\nSince most motorways go around Mainz you might have problems finding a driver going into the city. It might be easier to go to a nearby city like Wiesbaden, Frankfurt or Darmstadt and take the regional train from there. A train from Frankfurt should be around 5€.\\nIf you come from A3 you can consider getting out at Frankfurt Airport for the train. From Koblenz along A60 you could get out after junction 16 at the resting area, there is a train in Heidesheim.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n{{hitchbase_city|100}}\\n\\n__NOTOC__\\n\\n[[Category:Rhineland-Palatinate]]\\n\\n[[de:Mainz]]',\n",

For hitchhiking purposes, these two town have been combined in one article, as they form one united municipal area. It\\'s possible to hitchhike inside the city, as well, e.g. along Blv. Artigas from/to Punta del Este to/from Maldonado. Be aware of the many motorbike drivers, who often do not take care of the ongoing traffic. Especially when stopping a car, be sure there\\'s sufficient space and visibility for motorbikes to pass and not crash into the stopping vehicle.\\n\\n==Hitching out==\\n\\n===West towards [[Piriapolis]], [[Atlántida]], [[Montevideo]] (IB)===\\n\\nOption 1: There\\'s a not very safe hitchhiking spot at the corner of Ruta 10 (Mansa) and Avenida España (see Hitchwiki Map), locally referred to as \\'\\'Parada 25\\'\\'. Traffic is slow due to the traffic light, and there\\'s a bus stop behind. Nevertheless, there\\'s no space for cars to pull over, so they have to stop on the side of the road while traffic rushes on from behind. During summer, traffic is heavy, outside of the season, this spot is pretty neat. Also, it has a beautiful beach (and view) right next to it. If this spot is not good enough, take at least a ride 3-4km up the road until you find yourself at Option 3.\\n\\nOption 2: Anywhere along the Rambla (Mansa), it is possible to hitchhike and hike while walking out of town. There might be a lot of local traffic, though out of half a dozen times, average waiting time for was about 10 minutes near Parada 7 to get a vehicle out of town at least until Parada 25 (Option 1) or Punta Ballena (Option 3).\\n\\nOption 3: Take a local bus (or hitch) along the Ruta 10 to Punta Ballena and get out just behind Punta Ballena at the roundabout at \\'\\'Solanas\\'\\' (Portezuelo). There\\'s a ANCAP service station located, which has a great spot for hitchhiking. It\\'s recommend to neglect local traffic and wait for a straight ride to Montevideo, if this is your destination. There\\'ll be plenty of it.\\n\\n===East towards [[La Barra]], Jose Ignacio (Ruta 10)===\\n\\nIt\\'s pretty easy to hitchhike along the Ruta 10 (Brava). Best is to walk from peninsula until about \\'\\'Parada 5\\'\\' or \\'\\'Parada 6\\'\\' close to the crossing with Av. Roosevelt where there\\'s more space to stop cars and no more traffic towards Maldonado.\\n\\n===North towards [[San Carlos]]===\\n\\nDepending on where you start, there\\'s two options:\\nOption 1: From Punta del Este, get yourself to the Devoto supermarket at Av. Roosevelt. Behind, you\\'ll find the Blv. Artigas road. Just behind the Devoto, there\\'s a tiny roundabout and a road entry where it\\'s possible to stand safely and stop cars. Rides might only be local, though try to hitch at least the 3-4km until the end of town to Ruta 39 (Option 2)\\n\\nOption 2: At the beginning of Ruta 39 in the north of Maldonado, there\\'s a traffic bridge connecting traffic from Punta del Este coming as well as from Maldonado Center for going north to \\'\\'San Carlos\\'\\'. Best spot is probably about 500m behind the bridge at the next bus stop, though slightly uphill, there\\'s traffic from Av. L.A. de Herrera is joining in. That road might be also useful for hitching a shortcut to the Ruta 10 at Punta Ballena.\\n\\n[[Category:Uruguay]]\\n{{Cities Uruguay}}\\n__NOTOC__',\n",

It is a member state of the [[European Union]] as well as the [[Schengen Agreement]]. \\n\\nIt is very densely populated, and there is very little distance between centres. Hitching is very easy though, often you don't even have to leave town. [[Gozo]] Island especially is very easy to hitch around. Everyone knows English, and many can communicate in Italian and Arabic.\\n\\nThere's also the little island of [[Comino]] where there's a free campground. Camp out here at night and walk to the Blue Lagoon in the early morning before the tourist stampede arrives and swim to the Cominotto rock which has a cool swimming cave. Comino has a few roads, but barely any traffic and all corners are walking distance anyway.\\n\\nTouchdown! That's a really cool way of ptuitng it!\\n\\n== Hitchhiking in/out ==\\n\\nAs Malta is an island, one has to go [[boathitching]]. [[User:MOAH|Mind of a Hitchhiker]] managed to hitchhike a yacht directly from [[Corfu]] in [[Greece]] in 2015 after spending six days dockwalking in the Gouvia Marina a few kilometers north of Corfu city. The closest land from Malta are [[Tunisia]] and [[Sicily]] in [[Italy]], but to the continent of [[Africa]] there's not a whole lot going especially after the attacks on hotels in Tunisia. Malta has a buttload of marinas with moored private yachts year round. Go to the captain's office so they know your face and purpose plus you can get access to the often locked docks. you have to have a telephone number to be called by the people with potential offers.\\n\\nThere's also a ferry going to [[Sicily]] on a daily basis which costs €140 one-way and €74 day return ticket. You're not being forced to return, so take the return ticket.\\n\\n== Public Transport ==\\n\\nPublic transport is very cheap, but can take quite a long time, especially during rush hour. The other annoyance is that almost all public transport is based from the main cities (Valleta in Malta, and Victoria on Gozo), so you have to always go there to make connections.\\n\\n\\n== Cities ==\\n* [[Valletta]]\\n\\n== Personal Experiences ==\\n''I really enjoyed hitchhiking around Malta, Gozo and Comino for the three weeks I was there. The population is very international and almost everybody works in the online casinos that Malta is hosting. Couchsurfing was easy, freecamping too on Gozo and Comino. It's bloody hot, but people are friendly and generous for such an expensive place. The Valletta, Sliema and St Julian's area are very densely populated, but people and buses are quite willing to pick you up for free. I even hitchhiked y first airplane here and saw the rock of Filfla from the sky. That's all of the Maltese territory. Hitchhiking a boat out turned out to be too difficult. I tried for seven days, but I would have found something if I wasn't under time pressure. You can find full reports on these events on my website.''

There is a big service station about 1 mile after the junction between the A556 (Chester Road) and the M6. It\\'s called \"Knutsford Services\". So even if the driver drops you at the junction you could probably stealthily walk the distance or just ask the driver to take you there seeing as it\\'s so close.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t want to hitch out of the city, a train to Knutsford costs around £6 and the walk from the train station to the services is around 30 mins.\\n\\n==Free showers==\\nMany University of Manchester buildings have shower facilities for students and staff who commute by bike. Some buildings have access gates which require you to present a student ID - if this is the case say you forgot your wallet at home and the reception staff will ask you to sign in (it\\'s just a piece of paper, for student no. make up any 7-digit number that begins with the no. 7). \\'\\'Here\\'s a map of buildings with shower facilities and access restrictions)\\'\\' {{Coords|53.4684693|-2.2421159|1}}\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n{{Category|City\\'s}}\\n[[Category:North West England]]\\n[[Category:E20]]\\n[[Category:E22]]\\n{{IsIn|North West England}}'},\n",

Tramway number 6A is going there (station ''Rangierbahnhof''). Some of the flatcar trains carrying (ISO) shipping containers go just a few kilometers into Mannheim Harbour.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== West and North ===\\nYou may take the Tramway to get near the motorway entrance ''Sandhofen''. Take the tramway number 3 (light blue) to the final station ''Sandhofen Endstelle''. From there it is less than a kilometer of walk to the entrance or the useful petrol station nearby.\\n\\n=== East and Southeast ===\\nMannheim is a bit of a trap if you're going that way, the most obvious thing to do is going behind the massive park and go along the Augustaanlage straße where it later becomes the highway, it may work on holidays and weekends, but even with massive traffic and space to stop, people didn't stop. \\nYour other option is to go to the train station take a train to hockenheim, walk past the town in direction of the highway until you reach woods with a cemetery on your right side going towards the south east, then you climb stairs overlooking the autobahn with a small bridge and go to the other side of the road then go down still along the highway and you will spot a service station, if you go near the bit where a restaurant is, the only fence is a small white fence you can easily cross, it's a good spot to get to Stuttgart or Heilbronn. \\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n{{hitchbase city|150}}\\n\\n[[Category:Baden-Württemberg]]\\n[[Category:E35]]\\n[[Category:E50]]\\n\\n[[de:Mannheim]]\",\n",

As one of the few German cities that have not been bombed during WWII, it is host to a pittoresque medieval inner city. It is great to hang out for a few days and friends can be made easily except for March and August when the city is almost empty from students due to university holidays.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== North towards [[Kassel]] on B3 and [[Alsfeld]] on B62 ===\\n==== Neue Kasseler Straße ====\\nThere is an on-ramp to the B3 at the intersection of \\'\\'Neue Kasseler Straße\\'\\' and \\'\\'Zimmermannstraße\\'\\', about 5 minutes walk from the train station. If you are planning to get to the Autobahn (see below) almost anyone can take you as far as to where the B3 hits the B62. There is a roundabout where you can be dropped and from there you should get to Alsfeld quite fast.\\n\\n==== ESSO petrol station ====\\nThere is an ESSO petrol station right in Marburg underneath \\'\\'Kurt-Schumacher-Brücke\\'\\' on the B3 motorway in northern direction. From there, it should be possible to reach Kassel on the B3 or the B62 roads to Alsfeld though it can take an hour or two as there are only few cars refuelling at this place. You reach the station within five minutes walking from the city center of Marburg. [[User:Wherever|Wherever]] tried this several times without success except once. Even if you get a lift, it will take you many cars to cover reasonable distance because the traffic is almost exclusively local. He thus highly recommends taking the southern route instead; even if heading North.\\n\\n==== via Gießen ====\\nYou also might consider going north via Gießen. It´s a little detour, but you reach the Autobahn A5 faster (it´s ~30 km to Gießen, but ~90 km to Kassel).\\n\\n=== Northward on {{Autobahn|A7}}/{{E|45}} [[Kassel]], [[Göttingen]], [[Hannover]], [[Hamburg]] and Southward on {{Autobahn|A5}}/{{E|40}} [[Frankfurt]], [[Darmstadt]], [[Basel]] ===\\n\\n==== City center ====\\nThere are two spots in the city center which can be anything between extremely rewarding and driving you nowhere except to desperation.\\n\\n* One of them is the \\'\\'\\'on-ramp at the central railway station\\'\\'\\' (\\'\\'Hauptbahnhof\\'\\' or \\'\\'Bahnhof\\'\\'), which has the advantages of offering a lot of traffic and a shelter from rain (it is underneath a brdge) and the disadvantages of you being somewhat in the dark (due to that same bridge) and relying on rather courageous drivers since there is no hard shoulder for the cars to stop. Drivers can see you for while as they are stopping at the red light not far from you. [[User:Wherever|Wherever]] got easy rides from here twice but gave up after more than two hours on another occasion (early morning, though).\\n* Another option is the on-ramp next to REWE at \\'\\'\\'Erlenring\\'\\'\\'. It is similar to the above except that you don\\'t have the benefits and drawbacks related to standing under a bridge. You\\'re quite exposed to the weather (hot in summer, cold in winter), but you have a supermarket nearby. Here, [[User:Wherever|Wherever]] also has a 2 in 3 success rate.\\n\\n==== Rasthof und Hotel Pfefferhöhe ====\\nA good place to travel in northern or southern direction on A5/E 40 is [http://www.pfefferhoehe.de/ Rasthof Pfefferhöhe] near [[Alsfeld]] on \\'\\'Grünberger Straße\\'\\'. According to googlemaps there is a McD\\'s restaurant at this place as well. If you have a season ticket (e. g. by being a university student in Marburg), you might want to consider taking the train or bus to Alsfeld, although it should also be possible to get to Alsfeld hitchhiking along the B62 within one hour. [[User:Wherever|Andi]] tried this several times without success except once and highly recommends taking the southern route instead; even if heading North.\\n\\n==== Aral service station (\"Aral-Tankstelle\") ====\\nAn easy way to hitch-hike out of Marburg in southern direction is the \\'\\'Aral\\'\\' petrol station near \\'\\'Südbahnhof\\'\\' (the train station in \\'\\'Frauenbergstraße\\'\\'). It doesn\\'t have a lot of traffic but if you are persistent and/or good at talking to people, you will eventually get a ride. To go there, you can either walk (about 30-45 minutes from the city center), or take a bus (lines 1, 4, 6, (7), [may not be up to date anymore!]). Get off the bus at \"Südbahnhof\". Cross the railway and motorway (B3) using the pedestrian bridge, then turn left (South, out of town) and follow the road named \"Am Krekel\" along the motorway. After about 3 minutes, you can see the blue sign of a petrol station (Aral) on your left. Usually the door in the fence around the service station is open, if not, just climb across it.\\n\\nThis spot is good for heading South (Gießen, Frankfurt, Switzerland, etc.) and West (Cologne, etc) but it is also worth considering when heading East and even North, since the other options for these directions are really poor. In this case, you need to change direction somewhere around Gießen, which is a little tricky but doable.\\n\\n== Hitching In ==\\n\\n\\n==== Coming from East and North ====\\nGet to the on-ramp 2 \"Alsfeld Ost\" on the A5. From there best continue with a sign \"Marburg\". Easy to get a ride from here especially in the afternoon.\\n\\n==== Coming from South ====\\nTry the petrol station \"Wetterau\" on the A5 and directly ask for Marburg. Might be lucky. If not take the detour to Alsfeld.\\n\\n__NOTOC__\\n\\n[[Category:Hesse]]\\n\\n[[de:Marburg]]',\n",

If you are coming from North using A11 take exit 16 for N211 towards Marco de Canaveses.\\nYou shouldn't have much trouble finding a lift from the tolls, as most of the drivers will take the road to Marco de Canaveses, or will drive through it. \\n\\n== Camping ==\\n\\nIf you want to do wild camping in Marco de Canaveses you have plenty of space and places besides the ones recommended here where you won't be bothered by anybody. \\n\\nParque de Merendas de Montedeiras is a really nice park located about 8 km from the centre of the town but very easily acceded.

When leaving the station, take the exit to your right-hand side and ask around for the bus (COP 2,550) going to the \"Pan de Azúcar\" neighborhood.\\nAsk the bus driver to point you towards the pedestrian bridge (\"puente peatonal\") crossing the highway going South (\"Autopista Sur\") . It should also be marked on your map though. On the other side of that bridge you will find a Terpel gas station (06°08′21.98″N 75°37′56.44″W). This is where you can start hitchhiking and asking people for a ride.\\n\\nAnother option from the same station is to take a bus past the next town of Caldas, to where Carrera 50 meets the highway. Several lines of the C9 bus route (001, 006) should get you there. You should also confirm with the driver; the area is called \\'\\'Primavera\\'\\'. It\\'s a good spot as the highway reduces there to only one lane from two, which in addition to the merging and cross traffic makes for a certain chaos that slows down drivers and will help get you a ride. There is also a Zeuss gasbar there right on the road, in addition to shops and restaurants, to talk with stopping drivers. Walking about a kilometre up the highway back toward Medellín you will also find a larger service station, if you so prefer.\\n\\n=== North to [[Cartagena]], East to [[Bucaramanga]] ===\\nTake the Metro north to the last station \\'\\'Niquia\\'\\', which is actually situated in a roundabout around which runs the highway to [[Cartagena]] and [[Bucaramanga]]. 15 kilometres ahead there is a tollbooth, \\'\\'El Trapiche\\'\\', with a gas station just beyond it. Buses running to \\'\\'Barbosa\\'\\', the next town, leave from \\'\\'Niquia\\'\\' and stop there at the gas station. Try the C7 001/002/003, check the Moovit app, or ask for buses going to Barbosa; some lines of the C7 do not go that far.\\n\\nThe 15 kilometres to the tollbooth is an industrial area and has several gas stations that, when [[User:Movethathoof|Movethathoof]] passed on the bus to the tollbooth, were full of truckers. A Mobil station, Primax - Cocorollo, and a Terpel, particularly caught their attention. The Texaco station just beyond the tollbooth was not especially busy, and so if you\\'re planning to speak to truckers directly those may be more fruitful.\\n\\nThere is also a gas station on the road between the metro stations \\'\\'Belo\\'\\' and \\'\\'Niquia\\'\\' but it doesn\\'t seem to be very useful.\\n\\nNote that the highway splits, heading either to [[Cartagena]] or to [[Bucaramanga]], only a short distance down the road past \\'\\'El Trapiche\\'\\' and before that next town of Barbosa. More truckers are going to Cartagena than in the direction of Bucaramanga, and so if you\\'re aiming for the latter another option, where all of the traffic will be headed that way, is a large Zeuss service station at the eastern exit of Barbosa. The same buses to Barbosa that get you to the \\'\\'El Trapiche\\'\\' tollbooth should get you to the town\\'s centro, less than a kilometre\\'s walk from this station.\\n\\nAlso worth noting is that the \\'\\'El Trapiche\\'\\' tollbooth is both quite cramped and busy, with a dedicated little slip for motos there where you probably want to stand, in addition to all of the trucks and other traffic, and people making sales to the traffic. That moto traffic was eventually to the benefit of [[User:Movethathoof|Movethathoof]], though, when a young man offered to strap his oversized pack to his sporty little bike and give him a ride over three hundred kilometres down the road!\\n\\n=== East/South-East to [[Bogotá]], [[Rionegro]], [[Guatape]] ===\\nTake the metro north and stop at \"Madera\" station. Walk South and cross the bridge towards Zamora neighbor. Just after the bridge, there is a petrol station where you can ask rides.\\nYou can also walk 500 meters more following the highway to reach a second gaz station. The hitchhiking spot is better from the second one.\\n\\n=== South-East to [[Sonson]] via Route 56 ===\\nTake a bus to Avenida Las Palmas. I started in Poblado, which is still in the city but worked fine. From here you can either directly start to hitch hike or take a bus to Las Palmas where you find a Toll booth (Peaje).\\n\\n== Personal Experiences ==\\n:\\'\\'As the most well-ordered city in the country, the public transit makes it easy to get out of this city. From the last metro station to the north, for example, you can get a city bus to Barbosa, from which the hitch to Bucaramanga can begin!\\'\\' -[[User:Chael777|Chael777]]\\n\\n:\\'\\'March 2014; the metro line wasn\\'t running all the way South, so I went to Envigado, and began walking from there.

Despite its notoriety, hitchhiking in Mexico is not only possible but it can be a rather enjoyable experience. Due to its sheer size it\\'s impossible to give a general hitchability rating for this country: the experiences vary from state to state. As anywhere, you can go fast on highways and very slow on small less used roads.\\n\\nAvoid disappointment and unnecessary loss of money by keeping your proof of payment of the tourist fee when you enter the country! They will want to see it again when you leave.\\n\\n== License plates == \\nMexican license plates are very easy to interpret: The name of the issuing federal state is written on them (as you will easily notice once in the country). When traveling longer distances or in central Mexico with its many small states it can therefore be useful knowing which state your destination is in (if you have one).\\n\\n== Cities ==\\n__TOC__\\n* [[Acapulco]]\\n* [[Arriaga]]\\n* [[Campeche]]\\n* [[Cancun]]\\n* [[Ciudad Valles]]\\n* [[Culiacán]]\\n* [[Guadalajara]]\\n* [[Guanajuato (city)| Guanajuato]]\\n* [[Mexico City]] (capital)\\n* [[Oaxaca (City)|Oaxaca]]\\n* [[Palenque]]\\n* [[Poza Rica]]\\n* [[Puebla (city)|Puebla]]\\n* [[Querétaro (city)| Querétaro]]\\n* [[San Cristóbal de las Casas]]\\n* [[San Luis Potosí (city)| San Luis Potosí]]\\n* [[Tehuantepec]]\\n* [[Toluca]]\\n* [[Tuxtla]]\\n* [[Xalapa (City)|Xalapa]]\\n\\n== Hitchability and General Advice==\\n\\nHitchability in Mexico varies wildly depending on the region and on the setting. by the touristic coast of Oaxaca, for example, it\\'s extremely easy to find rides, while you might wait a few hours on low-traffic rural roads or by the overwhelmingly crowded \\'\\'casetas de cobro\\'\\' near Mexico City.\\n\\nA peculiarity of Mexican hitchhiking are the ubiquitous pick-up trucks where you just jump in the back, hold onto your hat, kiss the wind and forget about communicating with the driver. Many people will offer you food and drinks, especially Coca Cola! On routes with poor public transportation, payment is sometimes expected and ordinary pickups magically turn into \\'\\'collectivos\\'\\' (shared taxis).\\n\\nOn the small roads, however, hitchhiking can sometimes be time-consuming – waiting times of 2–3 hours are not unheard of. Be prepared with patience, water and sun cream. Although in many places locals hitch to get home from the grocery store for instance, hitchhiking as a lifestyle or as a means of long-distance travel is not so common in Mexico and not everybody might immediately understand what you want. So, on the mountain roads for instance, your brain should be wired more to enjoy the magnificent views and eating the abundance of fruit nature has on offer rather than making a lot of progress.\\n\\nAs for security, most hitchhikers never encounter any major problems. Mexico is an enormous country and experiences vary a lot from state to state. If you want to avoid risks, you can avoid the states close to the border with USA - Tamaulipas, Coahuila, Chihuahua and Durango, i.e. take buses and collectivos when traveling north of the line between Tampico, San Luis Potosi and Mazatlan (the map). Apparently also the states of Guerrero and Michoacán (mostly by the coast), Sinaloa and Veracruz can be risky.\\n\\nIf you go hitchhiking in Mexico, being able to speak and understand at least a bit of Spanish is nearly mandatory. Apart from touristic areas, most people you encounter do not speak English, unless they have lived in the US which isn\\'t all that infrequent. Still, if you know Spanish you can communicate way better with people and get a closer connection with them. Useful [[Spanish]] words are \"ride\" and \"aventón\", both meaning a lift. Near the [[Guatemala|Guatemalan]] border the word \"jalón\" is used.  No one understands what hitchhiking or autostop means so say “busco/buscamos un ride” instead when looking for a ride.\\n\\n=== Signs ===\\n\\nSigns are almost always unnecessary in Mexico. However they really seem to help when you\\'re hitching at a \\'\\'caseta de cobro\\'\\', especially when the highway splits soon after.\\n\\nIf you\\'re in an area with a lot of local traffic, it might be useful to make a sign that says \"Siguiente Gasolinera\" (next gas station). Then you can get a ride to a better hitchhiking spot. Similarly, signs that say \"reten\" (checkpoint) or \"caseta\" (tollbooth) can be really useful, especially when cars are passing quickly and the checkpoint or tollbooth is only 10 or 20 km away.\\n\\n=== Where to hitchhike? ===\\n\\nYou can hitchhike pretty much everywhere, even on the highway (although pretty much no one stops at such high speeds). In general, asking at gas stations (\\'\\'gasolinera\\'\\') or even traffic lights (\\'\\'semáforo\\'\\'), especially on bus stops and the like, can get you far pretty easily. According to [[User:Zenit|Zenit]], Mexicans are much more likely to stop if you can try to hitch them at low speeds; speed bumps offer themselves for this purpose. Sometimes it is better to be among the cars, in the traffic lights, and directly ask rides from people who have open windows. Sometimes you can just jump in the back of a pick-up without even telling where you are going and just tap on the window when you want to get off. \\n\\nOther good places include exits from shopping centers, in truck stops or at the restaurants where truckers eat. Some petrol stations in the north don\\'t allow people to do that, but you can try to speak with the manager. It works sometimes. Otherwise, just stay by the cashier of the petrol station or at the door (they can\\'t forbid you that) and ask. \\n\\nMexico also has many border control and military and police checkpoints (\\'\\'retén\\'\\') in the middle of the highways throughout the country. These can be great for hitchhiking. It\\'s usually good practice to ask the personnel for permission beforehand, and oftentimes they\\'ll be asking all the drivers where they\\'re going, so they can even let you know if someone\\'s going to your destination.\\n\\n[[File:Tope-mexico.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Hitching at a tope (speedbump)]]\\n\\nYou can also catch long rides at the exits of the cities when you travel on the highways. Many cities have speed bumps (\\'\\'tope\\'\\') where the highway begins at the edge of town. Where there are police posts at the entrance or exits to towns, there are usually topes too. On smaller highways in more rural areas, there are often speed bumps at every little town, making it easy to move quickly with a number of shorter rides.\\n\\nMany of the larger, faster highways operate on a toll system. It\\'s common for there to be a free road (\\'\\'libre\\'\\') parallel to the paid one (\\'\\'cuota\\'\\'), the former being slower and easier to catch rides, but the latter much more likely for getting longer rides. The tollbooths (\\'\\'caseta\\'\\') can be good places too, and the ones near the cities can usually be reached by local transport. However, sometimes you might be told to stand about 100m past the tollbooth itself, so traffic has often already picked up speed by the time they get to you and it can be difficult for cars to pull over. Fortunately, there are often restrooms, gas stations and stores just past the \\'\\'caseta\\'\\', so you can talk to drivers that stop there. Signs can come in really handy at tollbooths.\\n\\nIn some mid-sized cities like [[Tampico]], Oaxaca, and [[Pachuca]] there are no transit roads and you have to cross the city. Taking a bus makes things easier.\\n\\n== Safety ==\\n\\nIt is even less recommendable than in other countries to take drugs or weapons with you, especially since after 2010 the Mexican government, backed by the US DEA who are actually present in Mexico (!!), have decided to crack down on drug and weapon trafficking. This has declined again since the following government of Peña Nieto seems to be more friendly towards the narcos. There still are numerous checkpoints all around the country, but in general it doesn\\'t seem very likely that you will be checked and the soldiers hardly ever search all the way through a large back-pack, unless you answer their questions really bad. If the vehicle you\\'re riding in does get stopped just stay calm, show your passport, say the magic words \"\\'\\'turista\\'\\'\" (\"tourist\") and \"\\'\\'de paseo nada más\\'\\'\" (\"just passing\"), and if they ask to see your stuff open you bag and show them that it\\'s all clothes and stuff. Small quantities of marijuana are decriminalized and police officers can probably be convinced to overlook them with a small payment, although of course the Hitchwiki community endorses neither drug possession nor bribery. ;-) Be aware that knives are illegal as they are considered \"lethal weapons\" according to Mexican law and can theoretically be punished by up to five years of prison.\\n\\nIn the south, your drivers might ask you about your immigration status and advise you of immigration check points.\\n\\n=== Single Women ===\\n\\n[[Image:20180310 123251.jpg|thumb|240px|left|my girl Ave ride beggin\\' in San Isidro Mazatepec, Jalisco- a pueblo harboring my favorite taco stand with the most toppings you\\'ll ever want [two_string_sally]\\n]]\\n\\nOne of the great things of hitchhiking in Mexico is that even if you travel alone, you rarely have to hitch-hike alone, because hitchhiking is such a common activity among locals - joining locals hitching will not only add to the fun, but also your safety.

It is still easy to stop rides and ask them to stop for you on the junction to Belize.\\nThe border crossing itself is a bit confusing. There are two different customs in different locations for entering and exiting Mexico.\\nThe locals tend to not know so well the rules because they don\\'t apply on them the same as tourist.\\n\\nExiting Mexico was super easy. There is a white room in the middle of the road where a lady just stumped my passport with barely any questions.\\nShe did tell me that if I wish to go back to Mexico in this border crossing it will cost me 750 Mexican pesos and a flight ticket as a proof that I am leaving Mexico.\\n\\nThe Belizean customs are not so close to the Mexican customs. Luckily I had locals helping me, driving me around.\\nIn the Belizean customs you need to fill a standard paper stating your name, passport number etc...\\nI was told to fill that I will stay only 30 days in Belize. They inform you that you can ask for 30 days more later and it will cost 100 US dollars.\\nYou have to state to which hotel are you going.\\nI just filled a name I found online and no questions were asked.\\nLater they might check your bags to see if you are smuggling anything ilegal, like fruit and veggies from Mexico.\\n\\nThere is a bus stop just after the customs and even the police told me I can hitchhike there.\\nEveryone in the Belizean side seem to prefer speaking English.\\n\\n=== To/From [[Guatemala]] ===\\nGuatemala and Mexico had 10 formal border crossings in 2004:\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ciudad Hidalgo, Chiapas – Ciudad Tecún Umán, San Marcos\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nHitchhiking in Chiapas to the border is not so easy.

Without checking your bags.\\n\\nEntering Mexico might be harder. Depends on your luck.\\nSome get checked quite a lot and might get denied while others might cross with no problem. \\n\\nAs you continue towards Guatemala, you will face a Turn gate with a guard. \\nCrossing costs 5 Mexican Pesos or 5 US Dollars I have no clue why.\\nBetter to keep with you a 5 Peso Coin before you start crossing because you pay the gate and not the guard through a machine coin slot.\\n\\nYou cross the gate and start to cross the bridge towards Guatemala.\\nYou will probably be swarmed by different type of taxis wishing to take you to the other side.\\nThe walk to the other side is about a 2 minute easy walk, So it is not really a must to take a taxi.\\n\\nOn the other side many people will offer you to exchange Money from Pesos to Quetzales.\\nThey Don’t offer the best ratio.\\nThe Immigration office it self is very small. It will be quite of a long wait if there are many people at the crossing when you arrive.\\nBut beside that the workers barely ask any questions and give you passage to Guatemala and 90 days with No questions at all. They Don’t check you bags either.  \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Talismán, Chiapas – El Carmen, San Marcos\\'\\'\\'\\nPlease add information if you crossed this border.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Union Juárez, Chiapas – Toquían Grande, San Marcos\\'\\'\\'\\nPlease add information if you crossed this border.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Mazapa de Madero, Chiapas – Sibinal, San Marcos\\'\\'\\'\\nPlease add information if you crossed this border.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Ciudad Cuahtemoc, Chiapas – La Mesilla, Huehuetenango\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nThis crossing is considered one of the more forgiving crossings.\\nPeople who work in tourism for the last 20 years in Guatemala say that the likelihood of a person to get denied access to Mexico in La Mesilla is much lower than other crossings between Guatemala and Mexico.\\nThat being said, Many locals considered this crossing dangerous because some incidents that happen with the Mafia.\\n\\nComing from Guatemala hitchhiking to the border is relatively easy. Towards the final part it gets a little bit harder.\\nThere are many Mini-buses you can take if it takes you too long.\\nA lot of them pass all the time on the main road.\\n\\nIn La mesilla the mini bus drops you a bit far for the border crossing.\\nYou can take a taxi or walk down hill on the main road for about 8 minutes.\\n\\nThe immigration office in Guatemala is quite ok.\\nThey just check your passport and immediately stamped it. No questions. They didn\\'t check my bags when I crossed there.\\n\\nAfter crossing you are in a buffer zone between Mexico and Guatemala.\\n\\nAnd the distance is a little bit far. About 5 minutes by car. People said it is dangerous to walk it.\\nIf you prefer not to walk there are taxis waiting at the buffer zone.\\n\\nThey bring you straight to the Mexican immigration office.\\n\\nThe Mexican immigration is a bit tougher. They asked me what\\'s my plan for Mexico and for how long.\\nI asked for 180 days And they said they can only give me 90 days and it will cost 861 Mexican pesos (January 2025).\\nI think they keep it always at 50 Us dollars.\\n\\nAll the conversation was in Spanish, and the workers seemed a little bit angry.\\nEventually they sent me to the building next door to pay.\\n\\nIn the next building there was no one. And after 10 minutes someone came to the toll booth. After paying he gave me a large paper and told me to go to where I was before.\\n\\nThey stamped my passport and the large paper I brought and told me to guard it well.\\nThis paper was checked many times while I was in Mexico. And they took it from me when I left Mexico.\\nSo i think it is important.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Carmen Xhán, Chiapas – Gracias a Dios, Huehuetenango\\'\\'\\'\\nPlease add information if you crossed this border.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Nuevo Orizaba, Chiapas – Ingenieros, El Quiché\\'\\'\\'\\nPlease add information if you crossed this border.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' Frontera Corozal, Chiapas - Bethel, El Petén\\'\\'\\'\\nPlease add information if you crossed this border.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' El Ceibo, Tabasco – El Ceibo, El Petén\\'\\'\\'\\nPlease add information if you crossed this border.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'El Martillo, Tabasco – El Naranjo, El Petén\\'\\'\\'\\nPlease add information if you crossed this border.\\n\\n== Food ==\\n\\nVegetarians/vegans: if you ask food carts or taco places if they have anything vegetarian, and they say no, look at the ingredients they\\'ve got in their work area and get creative!

In [[Baja California]], there is only one road, the HWY 1, which isn\\'t hell to hitchhike on but requires a lot of patience: there are often large distances in between cities (which are barely even cities, rather a few ranches and cactus farms) and even larger distances between petrol stations (example: El Rosario is the last one before Guerrero Negro, about 360 km further down in [[Baja California Sur]]). Getting stuck in the middle of the desert is NOT fun, and many people can only take you from town to town as it is local traffic or gringos doing one of the many races down in the Baja. Also, unless you are planning on staying in Baja and going back up towards the USA-Mexico border, you should hitchhike from [[Mexicali]] south.

I came down Baja California, hitched a sailboat from La Paz to Mazatlán, steamed over to [[Veracruz (City)|Veracruz]] for the carnival, went up and around the Yucatán, then down into [[Chiapas]], Guatemala, and then back to Veracruz, across to all the big central cities, and down the Pacific coast to Oaxaca and Guatemala once more. I got picked up by plenty of self-proclaimed drug dealers. Whatever. Lovely country.\\'\\' - [[User:Chael777|Chael777]]\\'\\', August 2011\\n\\n\\'\\'I hitched at exits and on-ramps and speed bumps (topes) and made excellent time from [[Matamoros]] to [[Catemaco]]. As long as cars are going somewhat slow any place is really a good place to hitchhike. I rarely waited more than fifteen minutes. People were very hospitable. I was treated to lots of delicious food and given places to stay by those who picked me up. This is my favorite country to hitchhike thus far\\'\\' - [[User:Eripson|Eripson]], March 2012\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'The small less trafficky roads, in the mountains and in Chiapas for instance, can test your patience. If you are coming from south (Guatemala) people might be afraid to pick you up because there are so many checkpoints. Even the ones who do stop ask if you have problems with authorities, if you are smuggling drugs or if you have a passport.\\'\\' - [[User:Astikain|Astikain]] ([[User talk:Astikain|talk]]) 15:59, 4 June 2013 (CEST) \\n\\n\\n\\'\\'I hitchhiked for two months through the mainland and had a great experience. People are very friendly and willing to help. The biggest thing is getting outside the city. The good thing about the big highways is you are more likely to get a long ride, the bad thing it can be rough to have someone pull over. The small villages are easier to get rides but tend to be short.\\'\\' - Jason\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'ANDALE!

It is located in the west of the country, bordering the states of [[Colima]] and [[Jalisco]] to the west, [[Guanajuato]] and [[Querétaro]] to the north, [[Mexico State]] to the east, and [[Guerrero]] to the southeast.\\n\\nIts capital is [[Morelia]].\\n\\nIn the past years, it has gained a terrible reputation due to the heavy drug cartel activities.\\nGenerally, foreigners don\\'t have problems with organized crime, but people are not as trusting in this area and it might be a little more difficult to find a ride. Even with the organized crime, Michoacán keeps on being one of the most popular and beautiful states of Mexico, with many different things to see.\\n\\n== Cities and Places to Visit ==\\n\\n=== Monarch Butterflies Sanctuary ===\\nFrom November to March the Monarch Butterflies can be found in the area close to Mexico State.They can be found in [[Angangueo]], [[Ocampo]] and some other areas.\\n\\n=== Turtle Camps ===\\n[[File:Maruata.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Walking towards the turtle camp in Maruata, Michoacán.]]\\nThe marine turtles visit the coast all year round to lay their eggs, but the main season is during late summer and early autumn. They can be found from [[Chiapas]] to [[Nayarit]], including the coast of Michoacán. One of the most beautiful locations is [[Maruata]]. The workers at the turtle camps protect the eggs, which are often stolen by locals to be sold in the black market for their \"aphrodisiac\" qualities.\\n\\n=== Pátzcuaro ===\\n[[Pátzcuaro]] and the near-by towns are famous for the celebration of Day of the Death at the beginning of November.\\n\\n=== Morelia ===\\n[[Morelia]] is a beautiful colonial city and the capital of the state. There is a university which offers a major in Environmental studies, so there are many young people involved in activist movements. Morelia also hosts one of the most important Film Festivals of the country in October. There is a lot of art and culture in this beautiful historical city.\\n\\n=== Uruapan ===\\nClose to the city of [[Uruapan]] you can find one of the world\\'s youngest volcanoes, the \\'\\'Paricutín\\'\\'. Closeby are the remains of a little village buried by the lava. You have to hitchhike to a village called Angahuan to get there.\\n\\n== Places to avoid ==\\n[[Apatzingán]] is where most of the violent crime related to drugs happens.\\n\\n== Accommodation and Sleep ==\\nMichoacán is one of the most famous locations for marine turtle camps. There are many beautiful beaches that are protected for that reason, so no hotels can be built. The turtles camps always allow you to camp for free, sometimes asking you to do a little bit of work in exchange.

If you are dropped at a petrol station on the outskirts of Milano, it will probably prove faster to take public transportation across the city and hitchhike from the other side, than to try to get a lift around the city.\\n\\n== Hitching out ==\\n\\n \\n=== East towards [[Verona]], [[Slovenia]] {{Ait|4}} {{European Route Number|64}} ===\\n\\nBoth petrol station are still on Milano ring road, which means most of people will be going just nearby the city. Refuse any lift which doesn\\'t go at least after Agrate ask for a big Agip Brianza petrol station  from there finding lifts will be super-easy though don\\'t risk to get stuck on the motorway that is illegal.\\n\\nBest combination to go to Venice or Slovenia is: ringroad station > Agip Brianza station > Sommacampagna (Verona) Bauli Station > Arino (Padova) Limenella Station -> further\\n\\n==== Option 1: Area Di Servizio Cologno Est rest stop ====\\n\\nTake metro 2 (green line) to Cologno Nord. Exit to the left and go down the stairs to the right, you should see a parking with buses. Keep walking straight (northeast) for ≈600m along Via C.A. dalla Chiesa to the junction (there is a bridge over the motorway to the left). Keep walking straight on along the edge of the field (there\\'s a fence blocking your access on the motorway side) for 200m until you arrive at a big electricity pole with a couple of doors under it leading you to the service station on A51 highway.\\n\\n==== Option 2: Autogrill Cascina Gobba Est rest stop ====\\n\\nTake metro 2 (green) direction Cologne Nord or Gessate and get off at Cascina Gobba. From the platform right where you get out of the train, there begins a footbridge over the motorway leading to an extra train which only goes to a hospital Ospedale San Raffaele. It costs 1.20€. After you get out at the hospital, follow the stream of people and go up the first steps you see (round ones). Look for a high place – from there you can see a Eni petrol station. It is best is to ask someone to show you the best way down to the petrol station.\\n\\n=== Southeast towards [[Bologna]] {{European Route Number|35}} ===\\n\\nWalk for around 10 minutes from Porto Di Mare metro station to the Tamoil petrol station on the other side of the motorway. Look on the city map in metro stations how to walk there exactly\\n\\n=== South towards [[Genova]] {{European Route Number|62}} ===\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nYou can try hitching from the rest stop Autogrill Cantalupa Ovest. There are 2 options to get there:\\n\\n# Take the metro to the station \\'\\'Famagosta\\'\\' and 2.5 km walk down by A7  at the end of Via Giuseppe de Finetti street is Autogrill Cantalupa Ovest rest stop\\n# Catch bus 46 after you leave Famagosta.  Take it just 1? stop about 5 minutes.  There is a pizza place called Fratelli Diversi by the bus stop. (Big green sign). Ahead you’ll see a pedestrian bridge over the motorway which leads right to a service station on the highway and the advantage of being able to talk to people.\\n\\nBut be aware, the police station Polizia Stradale Milano Ovest is close by, so many police cars come here to refuel. Since Italy is the only European country where it is technically illegal to hichhike on the rest stops and the Italian police is generally not the nicest towards hitchhikers, it is a litte bit risky and you might get kicked out if you don\\'t find a ride fast enough.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nTake the M2 Metro until the very last stop called Assago Milanofiori Forum. When leaving the metro, walk across the bridge west above the Autostrada and exit the bridge at the big stadium Unipol Forum. there is a road going towards the roundabout from you, walk in the direction \\'\\'\\'away\\'\\'\\' from the roundabout (and NOT on the car bridge). after 100m or so there is a tunnel underneath the car bridge, cross it. You are now entering a huge, abandoned? parking lot. Walk until the middle of the parking lot and turn left to the entrance gate. The coordinates are roughly 45.4054056, 9.1448394. All of the cars on that road are going onto the highway but you are not yet on the Autostrada, so the police has nothing to complain about. The cars are not too fast and there is plenty of space to stop on the sides of the parking lot.\\n\\n=== West towards [[Torino]] {{European Route Number|64}} ===\\n\\n==== Option 1: Slipway Via Antonio Sant\\'Ellia ====\\n\\nAt the end of Via Antonio Sant\\'Ellia (metro station QT8 on the red line) close to the park Monte Stella, there is a big slipway to the full motorway interchange between A8 and A4.  So it is possible to hitch to west, north and east from there. Stand on the curb before the slipway splits with a sign. There is a street lamp nearby, so it is possible to hitch at night. N.B. occassionally there is street prostitution on the other side of the road close to stadium San Carlo.\\n\\n==== Option 2: Via Fratelli Rizardi traffic light ====\\n\\nAnother good place where you can catch more westwards traffic is at metro stop Molino Dorino. There is a roundabout which splits the ramps and car park driveways. Stand at the traffic light close to Via Fratelli Rizardi with a sign. Because of the traffic light, cars need stop longer before ramping onto the motorway tangenziale ovest A50, so you have more chance to be seen and longer time for the driver to think.\\n\\n==== Option 3: Q8 and McDonald\\'s on Viale Alcide de Gasperi ====\\n\\nGood spot to go to Torino/French Alps and it was really good and actually it’s possible to go in the other directions too - like [[Verona]], [[Venice]]. It’s a petrol station/McD near of the metro station QT8. It’s necessary to walk in Via Collecchio and cross the bridge. There is a park in the end of the bridge and you must follow the path until find a small street called Via Don Luigi Palazzolo and turn right in the road. Around 100 m further you will find the petrol station where you can ask for someone there or you can go directly to the road with a sign. I got a ride directly to [[Chamonix]] (France) and the driver was on his way to [[Geneva]]. This spot is less than 10 minutes walking from the metro station.\\n\\nEDIT (09/2021): Didn\\'t worked for me, waited for 5 hours without result. There was no one going to Torino, one car going to Switzerland and most of the traffic was going to Milano city centre or other cities like Verona. Afterwards I went to the Pero Nord petrol station and found a ride to Torino in less than 30 minutes.\\n\\n==== Option 4: Area Servizio Pero Nord ====\\n\\nGetting to a service area on the Autostada is very simple. One takes the Metro Line 1 to Pero station (direction Rho Fiera Milano: trains on Line 1 alternate destinations between Rho Fiera Milano and Bisceglie, which is to the southwest), and then walking southwest on the little pedestrian street onto which the station exits (Via Mario Greppi) you turn right on Via Oratorio. Follow it to the end where to your left there will be a roundabout; enter the roundabout and take the first right onto Via Papa Giovanni XXIII. You\\'ll see a water tower of sorts in the distance, which is to where you walk. Just below and beside the tower, on your right, there will be a little paved walkway which is a pedestrian and bike trail over the highway. You\\'ll see the service area to your left as you\\'re crossing the highway. Follow the trail as it continues just below the station\\'s fence and shortly you\\'ll find a revolving metal door that provides easy pedestrian access, and then you\\'re in! A map of these directions can be found [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yBP-giXHtgj3lCH7x0XUXrFzK4fhCx41&usp=sharing here]; it takes around 20 minutes walking. \\n\\nIt is not the busiest of all service areas, but there is a steady flow of traffic; many trucks stop here for their pausa, and many take the turn right after the station onto the {{Ait|50}} on their way to Switzerland.\\n\\n=== North towards Como,[[Switzerland]] {{Ait|8}} {{Ait|9}} ===\\n\\nThere is a petrol station on the A8, before the junction where the A9 branches off, leading towards Switzerland. \\nYou can reach it by taking a local train to the community of Rho (\\'\\'\\'S5 or S6\\'\\'\\' should go there, 5 stops, 2-3 Euros but there are no barriers et5. Important: \\'\\'\\'Don\\'t take the metro to Rho\\'\\'\\' - it stops at the Expo site 5km before Rho central) and then taking a \\'\\'\\'bus Z113\\'\\'\\' towards Lainate (direction is Saronno; bus is blue). \\n\\n[[File:Bus-rho-lainate.jpg]]\\n\\nThe bus should cost around 1,55 Euros. Get off at the stop \\'\\'\\'Via Pagliera\\'\\'\\' (the stop isn\\'t called Pagliera anymore, but it\\'s right after the roundabout) or Via Alessandro Manzoni, and walk towards the little roundabout between Via Giacomo Puccini, Via Scarlati and Via Gaetano Donizetti. This is an industrial area, just walk to the end of Via Gaetano Donizetti, you will reach the petrol station, southwards (there is a turnstile in the fence - when you get closer to the area keep left to find it). \\n\\nOn the petrol station, find the \\'\\'\\'sottopassagio\\'\\'\\'/underground walkway which will take you to the other side. From there, it should be easy to get a hitch on the A8 or A9 northwards, towards Lago Maggiore, Lago di Como, Switzerland.\\n\\nTo Lago di Como it is quick to get a ride from 45°29\\'59.9\"N 9°07\\'50.6\"E. Off the record: if you are taking the train from Como back to Milan after 21, they almost never check tickets.\\n\\n==== Option 2.  Service Station directly on the A9. (Lario Est) ====\\n\\nYou can take a regional train heading towards Como and get off at Cadorago.  (Very unlikely to get checked for a ticket but there is a barrier at Milano Cadorna.). Then cross the parking lot at the station to the roundabout.  Then heading away from the tracks, follow Via Roma for about 500 meters until SP26 (Via Alessandro Volta).  Turn right and go about 600 meters to via Giacomo Puccini.  Turn right and go about 400 meters and you will arrive at the service station. Unfortunately, the gate on the back was closed when I got there. I tried asking the attendant, who just arrived through the gate, and she said it was closed and I would have to go around. There is a fence all around the Autostrada but when you go far enough north there is a small hole in the fence (close to the tunnel). You have to fight your way through thorny blackberry bushes though. After that you can walk back from the other side of the fence. From here you should easily be able to find a ride into Switzerland and across the Alps.\\n\\n== Sleeping ==\\n\\nThe hospitality exchange community is one of the biggest in Italy, you should not have problems finding a host on Couchsurfing etc.\\n\\nIf you hitch at Monte Stella, there are plenty of long benches in the park and a public water tap nearby. It\\'s a good place to stay on a summer night.\\n\\nParco Nord (tramway 31 or 4, taking from yellow subway zara or maciachini) can be a nice spot to camp. Big enough to hide, lots of tap water. Parco Lambro may also be a good place for free camping. However, there is risk of theft in either park. All other parks inside the city (Giardini di Porta Venezia, Parco Sempione, Parco Solari) are closed during the night. \\n\\n== Eating in Milano ==\\n\\nThe are two places Milano where you can have free food. Both give food for homeless, poor people and are called [http://www.panequotidiano.eu/contatti/ \"Pane Quotidiano\"] (It means \"daily bread\")\\nThey usually give some bread, pasta, vegetables and sweets every day without asking you money or papers from 7:00 to 11:00.\\nOne is located in Viale Monza 335 you can arrive easily there with the Red Metro Line in Villa San Giovanni the other one is located in Viale Toscana 28 you can arrive there with the bus 90. You can recognize it easily because you can see lots of people waiting there.

It is a \"new town\" and as such employs a relatively unique road system for the UK (see end of this article), which hitchhikers would do well to bear in mind.\\n\\n== Hitching In ==\\nHitchhiking into the town is generally considered to be relatively easy given its location and the consistently high volume of road traffic that travels into Milton Keynes.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\nHitchhiking out of Milton Keynes has proven to be difficult, especially within the limits of the town, as in most places. Milton Keynes, being so recently and constantly developed, does not have a core centre with regard to the road network. As such it can be difficult to judge precisely when one is out of town! Despite this the high number of bus stops, lay-bys and petrol stations on major roads through town (including the A509, A422, A4146 and A5130) enable potential hitchhiking. \\n\\nThe closest motorway to \\'\\'\\'Milton Keynes\\'\\'\\' is the {{Mgb|1}}, which runs across the east of the town. Hitchhikers looking to join the {{Mgb|1}} from \\'\\'\\'Milton Keynes\\'\\'\\' might try the A509 (H5 Portway) around the areas of Newlands or Pineham, though alternative access points will not be difficult to locate on both the A421 or A422.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'The Grid System\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nIt is worth noting that the road names given above also go by different names on the ground, \\'\\'\\'Milton Keynes\\'\\'\\' is based on a grid system road network, and major roads are named H (for horizontal) and V (for vertical) and are assigned a number, i.e. H5. This makes navigation within the town itself very easy given that you know where you want to end up. However, it can be confusing as to which A-road or B-road you are on! It is also worth mentioning that the majority of the main roads through \\'\\'\\'Milton Keynes\\'\\'\\' are bordered by wide (often VERY wide) grass verges which make navigating the road network on foot very easy. Also the majority of the \"Redway\" paths that run all over the town match up conveniently with the road network, emerging at bus stops which might make good hitching spots for example.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}',\n",

Get off at the station \"Pavarot na Sosny\" (\"Паварот на Сосны\") on the top of the junction. You can try hitching just after the junction or walk 2 km towards junction of M4 (towards [[Mahilioŭ]]) and M5 (towards [[Homiel]]) roads.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can take bus #93 from the same station and get off right after it turns off from the motorway, walk a few hundred metres in the same direction with the traffic to the closest bus stop on the motorway to start hitchhiking from there.\\n\\n\\n=== South-East towards [[Barysaŭ]], [[Moscow]], [[Russia]] ===\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\'\\n\\ntake Metro (1st (blue line \"Maskoŭskaja linija\")) to \\'\\'Uručča\\'\\' (\"Уручча\") station, then get bus #15, #99 (direction \\'Vajennja akademija\\' (Ваенная акадэмія) to \\'\\'Vitalur\\'\\' (\"Виталюр\") stop, get out and walk 0.5km NE along the road.

Get off at the turn from M1 to \\'Sokal\\'. Spot is right after the crossing.\\n\\nAn alternative is to take any public transport going to the airport of Minsk. It is outside the city on the road to Moscow. If you let yourself drop on the last turn before the airport, you are on a perfect spot and direct lifts to Moscow are not uncommon.\\n\\n\\n=== South-West towards [[Brest (Belarus)|Brest]], [[Poland]] ===\\n\\nTake Metro (1st (blue) line Maskoŭskaja linija) to \"Malinaŭka\" (\"Малінаўка\") station.

From the train station, looking south you can see the national road. Much traffic stops at villages further down the road, but it is easy to hitch onwards.\\n\\n=== West towards [[Budapest]] ===\\n\\nIt is very easy to get a ride to Budapest from Miskolc as there is a direct motorway (M30) to the Hungarian capital and most of the drivers are heading directly to Budapest. However, the road leading to the motorway is quite far away from the city center, so you must take bus 4 from ''Búza tér'' or bus 44 from the bus stop ''Centrum'' to the Cora hypermarket on the edge of the city. After getting off, look for the road 304 in front of the Cora parking lot. Walk down the road and thumb next to the sign marking the end of Miskolc.\\n\\n=== Public Transport ===\\n\\nPublic transport in Miskolc is not the densest, but you can reach all the important places in reasonable time with the various bus lines and the tram line. However, blackriding is nearly impossible in Miskolc as you have to get at the first door and the driver checks your ticket, so you'd better buy a ticket. Tickets can be bought at various ticket offices for 280 Forints (1€) or on the spot for 360 Forints (1.2€) Schedules and route numbers can be found at http://mkvzrt.hu (also available in English).\\n\\n\\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\\n\\n[[nomad:Miskolc]] [[trash:Miskolc]]\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|Hungary}}\\n[[Category:Hungary]]\\n[[Category:E71]]\\n[[Category:E79]]\\n\\n [[ru:Мишкольц]]\",\n",

Whether arriving to or departing from Montevideo, expect to use public transportation to get you into/out of town. \\n\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n\\n===North towards [[Canelones]] (Ruta 5), West towards [[Colonia del Sactamento]], [[Argentina]] (Ruta 1) ===\\n\\n'''Option 1'''\\n\\nYou can take bus #137 (Paso de la Arena), #370 (Cerro) or 17 (Casabo) from the roundabout at Palacio Legislativo. These buses most likely also pass downtown. The bus stop is behind the Palacio, next to the José Batlle y Ordóñez monument. The price for one ticket is $24 (November 2014). Get out at Av. Dr. Carlos Maria Ramirez, esq. (crossing with) Concordia. Ask somebody on the bus if you are not sure. If you miss it, you'll see yourself driving over the Ruta 1 highway, then just get out at the first next stop. From Concordia crossing, walk right into the side-road next to the bridge. You'll find yourself standing at the highway. Walk up about 200m to the on-ramp. You can use this ramp to hitchhike cars both on the highway and driving onto it. This place is also fine for hitchhiking towards La Paz, Canelones or [[Florida (Uruguay)|Florida]] along Ruta 5. From the on-ramp, well away from the city for about 1km, where Ruta 5 seperates. You will have better luck here as the initial on-ramp is a little busy. \\n\\n'''Option 2'''\\n\\nTake a bus from anywhere of Montevideo with number 163 which will put u on the road 1. Do not get out on the first crossing of the highway, but on second. Ask the driver to tell you where. In Uruguay there are generally very little number of cars as the country is low populated.\\n\\n'''Option 3'''\\n\\nTake bus #127 (Delta del Tigre/Barra Santa Lucía) (U$36) and indicate to the bus driver that you want to get off at Peaje Santa Lucía. The bus runs by the corner of Avenida General Rondeau/Paysandú street. This peaje is the first toll booth on Ruta 1 leading towards Colonia de Sacramento and a great and easy spot to hitchhike out of Montevideo.\\n\\n\\n===East towards [[Atlántida]], [[Maldonado]] (IB), [[Brazil]]===\\n\\nIf you plan to hitchhike east along the ''Interbalnearia'', a good start might be at the Carrasco airport. You can take the local bus #109 to Parque Roosevelt  until the last stop, where the Parque R. begins. It can take you about 30-45min from Centro. You then just follow the road for about 1 km, and you'll situate yourself at a roundabout which marks the beginning of the IB. Behind the roundabout, there's a bus stop with plenty of space to stop cars. However, it might be difficult to hitch from there as the road splits just a few kilometers further and many people don't go far. \\n\\nA quicker (although more expensive) option is to take a bus to peaje Pando (Pando toll booth) from the start of Avenida Italia across the bus terminal Tres Cruces. Ask the locals which bus runs there and tell the driver that you want to get off at peaje Pando (it is the first peaje). The bus costs 64 pesos (March 2015). From the toll \\nbooth it is quite easy to hitchhike. This option has the advantage that you start a bit further outside of Montevideo and are already behind the airport and the split of the road. \\n\\n\\n===East towards [[Minas]], [[Treinta y Tres]] (Ruta 8), [[Brazil]]===\\n\\nIf hitchhiking out towards Brazil, one can either take the IB along the coast or the Ruta 8, depending on the destination. Hitchhiking out of Montevideo towards Ruta 8, one can take the local bus #D8 to CNO Maldonado. Get out at Ruta 8, Gral J.A. Lavalleja y Angel Zanelli. If in doubt, ask the driver to leave you close to Villa Garcia. There's a roundabout located, after which it is possible to hitchhike out of town towards Pando, Minas along Ruta 8.\\n\\n\\n== Hitching In ==\\n\\n\\n=== From the airport ===\\n\\nIt's possible to get a ride to Montevideo from the airport by just talking to some friendly looking people. The airport is situated in the north east of Montevideo. Also, if you walk down the parking, there's a barrier for all in- and outgoing traffic that has to pay a fee for entering the airport territory. Behind this barrier, there's plenty of space to communicate with drivers and stop cars. Be aware that traffic can go in all directions at the roundabout just behind it. A bit further up the on-ramp, there's a bus stop as well.\\n\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n{{Cities Uruguay}}\\n{{IsIn|Uruguay}}\\n[[Category:Uruguay]]\\n__NOTOC__\",\n",

If you are in the Old Town (Old Bridge Area), a way to walk out of the city is to follow Tito Street (\\'\\'Maršala Tita\\'\\') and then turn left into \\'\\'Novi put\\'\\' at the first crossing after the cemetery. You will see a signpost showing the directions for [[Sarajevo]] and [[Dubrovnik]]. Continue walking along this road for several kilometres until you reach the sign marking the city limits (the text \"Mostar\" with a line drawn through it). It can be difficult for cars to stop here, but eventually you should get lucky.\\n\\nAnother option might be taking a taxi to \\'\\'Buna\\'\\', the next village. It\\'s only about 5 KM and there is a perfect hitchhiking spot right at the main road.\\n\\n2. The second option involves less walking, just follow Tito St. and turn left after the cemetery as described above, but once you\\'re on the main road you will see a petrol station right after you turn right towards Dubrovnik. You can just hitch in front of the petrol station, there is a long and wide shoulder and you can catch all the transit traffic too. \\n\\nPlease note, most traffic going to Neum will enter Croatia and then renter Bosnia. So you will need a passport that can enter the European Union in order to visit.\\n\\n=== Southeast towards [[Split]], [[Imotski]] (Croatia) (M6.1) ===\\nFrom Gimnazija (the big orange building) follow the road past old bank/sniper tower, continue straight accross the roundabout. When you reach a larger road with traffic lights, turn left. Follow this road til you get to a crossroads at the edge of the city. The road straight ahead is the M6.1 and will take you to Croatia. The road immedietly climbs into the mountains, however, there is a small space for cars to pull over ten meters or so after the traffic lights. \\n\\n=== Northeast towards [[Sarajevo]] {{E|73}} ===\\nFrom the city center walk north on Maršala Tita until you reach the E73. Walk a little bit further on the main road until you reach the Gazprom petrol station. There is a lot of traffic and cars have enough space to pull over.\\n\\n* [[User:Danewithoutborders|Danewithoutborders]] (July 2019) The road you walk on to the Gazprom petrol station is quite trafficked, and it is not comfortable walking on the site of it. Consider a taxi to the petrol station, which isn\\'t expensive in Bosnia. \\n\\nIt is also possible to walk up to the E73 straight away and start hitchhiking from there (if you\\'re staying in the south of the city for example). There is however less space for cars to stop and you miss all traffic coming from Mostar itself.\\n\\n* [[User:Antonopa|Antonopa]] (May 2016) Just at the edge of town there is a patch of wasteland where there are buses parked, just before the road curves off and out of the city. This spot was perfect, I set up there with a sign for Sarajevo, by a lamp post. There is ample space for cars to stop. I waited 25 mins before two guys drove me to Jablinica. Then from Jablinica I took another ride up the road out of town, and from there a truck took me all the way to Sarajevo. This route is very hitchable, although it may take several stages as many people aren\\'t going too far.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking In ==\\nMostar is a small city, you can walk everywhere. Helpful spots to be dropped off at are Musala Trg (In English, Musala Square) or Mepas Mall. Many drivers will be happy to drive you to your destination in the city. \\n\\n== Sleeping ==\\n\\'\\'\\'Update October 2015:\\'\\'\\': The building was closed by the government, all entries are walled. But it is very easy to climb over the walls, as many of the local kids do.\\n \\'\\'\\'update of March 2020:\\'\\'\\' We went to the building as it is in the description, it is effectively closed, but there is an entrance in the back which allows you to go up and sleep on any floor, the two nights we were there, the 7th floor the best\\n\\nMostar has one of the coolest urban sleeping spots in the Balkans -- the abandoned, war-damaged bank. There is seven floors and the roof top terrace to choose from -- it can be a little bit windy, but it might be worth moving away from the staircase as quite a lot of people come up to enjoy the splendid view over the city.df\\n\\n{{IsIn|Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\\n[[Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\\n[[Category:E73]]\\n[[trash:Mostar]]',\n",

Take the north-west exit from the station (front-left if you go from the city centre). On your right you will see a two-lane road going out of a tunnel. This is the [https://goo.gl/maps/obkGF7RQtstNRbrJ6| spot]. You can get there crossing the bushes on its right side. Beware of the ants. The cars are fast there but can easily stop, because only one lane is open for cars, which makes the second a perfect place to stop.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\' \\n\\nTake the Subway 6 to Studentenstadt.  From there walk about 300 m north on Ungererstraße until you are under a bridge.  You will see signs for the motorways.  This leads directly to the A9 highway, a quick and easy route to Berlin or Nürnberg.  For i.e. Cologne it is best to stop at the Rasthof Nürnberg/Feucht as the freeways converge here. To continue on A93, i.e. Regensburg and Dresden you can change the car at Rasthof Fürholzen some 30km north of Munich.\\n\\nThe disadvantage of this option is that there is little room for cars to stop and if there\\'s traffic behind, drivers likely hesitate to stop. \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3\\'\\'\\' Raststätte Fürholzen rest stop\\n\\nTake the S1 to Eching. Follow the road next to the station in the same direction of travel (north-east) as the train you leave. Walk under the autobahn bridge, once you are at first the crossing over the S Bahn take the bike path, it will turn a bit. You will go over another bridge and then need to head to Fürholzen. Once in the town, walk through it until you take Günzenhauser Straße to your left. Follow the road around to the right and you will see the Autobahn. Raststätte Fürholzen is then in front of you. Be sure to study the map in advance and take note that it\\'s a 5–6 km walk. The spot is great.\\n\\n\\nAlternative way: take the S1 to Eching. Pass under the railway to the side where the trains head back towards Munich City and walk the bike path along the railway in the direction you arrived by train until you reach the first bridge that goes over the railway around 100 m. Shortly before the bridge, turn left to reach the road coming down from the bridge Paul-Käsmeier-Straße. At this crossing you can hitchhike easily to the next town Günzenhausen and walk towards Fürholzen. This road will pass under the motorway. A few meters later you\\'ll find a small road to the petrol station Fürholzen Ost\\n\\n=== Southeast towards [[Salzburg]], [[Vienna]], [[Innsbruck]], [[Italy]] {{Autobahn|8}} ===\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\' Ramersdorf bus stop\\n\\nThe A8 highway begins inside the town. A few hundred meters before the beginning, there is a bus stop called Ramersdorf, so enough place to stop. Take a subway to Karl-Preis-Platz or just walk from the town centre along Rosenheimer Straße. Walk past both petrol stations on Rosenheimer Strasse and 10 minutes after the aral you will see a bus stop with a park next to it. If you arrive late after dark, the park is good to sleep in.This is far from an ideal spot, as it\\'s very difficult to catch the attention of the drivers in this spot, and there is too much urban traffic and buses. If you do choose this spot, make sure you have a very visible sign. It\\'s possible to put Rosenheim on a sign (and look for cars with the licence plate RO), which is the next city along the motorway. Close to Rosenheim, there is a huge service area Irschenberg, where you will surely get a ride to Austria.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\' Rosenheimer Straße petrol stations\\n\\nThe easiest way to get out towards Rosenheim is to get the U-bahn/S-bahn to Ostbahnhof. From there, turn left onto Orleansstraße. Keep walking until you get to Rosenheimer Straße. Take a left when you reach it. About 500 m on the right-hand side is a Shell petrol station. There is also a bigger Aral petrol station another 300 m further on the same road. This is probably the best option for getting a hitch. There are also a good couple of places for cars to pull in before and after this petrol station so if the through-flow is bad you can always try this.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3\\'\\'\\' Rosenheimer bus station\\n\\nWalk straight after seeing bus station Rosenheimer Straße pass the street, pass the huge sign A92 and stay at the end of the fence and when any car stop just him to drop you at Rosenheim service station or if you want to go to Balkan make sure that you get out before A10 in Austria. Little bit further at the left, there is a petrol station, it s not a really good place as the road is turning at that place, but at least cars can stop, and it seems to me as the best place there.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 4\\'\\'\\' Raststätte Holzkirchen \\n\\n30 min on S3 train till Holzkitchen than walk to Foching town find a Schmiedstrase turn left walk till concrete rouds end / cross.  Petrol station is on the right. Around 5 km walk\\n\\n\\nAlternative way: 30 min on S3 train till Otterfing. Walk in the same direction your train was going for 200 meters then turn left over the bridge. Follow this road (Kreuzstrasse) for 2.5 km through fields and a forest until you reach the Autobahn. Turn right just before the road goes under the autobahn. Follow this road past the solar panels until the entrance of another tunnel under the autobahn, from here you should be able to see the petrol station ahead.  Cut through the field to reach it (you don\\'t need to jump any fences, to enter walk around the fence, to exit use the gap where the fence changes design). Around 5 km walk\\n\\n=== South towards [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]] {{Autobahn|95}} ===\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nA really good spot to hitchkike in this direction is the petrol station near Machtlfinger Straße. Take the U3 direction Fürstenried West to Machtlfinger Straße. Get out of the station on the side towards Machtlfinger Straße where there are the escalators. Turn right on Machtlfinger straße and then left on Boschetsriederstraße. Follow it for a few hundred meters and you will see the petrol station on the right side. You can also take the bus 51 direction Moosach to Drygalski-Allee, the petrol station is 20meters behind it. A 95 is not the only direction from this station but many people will go there. The toilet is for free and even gendered. \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nYou can also start your hitchhike is on Fürstenrieder Straße. There is a bus stop 200 metres after the crossways Würmtalstraße-Fürstenriederstraße. Cars can easily stop there. Use a sign (A 95, or Garmisch). In the evenings you can try to get a lift at the traffic light at the crossways.\\n\\n=== Southwest towards [[Landsberg]], [[Memmingen]], [[Lindau]], [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]] (Vorarlberg), [[Italy]] {{Autobahn|96}} ===\\n\\nFirst service station on the A96 is the Rasthof Lechwiesen close to Landsberg, you can change cars here to go further. \\n\\nIf you want to travel to any city on the Lake Constance (Bodensee), look out for Swiss and Austrian cars as they all have to pass Lindau where they can come off the highway to drop you off and get back on it again easily - and this only takes them 2 minutes out of their way. Ask to be dropped off at the last exit (Exit 2, Lindau) before the border to Austria, there is a roundabout close to a petrol station and McD that works well in any direction.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nThe A96 begins inside of Munich. Close to the on-ramps of the motorway there is a petrol station Aral on Garmischer Straße that is frequented by many people before they go onto the motorway.  From Heimeranplatz bus line 63, direction Forstenrieder Allee. Exit at stop Garmischer strasse and walk for few minutes..\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nTake the S-Bahn number 8 (S8) to Neugilching, and walk on the main road Landsberger Straße in the same direction where the train is going, in 800 meter you will see a petrol station to your right and Make Death (MC), there you can ask people for a lift for your direction or just for the petrol station in Landsberg, where are more cars stopping.\\nAlso you can hitch from the ramp to the direction of Lindau, I waited there few minutes.\\n\\n=== West towards [[Augsburg]], [[Ulm]], [[Stuttgart]] {{Autobahn|8}} {{European Route Number|52}} ===\\n\\nFrom the central railway station Hauptbahnhof, take tram S2 towards Petershausen. Get out at Obermenzing. There along the street you can either walk the 2-3 km towards the motorway, or take bus #143 4 stops to Blutenburg stop. \\n\\nThe bus #143 stop is across the road from the S2 exit. If the bus is not leaving for a while, you can easily hitchhike at the traffic lights nearby. I would advise putting Augsburg on the sign. There is a service station, Rasthof Augsburg, just before this town. \\n\\nThis stop is located directly in front of a roundabout, and KFC where the A8 highway for direction west starts. There\\'s enough place for cars to stop in front of the roundabout. Expect high traffic. For the petrol-station-lover, some meters before a small petrol station is located, so if you\\'re bored, go asking people there. Make sure to carry a sign where you want to go as the motorway will split after 2 km towards different directions. \\n\\nThis is also a great way to get to Frankfurt as you can hitch to Ulm, north to Würzburg and then west to Frankfurt.\\n\\n=== North and South {{Autobahn|99}} ===\\n[[File:Vaterstetten.jpeg|right|thumb|334px|Rasthof Vaterstetten Ost seems like a pretty popular spot.]]\\n\\nThe A99 is the Munich ring road (http://www.autobahnatlas-online.de/A99.htm). While not as accurate as other south south/north bound jumping off points, the service station Rasthof Vaterstetten Ost is a good point if seeking to get lifts from long-distance lorry drivers, many of whom stay overnight here. This service station is located at the A99 in Feldkirchen. It is located only 2 km from the S-Bahn station Vaterstetten and requires walking through the small village to the back of the service station. 1,000 trucks or more park here here every night with many more passing through, heading north and south. While I would not like to sleep here (with a 1,000 plus lonely men), its a excellent place when heading both north and south. Make sure to carry a sign indicating what motorway who are hoping to take. For example, the A8 to the the South and East or the A94 to Passau. If you come at night or sunday (or any other time, if you\\'re a daredevil), then you could check out the container of a bio supermarket which is on the way.\\n\\n== Sleeping & Eating ==\\n=== Airport \"Franz-Josef-Strauss\" ===\\nMaybe not the most comfortable place to sleep, but always open and not busy at night is the airport Franz-Josef-Strauss at A92 (from Regensburg). Hitchhiking away from there late in the evening is a pain, but if you end up there, you can count on a dry and warm night. There is no waiting hall (there are no flights at night) but enough restaurants where you can pick your bench and toilets are open any time.\\n\\n=== Main Train Station ===\\nLocated in the center and always open is the Munich main train station. If you get stuck in the city, this is probably a better solution than the airport which unfortunately is pretty far outside of Munich, but don\\'t expect it to be more comfortable. There is a small waiting hall on the mezzanine level and a few benches on the platforms. It is common to find some people resting on the first floor of the main entrance hall (right next to Burger King) and tolerated by the Deutsche Bahn security guards as long as you don\\'t intend to crash there for more than a single night. If asked, just tell them you wait for a train that leaves early in the morning and they usually leave you alone. You can sneak into the toilets of the two Burger King restaurants around (free, but closed from about 3:30am), or use the toilets of the main train station (50ct minimum). Another advantage over the airport is that it\\'s quite easy to get back to any hitchhiking spot from here.\\n\\n=== Studentenstadt ===\\nIf you want to meet loads of students and really cheap drinks - rare in Munich - come to Studentenstadt (Subway U6 north of the city centre). It\\'s the largest student accomodation in Munich. You might find somebody to host you - without any guarantee. There is a perfect place for camping, about 5 mins from Studentenstadt station - in the English Gardens. Try to pitch your tent at night time, after all you are in Bavaria.\\n\\n=== Stattpark Olga ===\\nIt\\'s a wagenburg (place where people live in their campervans). Usually they are open for travellers and they have guest van for sleeping, but come to this place not so late and firstly meet with a people. They also have a lot of place where you can put a tent. You can find there freeshop with books and clothes. The collective of this place organise some meetings, shows, etc.  [http://olga089.blogsport.de/ \"Stattpark OLGA\", Boschetsrieder Straße 109]\\n\\n=== Kafe Marat ===\\nIf you arrive on Friday you can get really good, cheap and vegan dinner in the [http://kafemarat.blogsport.de/englisch Kafe Marat, Thalkirchener Straße 102] (maybe also on wednesdays?). It\\'s a self-organized, more left wing place. Drinks are also really cheap there. Food normally is ready at around 20:30.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n{{hitchbase_city|46}}\\n__NOTOC__\\n\\n\\n[[Category:Bavaria|Bavaria]]\\n[[Category:Germany]]\\n[[Category:E45]]\\n[[Category:E52]]\\n[[Category:E53]]\\n[[Category:E54]]\\n\\n[[de:München]]',\n",

In 2004, Münster won the [http://www.muenster.de/stadt/umweltamt/livcom/livcom2004_320.avi LivCom-Award] for the most livable city in the world with a population between 200,000 and 750,000.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== West towards [[Steinfurt]], [[Gronau]], [[Enschede]] ([[Netherlands]]) ===\\nFind a suitable place to stand along ''Steinfurter Straße'' {{Bde|54}}. This is the road leading out of town to the north-west. There is a petrol station on the road, but a better option seems to be simply walking along the road itself with a sign saying ''NL'', and seeing what happens. To get here, take bus #16 and get out at ''Eissporthalle'' or walk from the city center (~25min).\\nGet a ride at least as far as [[Steinfurt]]. There's a good petrol station there where you can find rides to take you the rest of the way.{{Coords|52.1589|7.3195}}\\n\\n=== North towards [[Greven]], [[Emsdetten]] ===\\nTake the ''Regiobus'' #R51 or ''Stadtbus'' number 16 to direction Sprakel. Get out at ''Am-Max-Klemens-Kanal''. There along the ''Sprakeler Strasse''  you will find a restaurant and a railway crossing. In front of the railway crossing (or on the parking area of the restaurant) is lots of space to stop cars that go north to [[Greven]]. You can also walk up the ''Grevener Straße'', coming from the ring-road, and hitch at any of the bus stops along the way.\\n\\n=== North, South towards [[Osnabrück]], [[Hamburg]], [[Ruhr Area]] {{Autobahn|1}} ===\\nIf you want to travel along the {{Ade|1}}, take the ''Stadtbus'' #1 (sometimes doesn't run very often, eg. on Sundays) towards ''Roxel Hallenbad'' and get out at the ''Dorffeldstrasse''. When you started from the central station, the bus will ride around 30 minutes. This costs you EUR 2. At the ''Dorffeldstrasse'', walk down the road towards the ''Nottulner Landweg'', go left and after around 100 meter go right into the street ''Am Rohrbusch''. Walk towards the bend to the left, but go straight into the little way (you'll find a dead-end street sign), and after some 20 meters you see a way going to the left ending directly on the service station ''Münsterland''. {{Coords|51.9474|7.5506}} Yey, you are there for going south! If you want to go north, just don't go into the dead-end street but walk left, cross the bridge and walk to the right just behind the bridge. After 500m you'll also be on the petrol station towards the north.\\n\\n== Hitching In ==\\nIf you come from the motorway {{Ade|1}}, get off at the service station ''Münsterland''. There you find some delivery roads that bring you off the motorway near the village of ''Roxel''. Coming from the south, it's very easy. Walk down the delivery road for 1 km, then at the crossing go straight forward until a car seller. There walk left and you find a traffic light with enough space to stop cars (see map). Most traffic here goes towards the city center (~6 km). Coming from the north, walk the delivery road there until the road and go right over the bridge. Then after the bridge to the left and you'll find the car seller after some 500 meter.\\n \\n== Free Internet ==\\nis available on 2 computers at Gleis22.

For directions on how to hitch to a specific city or spot, hit the link to your destination or use the interactive map.\\n\\n== General ==\\n\\nThe southern region of [[Israel]], largely consisting of a desert, is called '''the Negev''' in Hebrew or '''an-naqab''' in Arabic. It is very common to hitchhike in the Negev, and it hosts some popular hitchhiking destinations.\\n\\nThe tourist city of [[Eilat]] is located on the [[Red Sea]] at the Negev's southern tip. The village of [[Mitzpe Ramon]] is located at the heart of the Negev, overviewing the largest natural creator in the world. The southernmost part of the [[Dead Sea]] is located in the northeastern part of the region. The city of [[Beer Sheva]] is the largest community in the region, dubbed ''the capital of the Negev''.\\n\\nFrom the Negev, it is also common to hitchhike out of Israel, either to [[Egypt]] through [[Taba pass]], or to [[Jordan]] through [[Aqaba pass]]. Both border passes are located near Eilat, at the southern tip of the Negev.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking in the Negev ==\\n\\nHitchhiking in the Negev is both common and simple. As the area is sparsely populated, you can just head out to the end of a city or a village and thumb your way right from the highway. In smaller communities, such as the Kibbutzim of the Negev, where public transport is less frequent, it is quite common for locals to hitchhike from the entrance of their dominion.\\n\\nWhen hitchhiking in the Negev, the two most important things to remember are that it is a desert that is located in a militarized area of Israel. There are many ways locals and travelers keep themselves cool in the reality of the desert, and you should consider all of them.\\n\\nIn the Negev, especially in the summer months (between June and September), an average day in the sun can easily reach 40-42 degrees centigrade. To deal with the beating desert sun, it is recommended to hitchhike from covered spots like a bus station, a [[Trempiyada]], or a gas station. Alternatively, you can try and avoid the hottest hours, which are between 11 and 15. Always hitchhike with a bottle of water, keep yourself hydrated, wear a hat and apply sunscreen if needed.\\n\\nYou should also stay alert in the Negev for closed military areas (more common in the West of the region) and areas of the desert that still has unexploded mines dating back to Israel's wars with Egypt, and others that function as drilling sites for Israeli Defence Forces units. These are not found on the Negev's highways, which are the easiest routes to hitchhike in the area.\\n\\n== Highways ==\\n\\nIsrael's two largest vertical highways, routes 40 and 90, pass throughout the region. [[Israel's Route 40]] cuts through the Negev in its center, starting from the Beduin city of [[Rahat]], going through Beer-Sheva and Mitzpe, and ending in Eilat.  [[Israel's route 90]], perhaps the most famous of the roads in the area, as it is a straight highway that starts on Israel's border with [[Lebanon]], passing through the [[West Bank]] of the Jordan river, and reaches the Negev in the Dead Sea before continuing through various ecological Kibutzs until it ends up in Eilat.\\n\\nWhile both of these roads are considered national highways, their hitchhiking spots are very easily reached by public transportation or even on foot. It is most efficient to try and hitchhike from bus stops and [[Trempiyada|Trempiyadas]] along the way, and there are also gas stations that can function as a hitchhiking spot and also double as a place to take cover from the heat.\\n\\n[[Category:Israel]]\\n\\n[[He:נגב]]\",\n",

The town is sprawled out, with approximately 2.5 miles between each of the three onramps. The northernmost onramp is less traveled and probably the most useless to any hitchhiker as there's not much around. The middle onramp is closest to the center of town (1.5 miles) and heavily used by locals. The southernmost offramp is my favorite, complete with hotels, 3 gas stations, a Burger King and (of course) a Flying J truck stop. Both north and south ramps are wide and hitchhiker friendly, plus they both connect to highway 28 should you be trying to get to Salina and I-70 as this hitchhiker is (I had originally planned to take I-15 further south to Scipio and catch highway 50, but realized that would be a little bit of a hike to the other side of town and a local pointed out that 28 goes to Gunnison and eventually Salina. Of course, a room at the 6 Motel equally changed my mind). For reference, the Safari Inn located in town is noted for frequent police calls.

So remember: While hitching in NJ you have four options: \\n\\n* Every time you see a white car, drop the thumb and start walking (and fast).\\n* Get a ride through the whole state.\\n* NJ Transit to the state line ([[Pennsylvania|PA]] has more favorable laws)\\n\\n== Experiences / Advice==\\nI have been all around Central and South Jersey.

I would strongly recommend hitchhiking in the state of New Jersey unless you are absolutely willing to get picked up by a cop and taken to a bus station/train station.\\n\\n\\n== Hitching Out ==\\nIf you do choose to hitchhike west out of New Jersey, the best option is try to hitch onto I-80 West from Mt.

Generally, when travellers say they are from or going toward \"New York\", they are referring to this city, which is made up of five boroughs: Manhattan (an island), Brooklyn, Queens (both located on the western end of Long Island), Staten Island, and The Bronx (on the North American mainland).\\n\\nHitchhiking is \\'\\'\\'illegal\\'\\'\\' in New York City as well as in the neighboring state of New Jersey; enforcement varies see https://hitchwiki.org/en/New_York_State\\n\\n\\n== Hitchhiking Out==\\n\\n\\n=== Heading North (I-87, toward [[Albany (New York)|Albany]], upstate New York, and [[Montreal]]) ===\\n\\nAdvice: Don\\'t get stuck in Albany. There is a fairly large service area (New Baltimore Travel Plaza) on the Thruway just before Albany, so getting off there is preferable (technically illegal to hitch on a rest area connected to the Thruway, but you can ask around).\\n\\nAsk the rides in EV Connect Charging Station petrol station / rest stop on I-287 highway next to Rte 119 & White Plains Rd bus stop.\\n\\nRide the subway to Fordham Rd on the B/D, where if you have a Metrocard you can transfer for free from the subway to the Bee-Line #61 bus which runs to the suburb of Rye (and beyond).  From Rye you can start hitching on the onramp to I-287. \\n\\nRide the subway to Woodlawn in the northern Bronx, last stop on the 4 train, and hitch at the ramps just north of there where Jerome Ave joins I-87.  You\\'re still within New York City so hitchhiking is technically illegal but this far out enforcement seems lax.  There\\'s also a Dunkin\\' Donuts and a gas station nearby where you can ask around for rides up I-87 or the partially-parallel Taconic State Parkway.\\n\\n\\n=== Heading Northeast (I-95, toward [[New Haven]], [[Providence]], and [[Boston]]) ===\\n\\nEV Connect Charging Station petrol station / rest stop on I-287 highway next to Rte 119 & White Plains Rd bus stop.

She recommends this route for hitchhiking North, especially if you don\\'t want to spend a lot of money getting out of the city or time waiting outside. In Noroton Heights [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&time=&date=&ttype=&q=325+Heights+Rd,+Darien,+CT+06820&sll=41.224118,-72.559204&sspn=1.875734,4.279175&ie=UTF8&ll=41.069322,-73.492999&spn=0.007344,0.016716&z=16&om=1 there is an on-ramp about 1km from the train station]. There is a steady flow of cars who mostly have to stop before entering the on-ramp, and the area is suitable for low-key camping out. A local police patrol car passed her while she stood with her thumb out but did not harass her. (Whereas, if you take the Metro-North train from Grand Central Station in Midtown Manhattan, you\\'ll pay more than double for the ticket, plus the $2.75 subway fare to get to the station. So, if you\\'re already on the subway, you might as well get the most of your $2.75 (or free swipe, see below) and take it as far out as possible.) [[User:Zenit|Zenit]] followed these instructions in July 2010 and highly recommends them as well. Also on the train his ticket was never checked. Got a ride within 5-10 minutes at night using this around May 2018. \\n\\nTaking the \"B\" or \"D\" subway to Fordham, and walking the six blocks south (\"right\") on Fordham Rd to Metro North.  This requires less walking, and the New Haven Line trains stop here more frequently on their way north.  Fares from Fordham to Noroton Heights are the same as from Mount Vernon East, and it is much easier/quicker to access.\\n\\nHitching along Bruckner Blvd near Brook Ave in the Bronx, reachable via the 6 subway train.  (This section of Bruckner Blvd is used heavily by cars trying to get from Manhattan to the northeast-bound Bruckner Expressway without paying a toll.)  Drivers may be less likely to stop in such urban surroundings, and you should exercise caution as the levels of both crime and police presence in this neighborhood are relatively high, but this is \\nat least one option that does not require a commuter train.\\n\\n[[File:GWBplaza.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Cars waiting for hitchhikers to take across the GWB]]\\n\\nThere is a bus stop at the New Jersey end of the George Washington Bridge (below Lemoine Ave) where drivers pick up passengers to try to qualify for the carpool discount on the bridge toll, and hitchhiking at this location is [http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2012/06/21/chris-christie-reportedly-asks-police-to-quit-ticketing-gw-bridge-carpoolers/ reportedly considered legal].  The vast majority of drivers will just be crossing the bridge to reach Manhattan, but as this is the main freeway route for traffic from the south crossing New York City towards Connecticut and beyond, looking for longer rides here may be worth a shot.  It\\'s about a 3km walk from 175 St on the A subway train to the New Jersey end of the bridge.\\n\\nIf heading towards [[Vermont]], take the Metro North all the way to Danbury, CT (Change in E. Norwalk).  The fare is $8 from Mount Vernon East ($9 from Fordham).  This puts one right on Rt 7, which winds through the hills of Massachusetts and Vermont all the way to the Canadian border. \\n\\n\\n=== Heading West (I-80) ===\\n\\nIf you are trying to get to [[Pennsylvania]] or points West, your best bet is to take NJ Transit to [[Mt. Olive]], [[New Jersey]] ($14.75 from New York Penn Station, or $9 (plus $2.75 for PATH) if you take PATH to Newark, walk to Broad St Station and catch NJT there). This will get you out of the suburbs, and thus increase the likelihood of getting a long-distance ride. From the Mt. Olive train station, you can walk to the [[on-ramp]] of I-80. Be advised that hitchhiking is illegal just about everywhere in New Jersey, including shoulders and on-ramps, so use caution.\\n\\nIt may also be possible to get a ride from the westbound Lemoine Ave bus stop at the end of the GWB (opposite the eastbound one described under \"Northeast\" above).\\n\\n\\n=== Heading West/Southwest (I-78) ===\\n\\nInterstate I-78 is a road that more or less comes from NYC, passes through New Jersey and leads towards Harrisburg.\\nSince New Jersey might be a little bit tricky and hitchhiking is kind of outlawed there, it might be best to take a bus ride.  For $25.80 you can get to [[Allentown]] in [[Pennsylvania]], hence bypassing New Jersey.\\nThe bus leaves New York at the Port Authority bus terminal. In Allentown you can walk or hitchhike (within the city) to the entrance of the I-78.  (Of course, if you can book in advance then for that price you can get a Megabus all the way to Pittsburgh or beyond.) You can also take the Bieber Bus for about $27 to one of several towns (Hellertown, Wescosville) along the highway and thus avoid the long walk from the Allentown bus terminal to the highway. You may need to buy your ticket online in advance. If you do take the Bieber bus to Wescosville, don\\'t bother with the Wescosville travel plaza if you\\'re headed west - i know it looks promising but all traffic out of there is headed south to philadelphia. Ask at gas stations or thumb it on the ramps.\\n\\nAnother option is to take a NJ Transit train to [[Annandale]] ($15 from Penn Station, $11 from Newark) and hitch the on-ramp.\\n\\n\\n=== Heading Southwest (I-95, toward [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and [[Washington D.C.]]) ===\\n\\nAsk the rides in Thomas Edison Service Area on Highway I-95. Thats next the Woodbridge train station\\n\\n\\n== Subway ==\\n\\nYou\\'re likely to need a subway ride at the start of any attempt to hitchhike out of NYC (and probably to get around while there as well).  Many subway riders have unlimited-ride Metrocards, and since a card is only required to enter the subway system (not to exit), it\\'s possible to get people with unlimited-ride cards who are leaving the system to swipe you in for free (as there is no additional cost to them).  At busier stations, just stand outside the turnstiles and politely ask exiting riders if they\\'ll swipe you in. It\\'s also possible to swipe in for free by waiting in the emergency door and ask someone from the other side to open it. Many people use the emergency door to jump in for free, specially families with kids, only the parents have card and once they are inside they open the emergency door for their children.  See [http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/01/free_swipe.php this article] for a discussion of the \"free swipes\" phenomenon.\\n\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|New York State}}\\n\\n[[Category:New York]]\\n[[Category:United States]]\\n[[Category:Illegal to hitchhike]]',\n",

The main access roads to the city are the A69 and the A1(M).\\n\\n== Heading West ([[Carlisle]], M6, A74(M))==\\nTake the 39 or 40 bus to ''Leamington Road Ends'' (Exit junction from A69 near the start. Walk down to the other side of the junction and onto the A69. The filter lane is very long and is never busy. The traffic on the A69 is usually not going too fast; this is an excellent spot for cars to pull over. Consider waiting for a ride all the way to Carlisle, as it can occasionally be complicated hitching on the A69 Itself.\\n\\nBus stop ''Denton Burn, West Road-The Ramparts'' works as well. Take bus 10 or 11 from the Central Station. One of these buses stops right there, the other one turns right two crossings earlier (West Rd/Slatyford Ln, there is a pedestrian brigde over the street). From there, you have to get back on West Road and continue walking west. You'll find the bus stop about 800ft/250m behind the big intersection.\\n\\n== South toward [[Leeds]], [[Manchester]], [[London]]... A1(M) ==\\nCatch the bus 21 or 22 (heading Gateshead) until the stop ''Durham road - Harlow Green Infants'' which is just in front of a petrol station.\\nYou can as well catch the 1 or the 2 and get off at Allerdene (ask maybe to be the closer than Durham road) and then get up the bridge which is Durham road, and where you will see the petrol station.\\nIt could seem like there are not a lot of people, but just ask for the next services 5 miles down the road toward the A1, there are a lot of cars who go down to the south, and so it's easy to get a long lift. Good luck guys!\\n\\nIf you are going very far South (London etc.) you should consider going to Carlisle and hitching down the [[M6 (GB)|M6]]. The M6 is usually busier than the A1/A1(M), and you are more likely to be left at Service stations, rather than roundabouts and junctions.\\n\\n== North toward [[Edinburgh]]... A1 ==\\nThe only major road north from Newcastle is the A1, which will take you up to Edinburgh via Alnwick and Berwick-upon-Tweed. Author has hitched it a few times, and always been successful though sometimes it can feel a bit like getting there by the skin of your teeth as there aren't loads of great hitching spots up the A1. Friendly locals often take you a short stretch though and you can hop from town to town. To get out of Newcastle, you can take the Metro towards the Airport and get off at Kingston Park. Walk away from the metro stop past tesco for about ten minutes, you get to a small roundabout and then straight away a bigger one leading onto the A1. You can stand on the corner of the roundabout exit- it's a good spot from the point of view of traffic (everyone coming up the A1 and joining it out of Newcastle or Hexham), though not totally ideal in terms of stopping space as people just have to pull over on a sliproad as per usual.\\n[[trash:Newcastle]]\",\n",

Passing the border might scare some people, and it\\'s also true that hitchhiking is not as easy in Italy as in France so expect to wait a bit longer.\\n\\n=== West towards [[Marseille]], [[Lyon]], [[Paris]] ===\\n\\nTake a train or the bus No 10 to St Laurent du Var - Gare SNCF. From the station building north of the tracks walk along rue Léonard Anfossi. Soon you will arrive to a roundabout, follow on, pass under the motorway bridge, where you\\'ll see a second roundabout, the exit on your left is the onramp for westbound A8. Use a sign saying [[Cannes]] and get off at the petrol station on the Cannes bypass.\\n\\n=== Both west and East on the [[A8 (France)|A8]] ===\\nThere is a [[péage]] in northwest Nice suitable for both directions. The problem though, is that it\\'s difficult to access. Take the bus no.9 to \\'\\'Nice - La plaine\\'\\' and from there hitch or walk the remaining 2,5 km north along \\'\\'Route de Grenoble\\'\\'. Firstly, the motorway will be parallel to the road on your left, there you\\'ll be able to see the southbound péage but unable to access it. A bit further is a roundabout with an [[on-ramp]] for A8 towards [[Monaco]]/[[Menton]] with a péage a 100 m further. \\nTo get to the southbound péage you\\'ll have to keep north on \\'\\'Route de Grenoble\\'\\' (use the left [[shoulder]]), cross the A8 under the bridge and you will see a southbound on-ramp accessible only to cars coming from the north. Walk back along it till you get to the péage (although that\\'s probably forbidden).\\n\\n=== North towards [[Grenoble]] ===\\nThat\\'s a mountain road, where you can make it to Grenoble in one day or less (in summer). \\nThe first way to get there is the same as for the Péage on the A8, but from the roundabout just hitch towards Digne instead the A8. Other possibility is to take the \"Chemin de Fer de Provence \" train to Bellet, (at least 1 train an hour) there is a good roundabout just next to the station.\\n\\nIf planning to go to the Mercantour National Park, you can take a public transport bus from Route de Grenoble that goes to Saint-Martin-de-Var and costs as the normal ticket. There is a roundabout just at the end of the village.\\n\\nWhen considering hitching in and out of Nice one should keep in mind that the bus company Lignes d\\'Azur operates lines to and from nearby cities (Grasse, Monaco and more) at a price of EUR 1.50 per single ticket (tickets are bought from the driver. prepare the exact sum).\\nThis buses have a LOT of stops and take a long time to reach their final destination but they are frequent and operate on Sundays.\\nYou can find the list of lines [https://www.departement06.fr/vous-deplacer-en-bus/lignes-et-horaires-3029.html here].\\n\\n== Sleeping ==\\n\\nIt is possible to pitch a tent on the beach west from the airport just across the river. A perfect hidden spot where you can find ducks, couples having picnics, kids drinking beer in the evening and some fishermen but they will all leave you alone. It can get crowded in peak season... To get there walk about 2 hours along the beach towards west until you pass the airport and cross the bridge. Go right immediately and walk along the river until it touches the sea. Or take the train to Saint Laurent du Var. There is a huge shopping mall on the beach. Behind it there are big rocks stacked in a wave defence wall. Cross it and enjoy. \\n\\nAnother good option to pitch a tent in the north of Nice, very close to higway A8. On the end of the Boulevard Comte de Falicon you will find a church (last stop of the train Henri Sappia or previous Comte de Falicon). If you stand in front of the church go around from the left side and you will see small ravine between church fence and highway fence with small trees and bushes. It\\'s enough place for a couple of tents and nobody will see you. It\\'s quite noisy because of the road.\\n\\nAnother good spot to sleep, and it’s very Beautiful is the Coco Beach, you will get there when you walk up the Promenade des anglais and then like 15-20 minutes walking up the Hill ( and then down ).\\nThere are many Big Stones with much space and  \\na view which is stunning.\\nBut be careful, on the large stones without „hide“ you only should sleep without tent, But there are many hidden stones for tenting. \\n\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n{{Cities France}}\\n\\n[[Category:France]]\\n[[Category:E80]]\\n[[Category:E74]]\\n\\n[[fr:Nice]]',\n",

Hitching here is fairly easy. There are three so called ''[[liftershalte]]s''.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== North towards [[Arnhem]], [[Apeldoorn]], [[Hengelo]] and [[Groningen]] ===\\n{{Coords|51.845040|5.873448}}<br>\\nAt the verkeersplein near the Waalbrug (direction [[Arnhem]]) there is a liftershalte. this is a hitch-hiking spot as it should be, and you hope it to be. It should be no trouble at all to get to the first gas station on de {{Anl|50}} from where you can easily get to [[Zwolle]] or [[Hengelo]].  Possibly, at the petrol station on the {{Anl|325}} almost everybody is going to Arnhem. \\n\\n=== East towards [[Germany]], [[Kleve]] ===\\n====Option 1====\\n{{Coords|51.8452|5.8749}}<br>\\nNear the official hitchhiking spot leading north, use the bus stop at the sliproad at this junction in the direction of [[Kleve]]. The road is the {{Nnl|325}}, the street is ''Nieuwe Ubbergseweg''. Don't bother walking further along the N325, there are no further good spots until the German border.\\n\\n====Option 2====\\n{{Coords|51.8232|5.7716}}<br>\\nFor further afield in Germany, try the junction with motorway [[A73 (Netherlands)|A73]] in Dukenburg. Okay, it's quite a way out of city centre, and there is little place to safely stop, but this is such a busy entrance, and there are so many cars going long-distance here that it's child's play to get a long ride. Even more so because just before the motorway split between [[A73 (Netherlands)|A73]] and [[A77 (Netherlands)|A77]] is just 15 kilometres south of here, and it has a large service area right before it. So any car going to [[Boxmeer]] or further can pick you up here, and there are many of those. When trying to hitch out towards [[Düsseldorf]], [[Cologne|Köln]] or further, one should use this ramp.\\n\\n=== South / West towards [[Venlo]], [[Eindhoven]], [[Den Bosch]] ===\\n====Option 1====\\n{{Coords|51.8416|5.858}}<br>\\nAt the ''Graafseweg'' (direction [[Venlo]] and [[den Bosch|'s-Hertogenbosch]]) there is a liftershalte (often used as a parking spot), and many cars passing by are local. Better is to walk down to the intersection of Graafseweg and Neerbosscheweg (about 30 min. walk) and raise sign there. About one-fourth of cars passing here are for destinations in [[Brabant]] and [[Limburg]] province, so waiting times are fairly minimal considering the amount of (slow-moving) traffic and the good place to stop. It's also possible to get bus 2 and 99 here.\\n\\n====Option 2====\\n{{Coords|51.8232|5.7716}}<br>\\nAnother spot is there where one should try to get rides to [[Düsseldorf]] or [[Cologne|Köln]] directly at the onramp of [[A73 (Netherlands)|A73]] southbound. It's quite a way out, and there's not a whole lot of space to stop, but the statistics are overwhelmingly in your favour here, at least 50% are going to [[Boxmeer]] or further from here, which means they can drop you off at the [[rest area|service station]] before the [[A73 (Netherlands)|A73]] / [[A77 (Netherlands)|A77]] split. IF you want to take this option, take the bus to ''station Dukenburg'' there are a lot of busses that go there so this should be easy. (If you want to plan your journey to any bus or train station or any location in general use the website 9292.nl This will give a very nicee and clear schedule.) From Station Dukenburg stand with the busstops behind you and the railway to your right and take a right under the tunnel. Take a left at the giant roundabout and from there it is a 10-15 minute walk straight ahead to the onramp. It should take you 20 minutes to get a ride. \\n\\n====Option 3====\\n{{Coords|51.8243|5.7847}}<br>\\nThere is a gas station near the onramp (described at option 2) you can ask people here and/or raise sign a couple of metres before the way to the gasstation so they can easily stop there if they want. If you want to check it out: search for ''Wijchenseweg 1, Nijmegen'' om google maps. It took me around 20 minutes to hitch a ride to Venlo from here. \\n\\n=== West towards [[Rotterdam]], [[Utrecht]], [[Den Haag]] and [[Amsterdam]] ===\\n{{Coords|51.8450|5.8734}} Liftershalte<br>\\n{{Coords|51.8390|5.7982}} Petrol station<br>\\nUse either the [[liftershalte]] near the Waal bridge mentioned in the '''North''' section, or use the petrol station past the ''Neerbosschebrug'' in the ''Lindenholt'' neighbourhood. Take bus 7 for the petrol station, you can see it on your right side if the bus turns into Lindenholt past the bridge. Avoid rides to Arnhem when using the [[liftershalte]], unless it's possible to be dropped off on the right side of Arnhem, if you're familliar with that city. Remember that it's usually much easier to hitch out of Nijmegen than to hitch out of Arnhem, so it doesn't really matter if you turn 3, 4 or 10 rides down.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n{{Cities Netherlands}}\\n{{Cities Gelderland}}\\n\\n[[Category:Gelderland]]\\n\\n[[de:Nijmegen]]\\n[[nl:Nijmegen]]\",\n",

If you look like a hobo your chances decrease further. Look presentable to increase your chance of getting picked up and be friendly. Ask questions.\\n\\nBe careful to check the altitude of the places where you wish to go, and through which you travel. A lot of people might be able get you closer to your destination, but they are not willing to drop you where it is cold (there can be freezing temperatures even in the summer).\\n\\n== Regions & Cities ==\\n__TOC__\\n=== In the North ===\\n* [[Alta]]\\n* [[Kautokeino]]\\n* [[Lofoten]], an archipelago\\n* [[Narvik]]\\n* [[Nordkapp]], the Northernmost point of [[Europe]]\\n* [[Svalbard and Jan Mayen Islands]]\\n* [[Trofors]]\\n* [[Tromsø]]\\n* [[Bodø]]\\n\\n=== Other Cities ===\\n* [[Oslo]]\\n* [[Bergen]]\\n* [[Fredrikstad]]\\n* [[Horten]]\\n* [[Kristiansand]]\\n* [[Skien]]\\n* [[Stavanger]]\\n* [[Trondheim]]\\n* [[Voss]]\\n* [[Otta]]\\n\\n=== License plates ===\\nThere is a coding for areas: the two first letters identify the region in which the vehicle is first registered, but as the plates migrate with the vehicle and Norwegians travel pretty much all around the country, it\\'s not something hitchhikers rely on.\\nSee also [[:wikipedia:Vehicle registration plates of Norway#Prefixes_and_sequence_numbers|List of codes on Wikipedia]]\\n\\nVehicles with Norwegian \\'\\'\\'green license plates do not have back seats\\'\\'\\'. So if you are not traveling alone, hitching a ride with such a vehicle is of little use. Some vans have a double bench for passengers in front, but except for those, green plates means seating for one passenger only. Even if it is a vehicle that had back seats when it left the factory, they will have been removed upon importation to Norway. This is done for tax reasons. Vehicles affected by this include \\'\\'\\'almost all pick-up trucks \\'\\'including\\'\\' 4-door models\\'\\'\\', and some minivans and SUVs. Also some old station wagons.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking culture ==\\n\\n[[File:2002 hitch hiking in Norway.jpg|thumb|280px|right|[[User:Sigurdas|Sigurdas]] hitch-hiking somewhere in the middle of Norway. January 2002.]]\\n\\'\\'\\'Norway\\'\\'\\' has a mixed reputation for hitchiking, some people will try and convince you Norway is hitchhikers hell. Others will say it is a paradise. While the truth lies somewhere in between, hitchiking definitely works, so don\\'t let the naysayers put you off (but equally don\\'t get cockey and expect 10 second wait times).\\n\\n=== Positive ===\\n\\'\\'\\'Norway\\'\\'\\' is not an easy country to hitch in, but it can be rewarding! Even though \\'\\'haike\\'\\' is not too common in Norway, people are very likely to pick you up and can be very friendly and helpful.  Like in Sweden, foreign tourists and immigrants are more likely to [[picking up hitchhikers|pick up hitchhikers]].\\n\\nAccording to [[User:Francisco1|Francisco1]] (also said by  [[User:Fede|Fede]] [[User:Earlyturtle|Earlyturtle]]) although he didn\\'t look very Norwegian and had no flag (see here below), just common nice cardboard signs, he always found people, many times locals (some foreigners also), any gender, any age, to pick him up, help him and give good advice. He doesn\\'t agree with the idea that most Norwegians are unwelcoming to strangers, and even less nationalist or racist. \\n\\nAccording to Capy, hitchhiking in Norway was easy. They were getting picked up by Norwegians and foreigners alike.\\n\\n\\'\\'(see also: [[Talk:Norway|Norway, a paradise for hitchhikers]])\\'\\'\\n\\n=== Negative ===\\nAccording to [[User:thomasmyrman|thomasmyrman]] who hitched with a huge Norwegian flag, many drivers said they only stopped because it made them feel nationalistic pride and that it made the hitcher visible from far away. Consider having at least a small flag (even if you are not Norwegian) which you can buy anywhere in Norway. [[User:Grata|Grata]] also had a bad experience.\\n\\n\\'\\'(see also: [[Talk:Norway|No, it is not easy to hitchhike in Norway]])\\'\\'\\n\\n=== Hitching ferries ===\\n\\nAs of summer 2024, almost all normal car ferries are free of passengers and pedestrians, you just pay for the car, some are even free for the cars! I hitchiked from oslo to norkapp, took many ferries, including the long distance bodo to lofoten islands ferry, and all of them where free. \\n\\nSometimes your driver will ask you to get out of the car and walk onto the ferry separately, \"just in case\". If this happens be super careful, as the second the last car is on the ferry it leaves, and pedestrians often get left behind. Thankfully the ferries are pretty frequent.\\n\\nOccasionally the ferries have queues which can last hours, especially when one of the ferries is broken down. Because of this when your driver arrives at the ferry terminal, even if they are due to drive further it may make more sense to get out, walk onto the ferry alone and then hitchike away the other side without them, rather than waiting with their car in the queue. They can always pick you up again later.\\n\\nEven though most ferries are now free, in case you come across a paid ferry here is the old info on how to get onto them for free:\\n\\nWhen your driver enters a ferry, be sure he or she is not the first or second car in line. As soon as the person who collects the money from the cars, is with the first or second driver, get out of the car, go to the sundeck - or whereever else in the ferry - and back in the car when the boat is on the other side. Nobody will check on you during the ride or when the cars leave the ferry. Thus I would highly recommend you to be in a car while boarding a ferry. If you are not, just ask a few drivers! If you still cannot find a car, there\\'s also a few possibilities to sneak if you time it right and you are not seen by the officials.\\n\\n=== More advice ===\\nNorwegians have a tendency to always be on the rush on weekdays. Waiting times can be a bit longer around [[Oslo]] and in remote areas where traffic is very light. People expect some chatting since distances are long, and seem to have little tolerance for drug or alcohol use while on the road.\\n\\nA large part of the population lives near the road, which extends from the [[Sweden|Swedish]] border in the South to almost all the way North, so when going North it\\'s pretty hard to get lost, as long as you are headed the right way.\\n\\nThe roads going to Bergen and the West Coast (E16, 7, E134) aren\\'t very big, don\\'t expect motorways. They look more like small mountain roads, and are very nice to hitchhike along, you can stand directly on the road and admire the landscape at the same time. In winter (and fall and spring also) be aware that they might be closed to traffic due to snowstorms or pollution in the tunnels. The information is available for all roads in Norway on the internet.\\n\\nIt\\'s common knowledge that truck drivers are very friendly and that the hitching is great if you go out to the shipping areas around Dyre Halses Gate in [[Trondheim]] and North of Strandveien<sup>Which one? Does this question refer to the previous misspelling of Strandveien?</sup>, but some hitchhikers have said otherwise. It\\'s also much faster traveling alone considering that trucks and some commercial vehicle can only take 1 passenger. Around four in the afternoon, drivers have loaded incoming goods from that day and are leaving for a late/overnight haul to the next major city.\\n\\nDo think of the weather, it can get pretty cold and rainy (or snowy) and the distances are very big between the more populated east side of the country and the cities in the West Coast, or the North. Maybe taking a warm tent as I did was the best idea ever, the experience of camping in the woods in those mountains was very nice. \\n\\nThere are usually heated waiting areas at the ferry ports (even if small and remote), as waiting for a ferry can take some time and it can get very cold in winter. They are usually very clean and can be a good spot for sleeping and you will be able to ask for a ride the next morning. Most of them are equipped with toilets as well.\\n\\nRemember, hichhiking is about patience, so maybe you\\'ll have to wait for a good while (it IS true that there are not that many cars), but just enjoy the beautiful landscapes and you can always walk along the roads, they are not highways properly said.\\n\\nThe Kystruten is a daily shipping and passenger service along Norway\\'s coast, served jointly by the lines Hurtigruten and Havila. It calls in many towns along the way, starting in Bergen and going all the way up to Kirkenes on the Russian border. In many towns it stops for 3 or 4 hours and while it\\'s in port, you can go onboard as a visitor for free. Just have your ID handy. Many ships have saunas and some have hot tubs that you can use for free. If you stay on the ship for less than 24 hours, you don\\'t have to take a cabin, which makes the trip much cheaper. Also, students get a 50 percent discount. Capy hasn\\'t been checked for his student status on his three trips with Hurtigruten.\\n\\nIn Statoil gas stations, you can buy one of their cups for the equivalent of 30 euros and drink as much coffee, tea and hot chocolate as you like for one year.\\n\\n== Highway rest areas with paid showers ==\\n\\n\\nEastern Norway\\n\\nE6 Svinesundparken, Halden, Østfold\\n\\nE6 Fugleåsen, Ski, Akershus\\n\\nE6 Ormlia, Eidsvoll, Akershus\\n\\nE6 Circle K Minnesund, Eidsvoll, Akershus\\n\\nE6 Biri travpark, Gjøvik, Oppland\\n\\nE6 Vinstra vegpark, Nord-Fron, Oppland\\n\\nE6 Dovreskogen, Dovre, Oppland\\n\\nE18 Ørje, Marker, Østfold\\n\\nNR 3 Myklagard, Løten, Hedmark\\n\\nNR 3 Shell Koppang, Stor-Elvdal, Hedmark\\n\\nNR 3 Alvdal, Hedmark\\n\\n\\nSouthern Norway\\n\\nE18 Kjellstad, Lier, Buskerud\\n\\nE18 Furulund Kro & Motel, Stokke, Vestfold\\n\\nE18 Horisonten Lillesand, Aust-Agder\\n\\nE18 YX Lillesand, Aust-Agder\\n\\nE18 Circle K Lillesand, Aust-Agder \\n\\nE39 Circle K Livold, Lindesnes, Vest-Agder\\n\\n\\nWestern Norway\\n\\nE16 Shell Dale, Vaksdal, Hordaland\\n\\nE16 YX Skulestadmo, Voss, Hordaland\\n\\nE16 Shell Gudvangen, Aurland, Sogn og Fjordane\\n\\nE16 Steinklepp, Lærdal, Sogn og Fjordane\\n\\nE39 Esso Vikeså, Bjerkreim, Rogaland\\n\\nE39 Søylandskiosken, Gjesdal, Rogaland\\n\\nE39 Heiane, Stord, Hordaland\\n\\nE39 Bergen travpark, Vågsbotn, Hordaland\\n\\nE39 Haugsvær, Masfjorden, Hordaland\\n\\nE39 Esso Skei, Jølster, Sogn og Fjordane\\n\\nE134 Best Kyrping, Etne, Hordaland\\n\\n\\nCentral Norway\\n\\nE6 Oppdalsporten, Oppdal, Trøndelag\\n\\nE6/E39 Circle K Klett, Trondheim, Trøndelag \\n\\nE6 Stav Gjestegård, Malvik, Trøndelag\\n\\nE6 YX Gråmyra, Levanger, Trøndelag\\n\\nE6 Best Brekkvasselv, Namsskogan, Trøndelag\\n\\nE39 Digerneset, Skodje, Møre og Romsdal\\n\\nNR 70 Håsøran, Sunndalsøra, Sunndal, Møre og Romsdal  \\n\\n\\nNorthern Norway\\n\\nE6 Mosjøen, Vefsn, Nordland\\n\\nE6 Fauske, Nordland\\n\\nE6 Innhavet, Hamarøy, Nordland\\n\\nE6 Buktamoen, Målselv, Troms\\n\\nE6 Circle K Storslett, Nordreisa\\n\\nE6 Shell Talvik, Alta, Finnmark\\n\\nE6/E75 Tana bru, Finnmark\\nNR 80 Bodø havn, Nordland\\n\\n== North Norway ==\\nHitchhikers had varying experiences in the beautiful North.  Some locals hitch regularly to commute. You can hitch a ride from mostly anywhere as there is not much traffic. Another challenge are the long winter nights, which make the hitchhiking day very short unless you are well equipped for [[Hitchhiking at night|night hitchhiking]]. In the North, total darkness sets in from around mid-November. Don\\'t forget the specifics of [[Winter|winter hitchhiking]].\\n\\n\\n=== Hitching rides on ferries ===\\nIf possible, try to find out the ferry schedule. Hitch on the side where the cars drive into the ferry because in many places it\\'s hard to hitch on the other side. You can maybe knock on people\\'s windows when they wait for the ferry, especially if they come early and have to wait long, it\\'s easy to talk to them. You can maybe try to hitch into cars that have already paid for the ferry but on almost all car ferries, and definitely all the short distance ones, you pay extra for each passenger so that would be sneaking. In a few ferries the driver might have paid for the car not dependent on passengers, but that is a rare case. \\nBlackriding the ferries is also very easy most of times. Just don\\'t show up too much, there is always a queue (long or not) of cars waiting for it, ticket sellers are on board or at the harbour and they go directly, one by one to each car to make the ticket. When the ferry arrives and the ticket sellers (can recognize them easily) are busy making tickets to cars just enter the ferry and nobody will tell you anything, the guys at the entrance of the boat are not supposed to check tickets just to tell cars where to go so they won\\'t stop you nor anything, just think that you have already paid before. Of course if there are other \"backpackers\" stay away from them cause they are the first to be approached for tickets when the boat arrives. Fede, his brother and a Polish hitchhiker (that makes 3 people together) easily entered in that way every time, from [[Lofoten]] Islands to [[Bodo]] as around Sognesfjord and [[Bergen]]\\n\\nPopular Ferry routes to Denmark and Germany are Kristiansand-Hirtshals, Larvik-Hirtshals (ColorLine), Oslo-Frederikshavn and Oslo-Göteborg-Kiel (StenaLine). With ColorLine, cars carrying up to 5 people don\\'t pay extra, so it\\'s possible to hitch a ride on the ferry for free (not correct any more as of November 2012: extra passenger is EUR 5. It would be an acceptable price, but since ALL of the drivers buy tickets on-line with 50% discount, it\\'s almost impossible to catch a ride at the ticket office. We had to give up and hitchhike all the way to Oslo, Sweden and then Denmark. So you better don\\'t rely on this possibility)  StenaLine operates overnight only, so even if you manage to find a car, they\\'ll still force you to pay for a very expensive berth (500+ kr). If you\\'re heading to Denmark (the ports of Hirtshals and Frederikshavn are quite close to each other) it makes no sense to take the StenaLine from Oslo, because it takes a really long time (12h!!! that\\'s the way to make you spend as much as possible on board) and you can sail from [[Larvik]] in about 4h, which is reasonably close to Oslo to reach in about 2 hours.\\n\\nA note about hitching trucks!

I would divide Norway in two \\'\\'countries\\'\\' - North and South (let\\'s assume Mosjoen is an imaginary \\'\\'border\\'\\'). People in the North are very nice and friendly, you do not wait for a ride much (1-30min), and it is mostly Norwegians who give you a ride. You go south, it is getting more and more difficult, especially around the Oslo-Stavanger-Trondheim triangle. You can get a ride after 5 min, but also after 2 hours (Rjukan was the most terrible experience). Not more than 10% of Norwegians will pick you up in the south - they are afraid, not that happy with the immigrants, and that makes them very untrustworthy towards any foreign face. A bunch of German tourists gave me a ride, Dutch, guest workers, etc. If I have to grade my experience - North 3.5 out of 5, South 2 out of 5. Oh yes, one more important thing. In the North, people could stop anywhere, but better at bus stops. In the South, you MUST be at the designated stop as people really got hectic about it. :)\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n[https://www.facebook.com/groups/hitchhikersnorway/ Hitchhikers in Norway] FB group </br>\\n[[wikivoyage:Norway]]\\n\\n\\n{{hitchbase_country|147}}\\n{{IsIn|Scandinavia}}\\n\\n\\n[[Category:E6|E6]]\\n[[Category:Norway]]\\n[[Category:Northern Europe]]\\n[[Category:East Route from North Cape to Cape of Good Hope]]\\n\\n[[de:Norwegen]]\\n[[es:Noruega]]',\n",

You\\'ll have to take the S-Bahn for 15 minutes and then walk another 30-40 minutes to the service area. \\n\\nFrom \\'\\'Nürnberg Hbf\\'\\' (the main train station) you take the \"S2\" to \\'\\'Feucht\\'\\'. When you leave the train station you follow \"Bahnhofstraße\" until you reach a roundabout where you turn right onto \"Friedrich-Ebert-Straße\".  You follow this street until you reach the \"Schwabacher Strasse\" where you turn right again and continue straight. You\\'ll cross a crossroads where you see a McDonalds on your left. Continue straight on \"Schwarzenbrucker Straße\" passing an industrial area until the road makes a turn to the left after which you\\'ll turn right into \"Am Brückkanal\" - basically you continue straight. Now walk on straight until you reach the highway and the end of the parking of the service area. For Munich you\\'ll have to take the tunnel to the other side, for Berlin you can stay on the side you are on.\\n\\n=== A9 direction towards [[Berlin]]  ===\\nYou\\'ll have to take the S-Bahn \"S2\" towards \"Feucht\" for 15 minutes until the stop \"Fischbach\". From there it is about a 2km walk along the expressway to the on-ramp onto the A9 where you can hitch under the bridge. Cars have enough space to stop behind you in the turn. You can also try to catch a ride to the on-ramp at the traffic light next to the station (or possibly onto the highway).\\n\\n=== A6 Directions East ([[Prague]]) and West ([[Heilbronn]], [[Stuttgart]]) ===\\nTake the U1/11 metro to \\'\\'Langwasser-Süd\\'\\' (southern terminus).

Total walking distance is about 2 km till you see a bridge in 100 metres after the spot. \\nIf you\\'re tired or lazy, you can also start hitching at \\'\\'Liegnitzer/Gleiwitzer\\'\\' crossing, you risk to wait longer though. There\\'s also a bus line going that way, check out the map at the U station. \\nWhen you go direction Prague, use a [[signs|sign]] \"[[Amberg]]\". There will be the [[petrol station hitchhiking|petrol station]] \"[[Oberpfälzer Alb South]]\" shortly before that city. So it\\'s not a bad idea to wait for someone going across the border at the petrol station. \\nOtherwise you can go with local traffic from Amberg to the border, hitching from one motorway entrance to another. In this case, you\\'re likely to end up at [[Waidhaus]], the last German village before the border. If you were dropped in the village, instead of going back to motorway, you can take local crossing, leading to the town of [[Rozvadov]]. Once the other side, cross the town and about a km further will be a motorway entrance with a huge petrol station.\\n\\n=== A6 Direction East ([[Prague]]) (alternate method)  ===\\nThere is green space to wait just before the \"Hans-Kalb-Str.\" bus stop and the bus stop gives cars space to pullover.

I have not tried the above-mentioned strategy but I believe this one is good because it is closer to the city-center and traffic volume is quite high, and I saw several Czech license plates. There is also much less walking required as you can take the 44 bus directly to that stop, or take the S-Bahn S2 or S3 to the Frankenstadion stop and walk the very short distance from there\\n\\n=== A3 direction South-East ([[Regensburg]]), ([[Passau]]) and ([[Austria]]) ===\\n\\nFrom Nürnberg Hauptbahnhof take the S-Bahn in direction of Altdorf (b Nürnberg) and get off at WEST Altorf. The ticket costs 4.70€ but you can try to get on the train for free since it takes 20 minutes to reach WEST Altdorf. For my part, i haven\\'t seen any controllers. From there walk uphill on Fischbacher Strasse for 300 meters, turn right on Schulstrasse Strasse for 300 more meters and turn right again on Nürnberger Strasse. It\\'s the Boulevard leading to the A3 motorway going to Regensburg, Passau near the Austrian border and Linz. Walk along the boulevard for 200 meters where you can see BMW and Mercedes centers and until you see the motorway. Walk under the motorway and right after you\\'ll see the entrance on your left. The spot is perfect to hitchhike and you can expect to get a lift in less than 25 minutes. Also trucks have more than enough space to stop.\\n\\n===A3 direction West and North-West ([[Würzburg]], [[Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Kassel]])===\\n\\nThere\\'s a service station called \"Aurach\" on the A3 between Erlangen and Herzogenaurach.\\nFrom train station Nürnberg Hbf you can take a local train or S-Bahn to Erlangen train station, from there on take Bus 287 direction \"Westfriedhof\" - exit at last but one stop (\"Sankt Michael\" in Steudach). From there you can easily walk in 10-15 minutes to the petrol station (check spot on the map).\\n\\n==Sleeping==\\n\\nIf you dont find any place to crash on you can take subway to the airport, it takes like 30 minutes to get there from centre. There are few really nice spots on benches without armrests, there is also free wifi and bathroom. Nobody bothered me there during night and also there was some other sleeping people. \\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n__NOTOC__\\n\\n[[Category:Autobahn|autobahn]]\\n[[Category:Germany]]\\n\\n[[de:Nürnberg]]',\n",

In general you want to get a lift taking you directly out of the Ruhr area when you are going long distances (lets say towards [[Berlin]] or [[Munich]]), since the autobahn network there is fairly confusing and it is quite hard to get back onto the right autobahn once you left it. \\nI recommend the ''Kreuz Oberhausen-Holten'' to get onto the A3, becoming the A2 direction north towards [[Hannover]] and A3 south direction [[Frankfurt]]. You have a bridge there to not get your thumb wet in case it rains and people tend to stop for you within the first 15 min. \\nTo get onto the A40 I recommend taking the tram 112 (dir. [[Mülheim an der Ruhr|Mülheim]]), get out at ''Willy-Brandt-Schule'' and walk back to the entrance of the autobahn.

It\\'s the third largest city in Denmark, known primarily for being the birth town of Hans Christian Andersen.\\n\\n\\n== Hitchhiking in ==\\n\\n\\n===From West (Germany, Jutland)===\\nYou can get of at almost all of the exits around Odense and catch a bus to the center, but at exit 52 Odense SV it is very easy for the driver to hold in at a supermarket Lidl. To get here you drive left towards the city center and right in the traffic light. Here the car can turn and drive back to the highway. From here you can also catch a to the city center. The bus stop is right after the traffic light. It is also possible to walk, it will take you around an hour (6 km).\\n\\n===From east (Copenhagen)===\\nYou can get of at Motorvejskryds Odense SØ \"exit\" 49. If you drive off the highway and follow it until the big roundabout you\\'ll find a rest stop called Rasteplads Odense SØ. From there you driver can get back on the highway and you can walk towards the city and catch a bus to the center.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n===East towards Sjaellend, Copenhagen, Sweden===\\n\\nMost of the traffic leaving Odense in this direction is funnelled onto the E20 via the junction near Svendborgvej.\\n\\nHowever very recently this junction has been redesigned, and it\\'s now much harder to hitch that it used to be. Your best bet is to stand halfway down Drejebaeken, where the road curves you\\'ll see a space on the island in the middle of the road where cars can pull in. There are lots of traffic here, however it IS illegal for pedestrians to be on this street, and it is illegal for the cars to stop here. But I could not find a more suitable hitching spot. \\n\\n\\nIf you don\\'t want to stand there, there\\'s a gas station near the McDonalds. Or try signing at the Flixbus bus stop near the McDonalds - but it\\'s close to the roundabout and the cars see you pretty late. Signing before the roundabout means you miss the traffic leaving the gas station and the McDonalds.\\n\\n\\nAlternatively, there is another big junction 2km west at Dalumvej. However here the traffic are coming from four different roads so you won\\'t have the same concentration on traffic.\\n\\n\\nIf you\\'re really having a bad time east out of Odense, it could be worth your time hitching west to the Kildebjerg gas station and looking for a ride east from there. Like I said, it\\'s not easy. Also important to remember - when travelling east, you\\'ll be going over the Great Belt Bridge which has a £35 euro toll. As with the ferries, this charge is per car.\\n\\n===West towards Jylland (Jutland) and Germany===\\n\\nIt is normally very easy to hitchhike out of Odense towards Jutland and Germany. There is a bus stop just before the entrance 52 Odense SV to the highway where you can stand and catch all the traffic from Odense to the highway. To get here you can take bus 151-153: Assens/Brændekilde to the bus stop Vestre Boulevard, which is the spot. Or you can take bus 51-59: Bellinge/brændekilde and get of at Heliosvænget. From here you walk back in the direction from where the bus came, turn left at the first road you see, follow the pavement/bikeline under the big road, turn left up the stairs and you are there. When you take the bus you can see the signs for the highway and the spot, but the bus turn left in the traffic light just before, it dos not stop there. \\n\\nIt is important to be aware that the highway splits just after the bridge to Jutland, so if you are going south towards Germany, but your driver is going north towards ex. Aarhus, you have to get out at a gasstation before the bridge or at the exit/entrance of Fredericia (would not recommend this place)  To awoid getting stuck you can either wait for a ride going south or get of at Lillebælt Nord (pic) right after exit 57 Nørre Aaby.. It can take some time to get a ride south from there, but it works.. From there it goes quite easy; there are a lot of gasstations after Kolding.\\n\\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\\n\\n[[nomad:Orense]] [[trash:Odense]]\\n\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|Syddanmark}}\\n{{hitchbase_city|714}}\\n\\n[[Category:Denmark]]\\n[[Category:Syddanmark]]',\n",

Take direction to the Central Autostation, exit the trolleybus on station Khimichna (остановка Химическая or зупинка Хiмiчна) and walk right. You\\'ll see main street Grushevskogo (Грушевского). Cross this street and turn left. You will see your spot. Best is to hitchhike from there with sign \"КИЕВ\" (Kyiv)\\n\\nTake bus 84 from in front of the Central Railway Station. Ask the ticket seller for the stop Kievskaya trasa. From near the stop you can see a road signposted for Kiev.\\n\\nParticipants of the 789 Festival found this a challenging direction to hitchhike, with waiting times typically around 3-5 hours. The road soon becomes a modern motorway where cars are moving far too quickly to stop, so you cannot be easily dropped off and continue onwards. Try to get a lift all the way to your destination.\\n\\nA good \\'alternative option\\' seems to hitch from the WOG service station right at the motorway to Kyiv, located about 1 km from Khimichna/Grushevskogo. We caught a ride straight to Kyiv from there in the middle of a summer night.

It\\'s a huge roundabout with a monument in the middle, called \"dva stolba\" that people are familiar with by name. It is a busy bus stop for Marszrutkas where locals also hitch rides. You may want to go up the road a few meters to get away from the crowd. You can also take M16 to Chisnau (next road just to the north), but be aware that you will pass through [[Transnistria]].\\n\\nGetting there:Take Bus 128 or Marshutka 233 west from Velyka Arnauts\\'ka St in the center to Dva Stolba. Walk to the other side of the circle, 2nd left (there is a sign). Or take bus #201 from the main tram stop next between the central station and the big market.

There is a lot of business in the town. Already in ancient times Ohrid was a important town on the road ''via egnatia'', which led from [[Rome]] to the former [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]. The influence of the different times and religions (muslim and orthodox christians) can be seen and makes this town very impressing.\\n\\n== Hitching out ==\\n\\n=== North, direction [[Struga]], [[Skopje]] and [[Tirana]] ===\\nWalk out of the old town direction north-west on '''Bulevard Turistichka'''. You can already try to hitch here with a sign saying [[Kicevo]], Struga or Skopje. There is also cheap local transport to [[Podmolje]] (6 km), the intersection of the highways to Skopje and Struga, from where it should be easier to catch a ride going your way.\\n\\nTo Tirana: From Struga bus station walk south to the roundabout and turn right onto the A2. Walk past the shops and round the slight bend. There is a decent shoulder to hitchhike from in front of a few warehouse type stores.  Once you have reached that spot you may be offered a ride to the border. Say yes. Then, after crossing the border you can walk about 2-3 km on the Albanian side to reach to the main road, where you will be easily picked up. If you don't want to walk you may be asked by taxis for a ride to the main road, but the price can be extremely  high for 2km.  \\nAlternatively, don't catch the bus to struga but walk further west on Bulevar Turisticka. Near the onramp there are two petrol stations that are frequented by Albania cars. You can ask around there for a ride to Albania.\\n\\nI hitched from Struga directly to Tirana after waiting about half an hour at the coordinates  41°11′00.29″N 20°40′11.7″E (solo male, July 2017)\\n\\n=== South, direction Galičica National Park, Sveti Naum & Pogradec ([[Albania]]) ===\\nWalk out south-east/south on '''Bulevard Turistichka'''. It's about 10 km along the lake till the border and there are many good places to stop a car once you are out of Ohrid. \\n\\nMost traffic will not go further than to the monastery Sveti Naum. However, you can walk to Pogradec, which is about 7.5km away and takes 90 minutes. Try hithching a ride along the main road.\\n\\nInfo on Galičica Naitonal Park: The main entrance to the Park is located a couple of minutes south from the town of Trpejca. It is very common to ask for rides there that take you up to the park, e.g. the starting point of the Magoro Trail. \\n\\n\\n== Sleeping ==\\nIn July & August of 2024, there will be [[Autostop House]] established in Ohrid by Polish hitchhikers, where you can crash on the floor for a few nights.\\n\\nA very good spot to wildcamp, inside the city, is right behind the Sv. Sofia church, very central. Behind it (opposite part of the square), there is a road leading to the beach, you will notice a theatre, where some orchestra play in the night, right beside the theatre you have a little park, very hided and perfectly central, there is also tap water available. You can put your tent everywhere but the best spot is a roof of a little garage, 10-15 metre on the left from the entrance. \\nOn the other side of the city, u have also a beach, but a bit dirty and some weird people around. Better, Sv. Sofia.\\nFor other paying options more than these here below there is also a good list on Wikivoyage.\\nJust walk with your [[backpack]] to the harbour on the lake, there will be some private people who will ask you if you want a place to stay. With them you can go and take a look in the room they are offering to you. Then you can decide weather you want to stay or not. The room should cost between 5 to 12 Euro per night.\\n\\nEdward1012 was planning to camp, but was offered a bed for 5 euros a night by the Filceska family. Good location, Hot Shower, Clean, Kitchen and light refreshments, It is worth helping them out; Jovanka's husband died early 2015 and so its been a tough time for them. Their address: Marko Nestoroski 35, Ohrid. \\n\\nAnother option to sleep nearly for free is to ask at the orthodox monasteries. They have simple rooms for you and you will probably get something to eat too. It is polite if you give them a donation.\\n* ''I camped behind Sv. Sofia 2 days, leaving also my tent and backpack alone during the whole day. the spot is perfectly hidden and easy to reach.

Prefer cars that take you behind Brno in your direction.\\n\\n=== Northwest towards [[Mohelnice]] {{Dcz|35}}{{E|442}} ===\\n\\nNice spot is in the end of streets Pražská and Erenburgova. There is a roundabout after which it is possible for car to stop. \\n\\nTo get there: Get on a Upper square (Horní náměstí) in centre of Olomouc.

[[Çıralı]] is a village 500 m from Olympos beach.\\n\\n===Hitching In===\\n\\nGet dropped at the top of the road to Olympos. From there, it's an 11km hike down the hill (and is quite dangerous as the road is very thin in a lot of places). The best place to thumb a ride is about 200m down the hill from the bus station; there is a large shoulder on the side of the road where cars coming down will see you and have room to pull over.\\n\\nAnother option is to try and hitch into [[Çıralı]], as that's a town not consisting of solely tourists. From there you can walk 500m on the beach and you're down at the ancient Olympos site. The road to [[Çıralı]] goes off the Fethiye-Antalya 'highway' a bit further direction Antalya.\\n\\n===Sleep===\\n\\nTo sleep on the beach is complicated because it is closed from 22 to 5.

[[Iran]] by sea through the [[ferries in the Persian Gulf]].\\n\\nHitchhiking in Oman (especially in the more populated north) is quite easy.<br/> - \\'\\'In fact I found it loads more easy in the south. The north and its people feel a bit more european.. Nevertheless north and south it\\'s been the best hitching experience I had anywhere in the world! Some moments a car went by not stopping for me and I was actually stunned that it didn\\'t stop, I had forgotten that some people don\\'t stop for hitchers! ;-)\\'\\'<br/>\\nLocals are curious about people standing in the middle of nowhere and give you a lift because they want to know what you are doing here. Food is sometimes \"included\". Most of the petrol stations (as well other places; from embassies to reataurants) have free filtered water on an outside wall, which you can use to refill supplies.\\nHitching in the remote areas of Oman is incredibly easy — as soon as a car comes along. If you have to wait more than a few minutes for a car, then the chances that it will stop are very good. Waiting in a spot and then starting to walk when a car comes helps greatly, the Omani are extraordinarily kind people, and will feel obliged to stop and help you out.\\n\\n\\'\\'It\\'s also possible to hitch the taxi\\'s that roam the roads. If you do it right, you can get about 20% of your lifts in free taxis. If you are walking besides the road, turning around and thumbing when a car passes, but not thumbing for a taxi, often they stop anyway. They drive up besides you, and ask you where you are going. Tell them \"maafi fluce\"(I have no money), and tell them that you are walking to your destination. Often they will let you in for a free ride, it happens quiet often if your walking on the side of the road. And don\\'t worry, once your in, they will not then turn around and ask you for money at the end of the ride - Oman\\'s taxi drivers are the nicest I\\'ve ever found in the world.\\'\\'\\n\\nAlthough english is spoken by virtually everyone and most signs are in both languages, learning how to read and pronounce arab letters can be a good idea. People will open up even more at foreigners showing the smallest effort to learn their language. <br/>\\n\\'\\'Many locals were surprised when they noticed me reading arab letters! Sometimes I found it helpful to know pronunciation of letters when trying to say a city\\'s name, as with english spellings don\\'t tell me the difference between \"t\" and \"T\" (and there is one). Arabic Alpha is a free app for iPhone an Android and I found it most helpful of all things I tried.\\'\\'<br/>\\n\\'\\'It\\'s not mine and neither get I paid for saying this. ;-) --Marcel\\'\\'\\n\\n== [[Muscat]] ==\\nHitching in and around the area of Muscat is more difficult, making up for the ease of the rest of the country. Too much traffic, too many taxis, and the people see too many tourists. They are curious, but often by the time they decide to make a decision they have been swept away by the rest of the traffic. Using the micro-buses inside the city might be a viable option as they only cost 500 baizas (1.25$). Most of them go to the central terminal in the Ruwi area, which is also the terminal for long-distance buses.\\n\\n\\'\\'Travelling as a couple or two couples I made a different experience in the capital: Many a times we\\'d wait less than 5 minutes and someone curious stops and literally turns into a free taxi, abandoning their own business and driving us where we wanted to go (within Muscat, which still can take more than half an hour) out of hospitality and curiousity.\\'\\'\\n\\nMuscat is a pain to get out of, it is an incredibly long, stretched and highly dense city, as all the people live along the coastal strip. One thing to try is finding a small entrance to the main road, and try waving to cars about to enter the highway, tell them you have no money for a taxi, if they could take you to where they are going. \\'\\'Or tell them that and why you don\\'t spend it on transportation, instead of lying. Omanis speak a decent english.\\'\\' Often times they will take you all the way to where you need to go in the city. As they hardly never see a backpacker, you are more of a novelty than the hordes of retired tourists and ex-pats that crowd the place.\\n\\n===Hitchhiking out===\\n=== Towards [[Sohar]] and the North West ===\\n====Option 1====\\n{{Coords|23.5695|58.1726}}<br>\\nThat is very good place on the intercity highway without taxis \\nYou can get here using bus #6 from here: {{Coords|23.5878|58.2485}} or {{Coords|23.6514|58.2043}}. Get off the bus here {{Coords|23.5706|58.1708}} and follow path which will lead you to the mentioned good place on highway.\\n\\n====Option 2====\\nTake a bus(A1 or 1) or taxi to Mabelah. Taxi cost almost same as bus along the main city road, 0.5 Rials from Gubra to Mabelah in 2024. The taxi will stop at this location {{Coords|23.6754|58.1376}} and will not go any further. Now you can take another taxi (0.2 Rials in 2024) to this location {{Coords|23.6835|58.1028}}. Here you can start hitchhiking, this roads has plenty of cars and taxis and leads to UAE border, but most of cars are not going far, so be ready for short lifts.\\n\\n====Towards Nizwa and Southwest====\\nTake Bus #9 and get out in Falaj Al Sham {{Coords|23.5025|58.3318}} or further. It\\'s end of city with very little amount of taxis here and hitchhiking here is very easy.\\n\\n== Southern Oman [[Dhofar]] ==\\nThe Dhofar region around Salalah in the south is quite hitchable. Many guest workers (mostly Pakistani and Indians) hitchhike to work there so it is nothing unheard of.<br/>\\n\\'\\'Marcel, 2017: I disagree. In 3 weeks and 3000km I haven\\'t seen a single local hitchhiking. Autostop seems to be more known than in Iran, yet also in the south people seemed to wonder how I got to the place where they picked me up.\\'\\'\\n\\nIt is recommended to clarify if your lift can take you into the next town, or drop you at a gas station close to the road. The heat is not as bad as in most other places in the Arabic Peninsula, but bad enough. You will still need good sun protection and water as you will sweat a lot. Inside towns or on gas stations though you can usually cool down as most bars, supermarkets and shops offer air conditioning. Due to a special climate the weather is moderate and extremely humid between June and September. It is said that there is a lot of tourism coming to Dhofar in this time to see (\\'\\'well, or not\\'\\') the supposedly neverending thick mist covering all Salalah area.\\n\\nThere are free public toilets, sometimes also including showers, on the beaches west of Salalah. As of April 2010 they were reasonably clean. \\'\\'\\'Al Fasayah\\'\\'\\' is the secret spot in this area and for sure without amenities, given it\\'s remoteness. After some 40 or 50km from Salalah towards Yemen there\\'s a sign for Fasayah or Fazajah to the left. From there it\\'s 10km of hiking down to the beach, enjoy! A skilled and adventurous driver could do it with a 2WD but many locals wouldn\\'t even dare in a rented  4x4! \\'\\'Hitch the Salalah-Yemen street in a pickup or jeep and chances are the driver\\'s gonna bring you down to the beach, but be prepared to walk back up on yourself! The mountain panorama is gorgeous and ten times worth it, even if you turn around without going the long way down to the beach. \\'\\'\\n\\n==Musandam==\\nIf you find yourself in the incredible region of Musandam, hitching on boats between the coastal villages is possible. You may have to pay a fisherman to get you out of Khasab; ask at the long row of moored boats between the castle and the main road. 10 OMR (25$) is a fair price for a ride to the Telegraph Island area, but you can haggle for less, especially if the fisherman is going out anyway.  Then with a little sign language you can hitch a ride for free or cheap between the many villages which are only accessible by boat. There is a large population of Pakistani expats who are truly hospitable. \\n\\nI didn\\'t hitch on the roads in Musandam but it\\'s probably the same as the mainland, if not easier thanks to the large numbers of Pakistanis and western tourists in 4x4s.\\n\\nThe castle in Khasab gives away free maps of Musandam with decent detail.\\n\\n==Visa info==\\n\\nOman has a \\'\\'\\'common visa facility\\'\\'\\' with [[UAE]]. If you obtained your UAE visa in [[Dubai]] airport (probably also when coming by [[ferry]] to Dubai, not [[Sharjah]]) and it is still valid for at least 3 weeks; then you can get a 3-weeks free visa for Oman. \\'\\'\\'ONLY if you asked for an extra stamp at the airport/ harbor where you enter the emirate of Dubai!\\'\\'\\' \\'\\'I entered UAE by ferry in 2017 and at the Omani border an officer told me free Omani visa gets only who declared upon entering Dubai that he or she wants to go to Oman and got an extra stamp from Dubai\\'s officer.\\'\\'\\n\\nIt\\'s only the countries mentioned on this site that are benefiting from this: [http://www.rop.gov.om/english/dg_passport_visa_dubai.asp]. What that website does not mention though, is that this is ONLY possible if you \\'\\'\\'go through the [[Hatta]] border\\'\\'\\' (I hitched from [[Dubai]] down to [[Al Ain]] border, only to get the information that I had to go through [[Hatta]]). You still need the exit-stamp from [[UAE]], even though you want the 3-weeks free visa.\\n\\nThe price of the \"normal\" visa has increased and there are many websites that provide the old (cheaper) price. Check this website for the correct prices: [http://www.rop.gov.om/english/dg_passport_visas.asp]\\n<br/> In 2017 it was 5 Omani Rials (12.5$) for ten days, extendable by ten days in police offices dealing with immigration and visa. 30 day visa costs 20 Rials (50$) and is extendable as well. Extensions are only possible \\'\\'\\'for the same amount of time and same price\\'\\'\\' as original visa and time probably starts counting the day you\\'re extending it. So going to immigration offices two days after you entered Oman is a waste of money.<br/>\\n\\'\\'In Salalah the process took 3 hours including waiting time and one hour spent at a copyshop not far from the immigration office where we needed to get an official letter stating our wanting to get a visa extension. This letter was required by police, along with payment only possible by credit card. (But they quickly found a local who payed with his card and I gave him the cash.)\\'\\'<br/>\\nFind the location of Salalah immigration police at openstreetmaps.org - at least in [[Muscat]] the extension can be done as well, not sure about other cities. \\n\\n== Border posts ==\\n=== Khatmat Milaha border post (UAE) ===\\n{{Coords|24.9783|56.3649}}<br>\\nIn October 2024 it was allowed to cross it by walking. Foreigners can use that border. \\n\\n=== Khatm Al Shikla border crossing post (UAE) ===\\n{{Coords|24.2149|55.9552}}<br>\\nAs of October 2024, crossing was only permitted by vehicle.

Foreigners can use that border.\\n\\n== User experiences ==\\n===[[User:Alex|alex]]:===\\n* I found it easy to hitchhike in Oman, however, hitchhiking as such is not known and many people want to drop you of at the bus station or give you money that you can use the bus. When they grasped the idea, some wanted to make an additional way of 300 km just to bring me closer to my destination. Many people also just stopped for me out of curiosity. I had sometimes a hard time to find out where they go to and often ended up to have lift just for a couple of kilometres (being dropped at a bad spot). Further, I never used public transport in the cities as I found it easy to hitchhike there as well. Many people speak English. There are petrol stations along the motorways. No payment was expected for lifts. Great hospitality.\\n\\n===Marcel===\\nI hitched a hundred thousand kilometers on this planet and Oman beats it all. Yes, part of it may be since I like arabian culture, but there\\'s more to it. People, especially in the southern half, are so warm and hospitable, simply want to help where they can and satisfy their genuine curiousity, \\'\\'while\\'\\' actually remaining respectful. In some other places on earth I\\'ve met a massive hospitality, that however was bigger than freedom of both host and guest. In Oman I (male...) felt accepted and tolerated and no one seemed to try to force their culture/mind/thought-of-what\\'s-right-and-wrong on me. <br/>\\nThe country\\'s safe and clean (even kinda proper and made up here and there), wildcamping wasn\\'t a deal at all. Weather will be \\'\\'\\'very\\'\\'\\' hot in summer, best time temperaturewise is November through February/ March.\\n\\n===Martin===\\nI landed in Dubai and got a stamp for free since they now have an agreement with Schengen citizens. I then hitchhiked from there to the Hatta border in Oman and I got a free 21-days visa on the border. However, you first have to get out of UAE and cross the border checkpoint where you\\'ll have to pay something like 7 euros. I think they give it back to you if you keep the paper and go back to the UAE but I\\'m not sure since I then took a plane from Oman. \\nThat was in January 2018 and it was really easy. The border officers were interested in my trip from France to India hitchhiking. \\nThere are a few kilometers between the UAE border and the Omani border. Try to get a car before the UAE border or just catch a truck in between! Enjoy Oman, really nice place to travel and meet local people. Nature is also amazing!\\n\\n== Cities ==\\n*[[Muscat]]\\n*[[Salalah]]\\n*[[Ibri]]\\n\\n[[File:Oman.JPG|thumb|250px|left|[[User:Alex|alex]] hitching in Oman]]\\n\\n== Links ==\\n* [http://abgefahren.hitchbase.com/DE/blogs/alex/20090213/just-hitching-rides-a-journey-eid-christmas Just hitching rides: A journey from Eid to Christmas], abgefahren Blogs (article partly based on)\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n[[Category:Western Asia]]\\n[[Category:Middle East]]\\n[[Category:East Route from North Cape to Cape of Good Hope]]',\n",

It follows the highway to Ishim and Tyumen. Get off at the big roundabout at Krasny Yar. Then keep on walking about a kilometer on the highway. There are yellow side lines and cameras before so people don\\'t stop! A bit further there\\'s a bus stop where drivers can more easily pull over, but you can already try before when the yellow lines stop.\\n\\nIt should be easy to get rides to Ishem (300km) and Tyumen (550km). Look for cars with number plate \"72\".\\n\\nAlternatives would be the local busses 214, 190 (goes very rarely) and 922 through Druzhino. I very much recommend the first option though. Price is probably around 100 roubles. For the local busses 22.\\n\\n===Southwest towards [[Petropavlovsk]] ([[Kazakhstan]]) ===\\nSouth of Omsk there is a big bypass of the M51 situated, all continuing traffic passes here and therefor this is by far the most easy place to leave the city. The connection with public transport is good and there are little shops for water, fruits and tobacco in 15 minutes of walking nearby. \\n\\nTo reach this place find autobus 120, 121, 122, 156, 160 or marshrutka 420 to Пост Гаи “Post Gai” M51. At this stop you’ll find a roundabout with in the middle a ДПС (Police post). Walk over, from this place you can hitch-hike into the direction you wish.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Astana]] ([[Kazakhstan]]) ===\\nWATCH OUT, crossing this border is only for Russian or Kazakh passports!! Citizens of other countries need to go through the border that is close to Petropavl in Kazakhstan.\\n\\nFind marshrutka 420 in southern direction, get out after the stop Пост Гаи “Post Gai”. Walk along the road and keep right. Take the turn towards Одесское “Odesskoe”, pass the bridge and walk over to the crossing. At this point you can start hitch-hiking.\\n\\nThis is the shortest way to [[Astana]] but be aware of low traffic and when you hold a foreign passport you’re not allowed to cross at this border post.

It is one of the main transit points to [[Hungary]].\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n=== East towards [[Cluj-Napoca]] {{E|60}} ===\\n\\nThere are several ways of doing this.\\n\\n* If you are in Nufarul district, walk from the last tram stop to the big roundabout near Selgros hypermarket. Coming from the last tram stop (tram line 3), make a left at the roundabout. The big trucks that go around the city to Cluj-Napoca go through there.\\n* Get on a tram to December 1 park station (any tram line). Here ask for the traffic police station (\\'\\'politia rutiera\\'\\'), near the castle. If you are around the city centre, you can walk to it. This is the best way to Cluj-Napoca. Only the big trucks have to take the ring, while small cars go through the city, and will pass in front of you. Almost all the hitchhikers are there - many of them. It is the usual place for hitching in that direction. Many make the living from illegal transport service for these people, especially in the morning, and when people return from work to the villages, so clarify in every case if you are not willing to pay.<p>This is the best place because the environment is friendly, you can stay visible, streetlights are strong, there is place to stop, cars are slow and people know it is a place for hitchhikers. Waiting time is several minutes, even in dark, or bad weather.\\n* The road from there is Calea Clujului. It starts in the city and goes all the way to the outskirts, heading to [[Cluj-Napoca]]. By walking all the way to the edge of town is at least 1/2h, but 1h seems more realistic. Near the Metro hypermarket there is an intersection with traffic lights. You can hitchhike there. That is the end of the ring. There you will have both the big trucks, and those who go through the city. The environment is very unfriendly, and few realize you\\'re there. In bad weather or darkness there are no chances.<p>There is also a bus from the beginning of the Calea Clujului. The stop is in front of the San Paolo bank (same building with the police station). It is called Metro Bus.\\n\\n=== West towards [[Hungary]] {{European Route Number|60}} ===\\n\\nFrom Oradea it is 15 km to the [[Ártánd-Borş border crossing]]. Get to \\'\\'Calea Borsului\\'\\', at the end of the tram line, pass under the bridge, and walk some meters from the little road to the right. There you wait. You may get a lift to Bors, the last village in Romania which is close to the border, but many times people will take you to Hungary. If they can\\'t take you to Budapest, get out at the border, don\\'t go further. That is the best place to catch a ride to Budapest along the whole 250 km route (even taking in account places close to Budapest). If you go further, waiting times will increase significantly. Most of those who cross the border, go to Budapest anyway. Waiting time is a few minutes or 2 hours in daylight.\\n\\nThe hardest part is to get to the border. Sometimes it can be more than an hour to hitch those 15 km. It is worth avoid this wait by getting on a bus. They have big red ORADEA BORS inscription above the windshield, and they usually stop for hitchhikers. They also stop at the end of the tram line. The fare is 1 euro (4 lei).\\n\\nAlternatively (I did so in summer 2017) you can use public transport to get to a \"\\'Dacia zig zag\\'\" station (\"Pasaj Dacia\" on Google Maps [47.073915,21.911648]) and go by bus to Bors (\"Primaria Bors intors\" station). There are busses going almost every hour. Some of them to Bors (you\\'ll have to walk approximately 2km to the border crossing), some of them even to Hungary. The one to Bors cost me 5lei.\\n\\nAnd finally, you can also take a taxi to the border. It costs around 30 lei (7 euros) from Calea Borsului (you can do it via the [http://www.clevertaxi.com/l/app CleverTaxi app]). [[User:Kossabossa|Kossabossa]] and a friend did this after waiting for 2 hours at Calea Borsului, crossed the border on foot and got picked up within 5 minutes.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Satu Mare]] {{E|671}} ===\\n\\nThere are two places to hitch in this direction. One is central, near the railway station. As you stay in front of the main entrance of the station, it is about one hundred meters on your left. The second one is along the same road, Stefan Cel Mare, but at the end of it. There is a railway bridge above the street just at the second place. There you should stay at that mobile plastic roundabout.\\n\\n\\n=== South towards [[Arad]] {{E|671}} ===\\n\\nOn the street \\'\\'Calea Aradului\\'\\' (with, for example, tram 2) towards the edge of the city, until it crosses the ring. There is a big roundabout.\\n\\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\\n\\n[[nomad:Oradea]] [[trash:Oradea]]\\n\\n\\n{{Cities Romania}}\\n{{IsIn|Romania}}\\n\\n[[Category:Romania]]\\n[[Category:E60]]\\n[[Category:E79]]',\n",

When you walk underneath the railway bridge you can already see the highway in front of you and the first turn to the left is the road which goes unto the Hanshin Expressway. This highway meets the Meishin Expressway that goes towards Kyoto and later meets the Chugoku Expressway which goes into the Western direction towards Hiroshima. You should cross this road and stand with your sign as close to the road as possible so that cars that turn towards the highway can see you. There is a small place where they can stop, or if you are lucky one of the tollgates could be closed so that cars have a place to stop for you. For Hiroshima you should write down the name of the Takarazuka SA (Service Sation on the highway) on your sign.\\n* \\'\\'\\'Via Meishin Expressway\\'\\'\\' <p>(名神高速道路): From Shin-Osaka, take the Tokaido line (JR) to Ibaraki. Take the West exit. From here you can either walk or take a bus. If you walk, simply go down the main avenue up to the crossroads. Go right here and keep walking straight. Eventually (should take about 15-20 mins) you will see the Meishin Expressway entrance to your left. If you want to take a bus, simply hop on bus 92 and ride until you see the highway entrance. Just in front of the tollgates there is plenty of room for cars to stop.</p><p>Another option is to walk 2km from Kishibe Station (岸辺駅) to Suita Service Area (吹田SA). There are some \"do not enter\" signs on the gate of the parking lot you have to go through to access the tunnel to the SA, but they seem to be about keeping people from parking there, not keeping pedestrians out.</p>\\n\\n== Other useful info ==\\nAlways write down everything in kanji on your sign. Although Japanese people can generally read the Roman/Latin script, it takes them some time which could prove to be too long for them to understand what you have written down and stop for you.\\nYou can make a simple sign with either \"西\" (West, for Kobe, Hiroshima, etc) or \"東\" (East, for Nagoya, Tokyo, etc) on it. Works like a charm. \\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n[[Category:Japan]]\\n{{IsIn|Japan}}',\n",

There are several motorway entrances behind the tunnel. The further outside the city you are, the easier it gets. \\n\\n\\n=== North towards [[Trondheim]] {{E|6}} or northwest towards [[Molde]] or [[Ålesund]]  ===\\n\\nThis is a superb spot for heading north/northwest: a \"Circle K\" petrol station on the [[E6]] direction North. It is about a 2h walk from the center. The free bus to the nearby Ikea stopped operating. You could also jump on the metro line 1 or 2 to the stop (Trosterud) at earlier/later hours, sundays and it leaves at higher frequencies, but that would cost a one-zone ticket of 42 NOK (June 2024).\\nIMPORTANT!!! - Be aware of frequent ticket controls in the metro!!!\\n\\nThe Circle K is 10 minutes walk from IKEA. Once you are at IKEA just walk around the building to it\\'s right side, and you\\'ll se a pedestrian tunnel taking you under the E6. Straight on the other side, look to your right, a pathway following the highway takes you directly to the spot. When going north, you can quite easily find a ride here. Anyways, for shorter rides, the first good petrol station on the highway is  called \"Skedsmokorset\". You might be offered rides to the Oslo airport, in case you are trying to get further, make sure you jump off at Skedsmokorset.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'SKEDSMOKORSET\\'\\'\\' - SHELL Gas station 59.996979648163354, 11.039584005582046 This gas station is a perfect spot for heading north/northwest. You should filter out short rides. Be patient, there are many long-distance cars stopping there to get rest or fill up gasoline. To get there you need a two-zone ticket of 72 NOK (spring 2025) or just a very short local ride.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Göteborg]] {{E|6}} and east towards [[Stockholm]] {{E|18}} ===\\n\\nNote: If you\\'re heading to Sweden on the E18 you have to start on the E6. Be very careful as there is only one point where the E6 branches to the E18. It\\'s fairly easy to miss, but when you see it ask the driver to turn off even if they are continuing south. There is a roundabout where you can get out, and then the driver can get back on the E6.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1 - Barcode \\'\\'\\' \\n\\nWith the new iconic addition to the Oslo high-rise waterfront, Barcode, hitchhiking south directly from the city centre has become much easier, and thus removed the need for the 30 minute metro ride to Mortensrud (option 2). From the central station, just pass the high-rises until the end, where it turns right (and south). Follow the sidewalk on this for about 250 meters, until you get to a traffic light. On the right side of the road, there is possible for cars to stop (parking forbidden sign does not mean cars can\\'t pull over). You only need a ride to the shell station at Mortensrud in order to get going further.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2 - Mortensrud \\'\\'\\' \\n\\nTake metro line 3 to \"Mortensrud\" and get off at the last station, then cross the bridge over metro track and walk for about 300 meters. You will enter petrol station on motorway E6. Either ask drivers there, hitchhike on the busstop on the motorway just 100 meters next to the gasstation, on the onramp itself, or on the busstop before the onramp. Basically just go there and find your favorite way to find a ride going south.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\' Option 3 - From Ljansbakken (closer to the city than the other ones) \\'\\'\\' \\n\\nTake one of the following buses 83, 500, T9 to the stop Ljansbakken.\\nThis spot is before the road turns into a motorway at a busstop with plenty of space for people to pull over safely, a sign might be useful at this spot. \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 4 - Hellerud \\'\\'\\'\\n\\nYou may want to try Esso petrol station (diesel is cheaper there so lots of people fills up there and other advantage is there is a MC D. right next to it). To get there, take subway to Hellerud, turn right into Smalvollveien and walk till you get to Esso. Some might find useful to know that there seem to be fewer ticket controls on that line.\\n\\n\\n=== West towards [[Bergen]], or southwest towards [[Stavanger]] and [[Kristiansand]]===\\n\\nThe road to Bergen diverges from the southwestern road at Sandvika. If your ride is going the other way, just get off at one of the gas stations before Sandvika and keep hitchhiking from there. \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1 - Onramp at Skøyen\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nThis option is fairly close to the city centre. Take a train or a bus to (Skøyen), and walk southwest towards the highway. There is a big roundabout a a little closer to the hightway, and a 100 meters further down the onramp you\\'ll see a bus stop with plenty of space to pull over. This is a favorite spot for many hitchhikers heading west. From here option 2 is also close by, a gas station that is just 600 meters down the highway.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2 - Gas station at Maritim\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nTake the bus 31 or 31E to the stop (Maritim) and walk for 50 meters to the gas station close by. The station does not have too much traffic, but it is fairly easy to hitch a ride to the next gas station on the way towards Sandvika or Drammen, where there is more traffic heading northwest and southwest.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3 - Bergen direction only - Where the motorway ended\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nthere is bus 200 that goes from the City, you can catch it to the stop \\'\\'Avtjerna\\'\\' and hitch from the bustop. All motorway has ended and it is just country road all the way to Bergen. The con with this option is that it the bus only goes once an hour (and once every 2 hours on sunday). It is also quite far out from Oslo, and public transport can be pricey. But if you just miss the bus you can change to option 1 or 2.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 4 - Bergen direction only - Onramp at Sandvika\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nCatch a train to Sandvika, when you get off the train walk in the direction the train was moving for 100 meters, turn right and then left on the bigger road (Elias Smiths Vej), follow the road until a roundabout and turn right, and you will see the entrance to the highway. There you can stand with a sign hitchhiking to Hønefoss, where there\\'s a gas station.\\n\\n== Hitching In ==\\n\\n=== From Oslo (Rygge) Airport ===\\n\\nOslo (Rygge) is an airport located about 75 km South of Oslo, on the E6 direction Göteborg. To reach Oslo via HH, you simple need a sign for Oslo and you can either hitch from the airport or walk about 1.5 km to (North direction, along the motorway) the Rygge on-ramp where local traffic passes at the roundabout. The first petrol station is a few kilometres North, around Moss. From there it\\'s rather easy to get a direct ride to Oslo.\\n\\nYes, the airport is small, so traffic is light.  When you come out of the terminal building; the motorway in front of you is the E6, and Oslo (North) is to the right.  I walked the one mile along the airport service road (hitching without success)and then hitched from the roundabout.\\n\\nOr you can just stand at the end of the car park building on the slip road (turn right out of terminal building and walk until you reach the end of the building). I just hitched to Oslo city centre in one lift (by holding up an Oslo sign). The first car stopped. Or you can ask people at the airport if they\\'re going to Oslo. \\n\\n=== From Oslo (Torp) Airport ===\\n\\nOslo (Torp) is an airport located about 115 km South of Oslo, on the [[E18]]  direction [[Kristiansand]].\\n\\n=== From Oslo (Gardermoen) Airport ===\\n\\nOslo (Gardermoen) (OSL) Airport is located around 50 km North of Oslo, near [[E6]] towards [[Lillehammer]].\\n\\nTo reach Oslo, simply go to the multi-storey car park which is adjacent to the terminal and then follow arrows to the exit. Then head to the gates where drivers pay for the parking, it\\'s at the exit from the car park area. Stand right behind these gates. Payment takes a couple of whiles and drivers should have the time to notice you, there\\'s also a plenty of place for them to stop to pick you up.\\n\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n{{hitchbase_city|307}}\\n{{IsIn|Norway}}\\n\\n[[Category:Norway]]\\n[[Category:E6]]\\n[[Category:E18]]\\n[[Category:E16]]\\n\\n[[de:Oslo]]',\n",

If you're not sure, ask the driver to let you out along the ''Iburger Strasse'' and tell him you have to go to the [[A30 (Germany)|A30]]. The ''Iburger Strasse'' near the motorway is a two-lane carriageway. Here you have two options for hitchhiking: Some meters behind the traffic light you'll find a car dealer. There's enough space for hitchhikers to stop cars. This spot is good for both directions, you're standing directly in front of the ramps. If you're heading eastwards, you can also walk directly to the ramp. Walk around the bend and you'll find a hard shoulder to stand on. \\n\\nAttention: There are two ramps for direction east! It is recommended to take the ramp which is on the street going south (when you're coming from Osnabrück), the ramp on the other side is smaller and there's not much space for hitchhiking, also the road marking is in a bad condition there. Have a look to the map for relevant information.\\n\\n=== West towards [[Rheine]] [[Amsterdam]], South towards [[Münster]],[[Dortmund]], [[A1 (Germany)|A1]] ===\\n\\nTake Bus 91/92 towards ''Hörne'' or ''Hellern'' and get out at ''Kurt-Schuhmacher-Damm''.

If you are going south: After 5 km the A30 crosses the A1, while along the A1 the first service station ''Tecklenburger Land'' appears after no more than 5 minutes, so you can also go with cars who go for example to Münster. Though if cars go to Münster, one could consider, dependend on the weather, to better get off at on-ramp Greven. There is a great hard shoulder and a lot of traffic going south to at least service station ''Münsterland'' or Dortmund.\\n\\n\\n=== North towards [[Bremen]],[[Hamburg]], [[A1 (Germany)|A1]] ===\\n\\nTake the bus 81/82 towards ''Pye'' and get out at ''Bramscher Straße'', or take the bus 41 towards ''Haste'' and get out at ''Bramstraße'' and then get back to the Main road (Bramscher Straße). Keep walking the direction away from town, after 300 meters you see a Coka-Cola company. Some meters more, after some redlights, there begins an expressway leading to the Autobahn. Just stand at the begining of the expressway, there is still a sidewalk to stand on. There is also a hard shoulder so drivers can stop, and the will see you while stopping at the redlight at the other side of the crossroads.

In 1/2 mile you will arrive at a truck stop, which is a good hitch-hiking spot.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\' - Oxford Motorway [[rest area|service station]]\\n\\nDistance from Oxford 11 miles\\n\\nThe services are a good hitch-hiking spot, as they are visited by traffic bound for all directions - North/South (via M40), East (via A40) and West (via A418). \\n\\nThe site is accessible by public transport from Oxford - the bus no. 280 (towards Aylesbury) leaves Oxford from Queen\\'s Lane (stop K2) every 30-60 minutes. The journey takes 28 minutes.\\n\\nAn alternative option would be to start walking in the direction of Headington (St Clement\\'s Street, A420), and try to get a lift on the way towards the services or at least A40 (Thornhill Park and Ride or truckstop). There is a \"Shell\" [[petrol station hitchhiking|petrol station]] on London Rd in Headington, so you may try asking for a lift there. Until recently, it was possible to hitch-hike right next to this petrol station. However, a recent \"traffic improvement scheme\" introduced a bus lane there, so it\\'s not very convenient for people to stop there. However, there\\'s a lot of lay-bys along the A40 out of Oxford.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3\\'\\'\\' (North only)\\n\\nIf you are hitching up north, you can also try the A44/A34 junction (there is a petrol station there too). It\\'s a 3-mile walk or a bus journey to Pear Tree Park and Ride\\n\\n=== South towards [[Portsmouth]], [[Southampton]], [[Winchester]], [[M4 (GB)|M4 Motorway]], West towards [[Swindon]] ===\\n\\n* \\'\\'\\'Route:\\'\\'\\' A34\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\' - Botley [[Slip road|Interchange]]\\n\\nTake any bus going to Botley or Seacourt Park and Ride. Botley Interchange (A420/A34 roundabout) is a few hundred metres away from the Park and Ride site.\\n\\nThe best way to get on to Botley Interchange roundabout: when on the bus to Botley keep a look out for a 70s looking tower on your right. You will then pass under a bridge which carries the A34 (ring road). Just after the bridge there will be a small alley way on your right. Go up this path which takes you to the roundabout. It is the safest and best route.\\n\\nOn the A34 Southbound slip road there is a nice long area of hatched markings, which is a safe and convenient place for a vehicle to stop to pick you up. Also, the speed is limited to 50mph.\\nThis worked well for user [[User:Lnx|Lnx]] on the 22nd of February 2008 - the waiting time in the morning (7:05am) was about 4 (four!) minutes.\\n\\nThe A34 Northbound slip road is also useful. From here you can hitch towards Junction 9 on the M40, from where you can travel North or South. If you then want to travel north on the M40 it is best to be dropped off on the layby just before the juntion. Because the slip road down the motorway is unsuitable for hitching. You will need to make a sign saying \\'M40 North\\' or something similar. The M40 takes you north towards Birmingham or South towards London. It\\'s probably best not to hitch to the North end of Oxford ring road, because the junctions there are very confusing and you might have to walk a long way to find the right road.\\n\\nFrom the same roundabout A420 continues to the west towards [[Swindon]] via rural Oxfordshire. This road has low speed limits and speed cameras - for this reason most traffic going to [[Swindon]] and [[Bristol]] uses A34 and [[M4 (GB)|M4]].\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\' - A4074/A34 junction. This is the junction where A34 meets the Oxford\\'s Southern Bypass Rd. \\n\\nHere you can either hitch on the slip road, or walk along A34 to the South or 1/2 a mile - there is a nice and long lay-by, where all A34 Southbound traffic is able to stop.\\n\\n== Oxford Motorway Services ==\\n\\nDistance from Oxford 11 miles\\n\\nThe services are a good hitch-hiking spot, as they are visited by traffic bound for all directions - North/South (via M40), East (via A40) and West (via A418). \\n\\nThe site is accessible by public transport from Oxford - the bus no. 280 (towards Aylesbury) leaves Oxford from Queen\\'s Lane (stop K2) every 30-60 minutes. The journey takes 28 minutes.\\n\\nAn alternative option would be to start walking in the direction of Headington (St Clement\\'s Street, A420), and try to get a lift on the way towards the services or at least A40 (Thornhill Park and Ride or truckstop).

However, there\\'s a lot of lay-bys along the A40 out of Oxford.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking in ==\\n\\nTo get into Oxford, have somebody drop you off at Oxford Motorway Services. Walk out of the services, turn left and you\\'ll see a perfect lay-by a hundred metres down the road.

From the Padova train station you take bus M to Neroniana neroinane Montegrotto, and walk about five kilometres, following the road. [[User:Husky|Husky]] got a ride under ten minutes, but you should definitely check it out on Google Maps before going there.\\n\\n=== North, towards [[Bassano del Grappa]], [[Trento]], Dolomites ===\\n\\n=== West, towards [[Vicenza]], [[Verona]], [[Milano]], [[Torino]] ===\\nOne spot where you can head to the West is the petrol station on A4 autostrada called \\'\\'\\'<!-- [http://www.q8-limenella.com/dove.htm-->Limenella Nord<!-- ] -->\\'\\'\\'. It\\'s located about 2kms west of Padova Ovest exit along the autostrada. The petrol station is easy reachable through countryside roads especially by car, or walking near the autostrada from Padova Ovest heading west, or, coming from Padova city centre, taking number 11 bus and getting off in Ponterotto, then you need to walk along Via Monta until you reach the autostrada, go under it and follow at first Via Marcinelle then the smaller road to the right which might not have a sign but which on Google Maps is marked as Via Vasco de Gama till the petrol station along the north side of the autostrada. One thing to watch out is that the number 11 bus is actually the one going to Ponterotto as there seem to be different routes for this bus which can be confusing to anyone not used to the system. A sure way to find out is to ask the driver or people in the bus station.\\n\\n[edit] The \"Ponterotto\" Station is indeed small and unkown even to some drivers. I found the bus at platform 5, heading to \"Camisano\" (August 2017). I got confused about the way after passing below the highway (\"...and follow at first Via Marcinelle then the smaller road to the right which might not have a sign...\") because the way split up in several directions. If you are willing to jump a small fence and walk around 250m through an abandoned sewer drain, you can find the gas station by just walking sideways along the Highway.\\n\\nTry.

It is situated within a ring road called \\'\\'le périphérique\\'\\', or \\'\\'le périph\\'\\'. The actual city is relatively small, but is surrounded by endless suburbs, which are linked to the urban public transportation system at no extra cost, as since January 2025 the Metro and the RER (suburban trains, not to be confused with Transilien trains) have a unified fare system.\\n\\nNote that there is an \"outer ring road\" to the Paris suburb area, motorway A86 (or \\'\\'super-périphérique\\'\\') and another wider ring even further called \"la Francillienne\" which isn\\'t completed but still used to connect . If your ride is not going to Paris itself, you might want to clarify which ring they are going to take as it may affect the place where you\\'d want to be dropped. You may also find them useful if you need to bypass Paris, especially the Francilienne, as it has more gas stations and less complex interchanges.\\n\\nGood to know if you\\'re starting to stink up in the City of Lights: the Municipality provides [https://www.paris.fr/pages/les-bains-douches-municipaux-138 free shower facilities ] in 17 locations around Paris. Note they are BYOT (bring your own toiletry).\\n\\n[[File:888_signs.jpg|thumb|240px|right|A small collection of the \"Paris\" signs for the [[Project 888]] where over 150 hitchhikers gathered and camped in front of the Eiffel Tower.]]\\n\\n== Hitching in ==\\n\\nDuring rush hours, it is possible (but illegal) to be quickly dropped on the ring road. This is useful if your ride is not willing to get out of it to drop you (which is often the case). Within the ring area, you are definitely linked to the whole regular fare subway system.\\n\\nIf you are coming from the Northeast and your ride is heading South (which is a normal truck route), chances are that your driver will not drop you on the ring road where it is complicated to stop. A frequent place to get dropped is the first exit South on the A6 called \"Rungis\". From there, you can reach the Metropolitan subway system by tram with one ticket, then use another one to your final destination. You can also reach other suburbs in the 94 department (Val de Marne) taking the TvM bus, which is also a normal Paris ticket.\\n\\n== Getting around ==\\n\\nIf you need to use the Metro and don\\'t want to pay for an ever more exorbitantly priced ticket (€2.50 now!): [https://paris-luttes.info/IMG/pdf/bahalorspageparpage-2.pdf here] is a detailed guide on blackriding. It\\'s in French but here are some main takeaways:\\n* An easy way to get in is to stand in front of an exit gate and reach your arm to the sensor on the other side to trigger its opening (as illustrated in the guide)\\n* Otherwise, the main types of entrance gates are:\\n# Turnstile with a half-gate behind it: wait for someone to pass so that the half-gate is open and is slowly closing, jump over the turnstile or sneak under it, go through the space left open (easier if you\\'re skinny)\\n# Short glass doors: literally just push them forward with a bit of force. Genius move by the RATP who are expanding this type to more and more stations.\\n# Tall glass doors: these are tricky. Find another type or use an exit gate.\\n* Be careful to avoid busy stations with 3 lines or more (Châtelet, République, Nation, the main train stations, etc) as ticket inspectors tend to concentrate there, but you can get always get a bad surprise. They congregate at corridor angles where they can\\'t be seen ahead of time, so keep an eye out for foot traffic that is slowing in front of you, or voices saying things like \"contrôle des titres de transport, s\\'il vous plaît\".\\n\\nThe same goes for RER trains, with two main differences: ticket inspectors tend to actually get on board of them, and you are supposed to use your ticket in order to go through the exit gates.\\n\\n== Hitching out ==\\n\\nThere are plenty of excellent spots for hitchhiking North (\\'\\'Aire La Courneuve\\'\\'), East ([[petrol station hitchhiking|petrol stations]] and \\'\\'[[péage|barrières de péage]]\\'\\') and also South (\\'\\'Aire de Lisses\\'\\'). It\\'s all about how much you are willing to pay in public transportation, and how daring you are.\\n\\n=== North/Northeast towards [[England]], [[Lille]] and [[Belgium]] {{afr|1}} ===\\n\\nThese are classified by cost in public transportation from Paris\\' centre.  There is a bonus pro-tip at the bottom involving Arras :)\\n\\n==== Option 1: Porte de la Chapelle ====\\n\\nThis option costs one local ticket. Porte de la Chapelle is where the A1 starts. Local drivers say they often see hitchhikers there. To get there, take the metro line 12 to Porte de la Chapelle, then walk to the roundabout. You can try getting a ride on the roundabout (there are traffic lights, which means that cars have to stop) or you can stand on the opposite side facing the roundabout where the motorway starts. Another good option is to start hitchhiking in the same street where the metro is. There are 2 petrol stations in that very street, just 50m deeper into the city. They aren\\'t overcrowded and, at the same time, quite a few cars going up north stop here to refill; nonetheless, at such places, much depends on your luck, and according to some hitchhikers, this place won\\'t make it to the top 10 best hitchhiking places in France. It is therefore recommended to hitchhike at the roundabout, where a quiet lane right by the traffic lights gives you a good opportunity to get onto the motorway (avoiding at the same time all the traffic that heads for Boulevard Peripherique).\\n\\nA good option to leave faster is to show at the roundabout a sign for the airport Charles de Gaulle. There is a petrol station (Aire La Courneuve - see Option 2) before the airport where the driver could let you out; don\\'t miss it! The station is not so big and many drivers just go to the airport but at least you can ask people, whereas it could be hard and long at Porte de la Chapelle.\\n\\n==== Option 2: Motorway services Aire La Courneuve ====\\n\\n[[File:Masaru.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Hitchhiker Masaru at \\'\\'Aire La Courneuve\\'\\']]\\n\\nThis option costs one local ticket or zones 1–3 ticket (eur 2.75as of 2018). The petrol station Aire de Service de La Courneuve is about 2\\xa0km along the A1, north of Paris. \\n\\nTake bus 150 from Porte de la Villette or bus 250 from Fort D\\'Aubervilliers (both are on metro line 7) to the stop Parc Des Sports. \\nThis bus stop is next to the A1 highway. Just walk to the right from the bus stop, without ever passing under the overpass. Then walk east parallel to the motorway through the parking lot of an apartment complex. There is a wall preventing access to the motorway, but if you continue walking a few hundred meters east and up a slight grassy hill, the wall ends. You can then follow a steep, thorny path full of nettles down towards the motorway and back west towards the petrol station. There is a fence right along the motorway, but near the petrol station it has been trampled down and you can step over it. (The hole in the fence is still here in february 2025.)\\n\\nYou may need to climb the fance \\n\\nFrom the petrol station, most drivers are only going to the airport or local communities. You should ask for a lift at least to the toll station (\\'\\'péage\\'\\') heading north. This is a 20-minute drive down the motorway (some kilometers after the airport) and everyone has to stop here.\\n\\nIn february 2025 there were indeed almost just local drivers, with many people going to Orly airport. There were few people going to Creil, which is a good options as there is another Aire/Motorway services on the way.\\n\\n==== Option 3: Charles de Gaulle ====\\n\\nCharles de Gaulle airport can be an option for hitching North-East, although waiting times might vary a lot.\\n\\nIt is easy to jump the metro at terminal 2 and there wasn\\'t anyone guarding it. Maybe the same is true for terminals 1 and 3 but I can\\'t vouch for it.\\n\\nFrom terminal 2 walk out of terminal and head straight to the main road. You should see signs for A1 Paris Lille. Keep following these signs until the road splits for A1 Lille. One road goes to the left, under a bridge and there are some traffic lights. The other goes to the right. Stand to the right of the right turn. Cars can stop on a dashed out area to your left or drive a little past you on the right. A couple of cars stopped straightaway and I was easily able to get a lift to the next service station which had lots of people driving north to Lille, Belgium and Holland. \\n\\n==== Option 4: Motorway services Aire de Vémars Est====\\n\\nFrom Nation bus station (also a metro stop) take bus 351 to Roissypole located at Charles De Gaulle Airport Terminal 3. It\\'s the last stop and payment isn\\'t required to enter the bus.You can BLACK RIDE on this bus both ways\\n\\nFrom the coach station there Gare Routière you can catch the 95.01 bus to Vémars. Ask inside at the ticket office/information desk for which parking number the bus will be at. The ticket costs €2. [BEWARE this bus does \\'\\'\\'not\\'\\'\\' run on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays / so if that is the case, then get off at Quebec because the A1 highway going to Lille cuts through Paris multiple times and at this petrol station there is a higher chance of finding Dutch cars stopping and giving you a ride to another petrol station on the main highway, which is super busy and easy to find rides going to anywhere from Calais to Antwerp to Lille]\\n\\nUpdate\\nAs at Saturday 1 July 2023\\nThe parking lot for the bus 95.01 is F1,and the bus does run on Saturdays also,according to the time table and confirmed by the driver \\n\\nYou can always try to go with the bus number 702 to Vémars centre from the airport (20 stops, 39 minutes). This will also work on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays. The parking lot for the bus 702 is B2.\\n\\nFrom the Vémars bus stop walk straight 400m on Rue Pierre Curie (D17) until it merges with Rue De la Mairie. Walk an additional 350 m until this merges with Rue Des Vignolles (D16)\\n\\nOn your left, the A1 will be clearly visible as will the Aire de Vémars Ouest petrol station. From here, it is another 1.25km to any given entrance.\\n\\n==== Option 5: Porte de Bagnolet (A3) ====\\nGoogle maps: [https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Porte+de+Bagnolet/@48.8649082,2.4086197,17z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x47e66e87e1c7d877:0x17c4d9a47ae58890!2sPorte+de+la+Chapelle!8m2!3d48.897279!4d2.359192!3m4!1s0x47e66d8329157e27:0x2a4ba9074d60ae9a!8m2!3d48.8645542!4d2.4095799]\\nGet a ticket for the station Porte de Bagnolet. This is pretty close to where the A3 starts, which leads to the A1, so a lot of traffic is heading this direction. The place might not be ideal, but it worked. There is a bus stop, where buses often stop so the traffic is slowed down, furthermore, there is a small gas stop, where you can approach drivers directly which cue up there from time to time. Position yourself at the traffic lights before the bus stop to show your sign indicating the direction you want to go to.\\n\\n\\n==== Bonus Tip: Arras Service Station====\\nHeading north on the A1, there is a fantastic AUTOGRILL Aire de Wancourt Est service station just outside Arras [https://goo.gl/maps/2suUznoe5C42], with people heading pretty much everywhere.  You can get rides to the UK (Chunnel), Lille, Belgium, Netherlands.  Many difference license plates (GB, F, B, NL, D, E) and lots of opportunities.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Metz]], [[Strasbourg]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Germany]] {{Afr|4}} ===\\n\\n==== Option 1. From within the city limits: Quai de Bercy ====\\n\\nCheap, as you will only need a metro ticket and pretty fast too.\\n\\nYou can also try to hitch directly from within Paris rather than taking the train for at least half an hour and then walking. \\n\\nTake the metro line 14 to Bercy and exit towards Boulevard de Bercy, take the Boulevard down to the bridge where it intersects with Quai de Bercy. Standing on Quai de Bercy it is advisable to have a sign indicating you want to get onto the A4. When cars stop, ask if they are going all the way to the toll station (péage), many drivers turn off the A4 before that but there are not really any convenient places to continue hitch-hiking from before the toll station.\\n\\nUpdate:\\n- currently line 14 is not working\\n- standing anywhere on the street following the direction of the arena (south east) is not really recommended, instead walk to the bridge Pont Charles de Gaulle: use a sign „A4“ and wait on the Quai de la Rapée just nearby the bridge, there is also space for cars to stop -> get a lift to the last petrol station before the toll station\\n-> A lot of cars from Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and France are stopping here (some going to or coming back from Disneyland ;))\\n\\n\\n\\n==== Option 2. Motorway junction slip-road ====\\n\\nThis one is close to Paris, faster and cheaper to get to, but still in the megapolis. Starting from there, you\\'re likely to end up either at the petrol station described below or at the péage. Not good at night.\\n\\nTake the RER Line A (Red) in the direction of Boissy St Legere until the station Nogent Sur Marne. Leave the station in direction of Rue Joinville and follow the sign to the A4. It is a 30 minute walk. There is a red light before the slip road (on-ramp). Lots of traffic, possibility to stop on the ramp for brave drivers.\\n\\nAsk if your driver can take you at least to the next petrol station Aire De Ferrières which is within the free motorway network. Gare de Péage de Coutevroult toll gate is a bit further.\\n\\n==== Option 3: Motorway service station Aire De Ferrières ====\\n\\nTake RER A to station Bussy-Saint-Georges. You can also get to this RER A station by taking bus 4 or 44 from metro station Gutenberg. Walk 2 km Avenue Marie Curie till Rue Pavée turn down until street crosses A4 highway and after this turn left rest stop is next to you. Right side from there is Decathlon Logistics France if you get lost\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'ATTENTION\\'\\'\\' \\nThe bridge leads into the forest and getting onto the motorway might be a bit difficult, the reason being that you have to squeeze yourself to be able to pass through the narrow space between the bridge and the fence.Moreover,you have to descend onto the motorway through an overgrown grass.An alternative is to take bus 46 \\xa0at Busy-Saint-Georges station in the direction of Gare de Val d\\'Europe,or same bus at Gare de Val d\\'Europe in the direction of Torcy(this is important because the bus is infrequent and might be useful to catch it at the other side if wait time is long).From Bussy-Saint-Georges you\\'ll ride 4 stops and from Gare de Val d\\'Europe, 5 stops,alight at Bout Pêcheret and walk back in the direction the bus came from if you took it from Bussy-Saint-Georges and vice-versa. Continue walking on the [[D10]] road to cross the motorway and turn right on the road leading directly to the service station.\\n\\n=== Getting South or Southwest {{Afr|6}}, {{Afr|10}}, or {{Afr|11}} ===\\n\\nThese spots are close enough to the city to be getting traffic in all southern directions.\\n\\n==== Option 1: Porte d\\'Orléans ====\\n\\nOnce the most famous hitchhiking spot in France, this spot isn\\'t bad nowadays, but it isn\\'t great either. The good thing is that drivers aren\\'t surprised to see people there, and that you don\\'t need to get out of Paris in faraway suburbs. \\n\\nPorte d\\'Orléans is the terminal subway station of line 4. There is an entry on the \\'\\'périphérique\\'\\' ring road where lots of people are later heading South. The best place is besides the \"Novotel\" building or (better) opposite it at the traffic lights. Be warned, traffic here is heavy and fast moving. If you have much baggage or more than one person I would not fancy your chances here.  Waiting at the petrol station or even the adjacent war memorial will not give you the best traffic.\\n\\nNote : I think that the place in front of the hotel is pretty bad. Very hard for the cars to stop there. It\\'s better to stand before, at the red lights. I stood near the gas station at the lights, you miss all the cars not coming from inside Paris, but it\\'s way easier for the cars to see you and to stop.\\n\\nMake sure to specify with a sign specifying that you go to Orléans or Chartres (if you are heading Southwest - A10 or A11), and that the driver will leave you at least at the péage de Saint Arnoult or before that at Limours-Janvry service station. Beware, just after the \"péage\", the motorway separates between A10 and A11. If you are heading directly South onto the A6, have a sign (you may try Lyon or Fontainebleau) and make sure to be left at Aire De Lisses rest stop, roughly 35 km further, a little bit after Evry (drivers to Evry are not enough for you).\\n\\n==== Option 2: Porte d\\'Italie ====\\n\\nSimilarly Porte d\\'Italie which is not far from Porte d\\'Orleans is a good place to hitch from. Additionally if you walk down the exit to the traffic lights, there is an overhead bypass which can keep you dry in the rain.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Lyon]], [[Marseille]], [[Barcelona]], [[Italy]] {{Afr|6}} ===\\n\\n==== Option 1: Motorway services Aire De Lisses ====\\n\\nThis option costs EUR 5.85 (but possible to have ride without ticket also), a zone 1–5 ticket and takes roughly 75 minutes. Aire de Lisses is the first service area on the A6, situated about 35 km South of Paris. It can save you time because you avoid all outbound traffic not really heading your direction, being located after all the motorway branch-offs.\\n\\nGet the RER D towards Melun via Corbeil. Be careful to get on the right train as there are 2 routes for RER D towards Melun. Tthe ID of the train you need was ZIP or ZOP (All trains on RER lines have a 4 letter ID depending on stations served). If it\\'s too confusing get whatever train that goes to Corbeil Essonne and from there, whatever train that goes to Melun. Get off at the station Gare de Villabé the second after Corbeil-Essonnes. \\n\\nOtherwise, you can take the RER D to Évry-Courcouronnes Centre, and from their Bus 415^ in direction of Villabé. Get off at stop Ikea the gas station will be a five minute walk away. There is a fence that it looks like you’ll have to climb from the road, but a goat trail to its immediate right leads to a section of the fence that has been removed and allows access to the rest stop.\\n\\n^NOTE: As of October 2024 there is construction at the Évry-Courcouronnes Centre Station, specifically the upper-floor bus bays from where the 415 will usually depart. There is no signage directing you to its correct bus bay (and asking an employee in broken French led first to //very// erroneous directions for [[User:Movethathoof|Movethathoof]]). It is supposed to depart from Bay G, to the far right against the concrete wall as seen when exiting the station and facing the surface bus loop. An alternative bus to take is the 4307, departing from the Bay D, which will leave you across the D26 from the IKEA.\\n\\nNote: There is no barrier at Villabé and so you can pay the standard central Paris fare to get into the metro network and then just ride out there.\\n\\n==== Option 2: Motorway services Aire de Nemours ====\\n\\nYou can take a train to Nemours Saint Pierre (transilien R from Gare de Lyon, a ticket costs about 10 euros) and walk 45min to the AUTOGRILL Aire de Nemours A6 service area / Shell fuel station. Then you\\'re already on a paying section (no local traffic), far out from Paris (80km), and can get a ride to Châlon, Mâcon or Lyon in a few minutes.\\n\\n\\n=== South-West to [[Orléans|Orleans]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Spain]] {{afr|10}} & West to [[Le Mans]], [[Nantes]], [[Rennes]], [[Bretagne|Brittany]] {{afr|11}} ===\\n\\nThe A10 and A11 motorways follow the route of the \\'\\'\\'A6\\'\\'\\' (see above) from Paris, and split from it near Antony/Rungis. Then, before the A10 and the A11 split up, there is the service station of Limours-Janvry near Briis-sous-Forges and a [[péage]] near St-Arnoult, 40 km Southwest of Paris. Whichever spot you choose, ask the driver to take you at least until the Limours-Janvry service station or the péage of St-Arnoult. From these places, you can find a driver who takes you on the A10 or the A11 depending on which way you want to go.\\n\\n==== Option 1: Pont de Sevres ====\\n\\n[[File:ParisOut.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Hitching after the bridge]]\\n\\nThis option costs the price of an underground ticket. It takes you to the beginning of the N118 road which connects to the A10-A11 in about 25 km.\\n\\nTake the subway 9 to Pont De Sevres, its end station. You start walking towards the bridge, where you can see the signs towards Nantes, Bordeaux, etc. The hitchhiking spot is just before the bridge, at the red lights. You can try with the cars coming from the direction of the metro station, and also with the cars which came along the river and are turning left to get to the bridge.\\n\\n==== Option 2: Motorway junction Massy Palaiseau ====\\n\\nThis option costs Eur 4.90, a ticket for zones 1-4. This option is useful to get out of the ring roads and get directly on the A10 after all the branch-offs.\\n\\nTake RER B to Massey-Palaiseau station. Walk down Avenue Carnot along the Massy-Palaiseau railway towards the \\'\\'autoroute\\'\\'. After a while there you will see a long stretch of a road with lots of space for cars. Keep going and you will reach a roundabout. If you keep following this road, you will reach the  motorway entrance underneath a bridge. Make sure to get a ride to the first \\'\\'barrière de péage\\'\\' (30+ km) at St-Arnoult or to the Limours-Janvry service station 5 km down the road.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Edit July 2022\\'\\'\\' this does not work! There is pretty much zero car traffic, at least when I was there. If you\\'re starting in Massy-Palaiseau you\\'re better off thumbing at [https://goo.gl/maps/bbD5WGkiKeFqSFzBA this roundabout]. I didn\\'t wait too long here and got a ride straight to Le Mans.\\n\\n==== Option 3: Motorway service station Limours-Janvry ====\\n\\nThe first service station on the motorway is called Limours-Janvry and it is situated 2kms northeast of the village Briis-sous-Forges. To get there you need to take RER B to Massy-Palaiseau. From there take bus 91.03 to Briis-sous-Forges. It runs about 3 times an hour on weekdays, once an hour on Saturdays, and there are no buses on Sundays. Then walk northeast along the small local road Route D\\'Invilliers.\\n\\nBriis-sous-Forges to the petrol station [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=D131&daddr=Aire+de+Service+de+Limours-Janvry&geocode=FT3X5QIdxnEgAA%3BFZke5gIdK7wgAA&hl=en&mra=ltm&dirflg=w&sll=48.64455,2.16575&sspn=0.115917,0.338173&ie=UTF8&ll=48.626839,2.135124&spn=0.028989,0.084543&t=h&z=14  map]\\n\\n\\n==== Option 4: Péage de Saint-Arnoult ====\\n\\nYou can take the RER C train to Dourdan. There are no controls on the exit, so if you are on the cheap, you need to pay only the basic metro ticket (some EUR 1.33) to get into the underground network in Paris. Once in Dourdan, cross the railroad track and turn left and then go straight on the D836 until you reach the péage after 4-5 kilometers. You should be able to hitch a car as there are many passing by and the French take easily on small routes if they see you walking. Get off just after the road crosses the autoroute, go left and in a short while, you will reach the péage. Look at the map beforehand! You have much higher chances here then anywhere else, there are lots of cars going through.\\n\\n=== West towards Rouen, Le Havre, Caen {{Afr|13}} ===\\n\\n==== Inside Paris ====\\n\\nQuai André Citroën, under the ring road overpass. A lot of traffic on Fridays and Saturdays as many inhabitants of the 15th and 7th arrondissements go to Normandy for the weekend. As a result, this spot is very effective on these days (20 to 30 min on average) but much worse at other times (expect to wait one and half hours).\\n\\nPorte d\\'Auteuil, at the last traffic light to the entrance of the A13, or even right under the \"no pedestrians\" sign on the shoulder to the motorway just after the light, where cars haven\\'t picked up much speed yet and can see you well. Ask drivers to take you (at least) to Morainvilliers petrol station in Poissy.\\n\\n==== In the suburbs ====\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\' Autoroute A13 Gare de Péage de Buchelay toll\\n\\nTake Transilien J suburban train from Saint-Lazare station. The fare is €8 but you may not be controlled. Get off in  (not Mantes Station). There\\'s a 30 minute walk to the toll gate. You can search Innovaparc bus stop place is next to there\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\' South Area Morainvilliers rest area\\n\\nTake Transilien J or RER A from Paris and get off at Poissy. Take bus 20 to bus stop Auberg. There\\'s one bus every hour on weekdays, fewer than that on Saturdays and it doesn\\'t run on Sundays.\\n\\n== Airports ==\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'[[Charles de Gaulle airport]]\\'\\'\\' / \\'\\'\\'[[Orly airport]]\\'\\'\\' / \\'\\'\\'[[Beauvais]]\\'\\'\\' airport\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n{{Cities France}}\\n{{Excellent}}\\n{{IsIn|France}}\\n\\n[[Category:Europe]]\\n[[Category:France]]\\n[[Category:E5]]\\n[[Category:E15]]\\n[[Category:E19]]\\n[[Category:E50]]\\n[[Category:E54]]\\n\\n[[de:Paris]]\\n[[es:Paris]]\\n[[fr:Paris]]\\n[[nl:Parijs]]',\n",

It is situated within a ring road called \\'\\'le périphérique\\'\\', or \\'\\'le périph\\'\\'. The actual city is relatively small, but is surrounded by endless suburbs, which are linked to the urban public transportation system at no extra cost, as since January 2025 the Metro and the RER (suburban trains, not to be confused with Transilien trains) have a unified fare system.\\n\\nNote that there is an \"outer ring road\" to the Paris suburb area, motorway A86 (or \\'\\'super-périphérique\\'\\') and another wider ring even further called \"la Francillienne\" which isn\\'t completed but still used to connect . If your ride is not going to Paris itself, you might want to clarify which ring they are going to take as it may affect the place where you\\'d want to be dropped. You may also find them useful if you need to bypass Paris, especially the Francilienne, as it has more gas stations and less complex interchanges.\\n\\nGood to know if you\\'re starting to stink up in the City of Lights: the Municipality provides [https://www.paris.fr/pages/les-bains-douches-municipaux-138 free shower facilities ] in 17 locations around Paris. Note they are BYOT (bring your own toiletry).\\n\\n[[File:888_signs.jpg|thumb|240px|right|A small collection of the \"Paris\" signs for the [[Project 888]] where over 150 hitchhikers gathered and camped in front of the Eiffel Tower.]]\\n\\n== Hitching in ==\\n\\nDuring rush hours, it is possible (but illegal) to be quickly dropped on the ring road. This is useful if your ride is not willing to get out of it to drop you (which is often the case). Within the ring area, you are definitely linked to the whole regular fare subway system.\\n\\nIf you are coming from the Northeast and your ride is heading South (which is a normal truck route), chances are that your driver will not drop you on the ring road where it is complicated to stop. A frequent place to get dropped is the first exit South on the A6 called \"Rungis\". From there, you can reach the Metropolitan subway system by tram with one ticket, then use another one to your final destination. You can also reach other suburbs in the 94 department (Val de Marne) taking the TvM bus, which is also a normal Paris ticket.\\n\\n== Getting around ==\\n\\nIf you need to use the Metro and don\\'t want to pay for an ever more exorbitantly priced ticket (€2.50 now!): [https://paris-luttes.info/IMG/pdf/bahalorspageparpage-2.pdf here] is a detailed guide on blackriding. It\\'s in French but here are some main takeaways:\\n* An easy way to get in is to stand in front of an exit gate and reach your arm to the sensor on the other side to trigger its opening (as illustrated in the guide)\\n* Otherwise, the main types of entrance gates are:\\n# Turnstile with a half-gate behind it: wait for someone to pass so that the half-gate is open and is slowly closing, jump over the turnstile or sneak under it, go through the space left open (easier if you\\'re skinny)\\n# Short glass doors: literally just push them forward with a bit of force. Genius move by the RATP who are expanding this type to more and more stations.\\n# Tall glass doors: these are tricky. Find another type or use an exit gate.\\n* Be careful to avoid busy stations with 3 lines or more (Châtelet, République, Nation, the main train stations, etc) as ticket inspectors tend to concentrate there, but you can get always get a bad surprise. They congregate at corridor angles where they can\\'t be seen ahead of time, so keep an eye out for foot traffic that is slowing in front of you, or voices saying things like \"contrôle des titres de transport, s\\'il vous plaît\".\\n\\nThe same goes for RER trains, with two main differences: ticket inspectors tend to actually get on board of them, and you are supposed to use your ticket in order to go through the exit gates.\\n\\n== Hitching out ==\\n\\nThere are plenty of excellent spots for hitchhiking North (\\'\\'Aire La Courneuve\\'\\'), East ([[petrol station hitchhiking|petrol stations]] and \\'\\'[[péage|barrières de péage]]\\'\\') and also South (\\'\\'Aire de Lisses\\'\\'). It\\'s all about how much you are willing to pay in public transportation, and how daring you are.\\n\\n=== North/Northeast towards [[England]], [[Lille]] and [[Belgium]] {{afr|1}} ===\\n\\nThese are classified by cost in public transportation from Paris\\' centre.  There is a bonus pro-tip at the bottom involving Arras :)\\n\\n==== Option 1: Porte de la Chapelle ====\\n\\nThis option costs one local ticket. Porte de la Chapelle is where the A1 starts. Local drivers say they often see hitchhikers there. To get there, take the metro line 12 to Porte de la Chapelle, then walk to the roundabout. You can try getting a ride on the roundabout (there are traffic lights, which means that cars have to stop) or you can stand on the opposite side facing the roundabout where the motorway starts. Another good option is to start hitchhiking in the same street where the metro is. There are 2 petrol stations in that very street, just 50m deeper into the city. They aren\\'t overcrowded and, at the same time, quite a few cars going up north stop here to refill; nonetheless, at such places, much depends on your luck, and according to some hitchhikers, this place won\\'t make it to the top 10 best hitchhiking places in France. It is therefore recommended to hitchhike at the roundabout, where a quiet lane right by the traffic lights gives you a good opportunity to get onto the motorway (avoiding at the same time all the traffic that heads for Boulevard Peripherique).\\n\\nA good option to leave faster is to show at the roundabout a sign for the airport Charles de Gaulle. There is a petrol station (Aire La Courneuve - see Option 2) before the airport where the driver could let you out; don\\'t miss it! The station is not so big and many drivers just go to the airport but at least you can ask people, whereas it could be hard and long at Porte de la Chapelle.\\n\\n==== Option 2: Motorway services Aire La Courneuve ====\\n\\n[[File:Masaru.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Hitchhiker Masaru at \\'\\'Aire La Courneuve\\'\\']]\\n\\nThis option costs one local ticket or zones 1–3 ticket (eur 2.75as of 2018). The petrol station Aire de Service de La Courneuve is about 2\\xa0km along the A1, north of Paris. \\n\\nTake bus 150 from Porte de la Villette or bus 250 from Fort D\\'Aubervilliers (both are on metro line 7) to the stop Parc Des Sports. \\nThis bus stop is next to the A1 highway. Just walk to the right from the bus stop, without ever passing under the overpass. Then walk east parallel to the motorway through the parking lot of an apartment complex. There is a wall preventing access to the motorway, but if you continue walking a few hundred meters east and up a slight grassy hill, the wall ends. You can then follow a steep, thorny path full of nettles down towards the motorway and back west towards the petrol station. There is a fence right along the motorway, but near the petrol station it has been trampled down and you can step over it. (The hole in the fence is still here in february 2025.)\\n\\nYou may need to climb the fance \\n\\nFrom the petrol station, most drivers are only going to the airport or local communities. You should ask for a lift at least to the toll station (\\'\\'péage\\'\\') heading north. This is a 20-minute drive down the motorway (some kilometers after the airport) and everyone has to stop here.\\n\\nIn february 2025 there were indeed almost just local drivers, with many people going to Orly airport. There were few people going to Creil, which is a good options as there is another Aire/Motorway services on the way.\\n\\n==== Option 3: Charles de Gaulle ====\\n\\nCharles de Gaulle airport can be an option for hitching North-East, although waiting times might vary a lot.\\n\\nIt is easy to jump the metro at terminal 2 and there wasn\\'t anyone guarding it. Maybe the same is true for terminals 1 and 3 but I can\\'t vouch for it.\\n\\nFrom terminal 2 walk out of terminal and head straight to the main road. You should see signs for A1 Paris Lille. Keep following these signs until the road splits for A1 Lille. One road goes to the left, under a bridge and there are some traffic lights. The other goes to the right. Stand to the right of the right turn. Cars can stop on a dashed out area to your left or drive a little past you on the right. A couple of cars stopped straightaway and I was easily able to get a lift to the next service station which had lots of people driving north to Lille, Belgium and Holland. \\n\\n==== Option 4: Motorway services Aire de Vémars Est====\\n\\nFrom Nation bus station (also a metro stop) take bus 351 to Roissypole located at Charles De Gaulle Airport Terminal 3. It\\'s the last stop and payment isn\\'t required to enter the bus.You can BLACK RIDE on this bus both ways\\n\\nFrom the coach station there Gare Routière you can catch the 95.01 bus to Vémars. Ask inside at the ticket office/information desk for which parking number the bus will be at. The ticket costs €2. [BEWARE this bus does \\'\\'\\'not\\'\\'\\' run on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays / so if that is the case, then get off at Quebec because the A1 highway going to Lille cuts through Paris multiple times and at this petrol station there is a higher chance of finding Dutch cars stopping and giving you a ride to another petrol station on the main highway, which is super busy and easy to find rides going to anywhere from Calais to Antwerp to Lille]\\n\\nUpdate\\nAs at Saturday 1 July 2023\\nThe parking lot for the bus 95.01 is F1,and the bus does run on Saturdays also,according to the time table and confirmed by the driver \\n\\nYou can always try to go with the bus number 702 to Vémars centre from the airport (20 stops, 39 minutes). This will also work on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays. The parking lot for the bus 702 is B2.\\n\\nFrom the Vémars bus stop walk straight 400m on Rue Pierre Curie (D17) until it merges with Rue De la Mairie. Walk an additional 350 m until this merges with Rue Des Vignolles (D16)\\n\\nOn your left, the A1 will be clearly visible as will the Aire de Vémars Ouest petrol station. From here, it is another 1.25km to any given entrance.\\n\\n==== Option 5: Porte de Bagnolet (A3) ====\\nGoogle maps: [https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Porte+de+Bagnolet/@48.8649082,2.4086197,17z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x47e66e87e1c7d877:0x17c4d9a47ae58890!2sPorte+de+la+Chapelle!8m2!3d48.897279!4d2.359192!3m4!1s0x47e66d8329157e27:0x2a4ba9074d60ae9a!8m2!3d48.8645542!4d2.4095799]\\nGet a ticket for the station Porte de Bagnolet. This is pretty close to where the A3 starts, which leads to the A1, so a lot of traffic is heading this direction. The place might not be ideal, but it worked. There is a bus stop, where buses often stop so the traffic is slowed down, furthermore, there is a small gas stop, where you can approach drivers directly which cue up there from time to time. Position yourself at the traffic lights before the bus stop to show your sign indicating the direction you want to go to.\\n\\n\\n==== Bonus Tip: Arras Service Station====\\nHeading north on the A1, there is a fantastic AUTOGRILL Aire de Wancourt Est service station just outside Arras [{{Coords|50.2619333|2.8593804}}], with people heading pretty much everywhere.  You can get rides to the UK (Chunnel), Lille, Belgium, Netherlands.  Many difference license plates (GB, F, B, NL, D, E) and lots of opportunities.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Metz]], [[Strasbourg]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Germany]] {{Afr|4}} ===\\n\\n==== Option 1. From within the city limits: Quai de Bercy ====\\n\\nCheap, as you will only need a metro ticket and pretty fast too.\\n\\nYou can also try to hitch directly from within Paris rather than taking the train for at least half an hour and then walking. \\n\\nTake the metro line 14 to Bercy and exit towards Boulevard de Bercy, take the Boulevard down to the bridge where it intersects with Quai de Bercy. Standing on Quai de Bercy it is advisable to have a sign indicating you want to get onto the A4. When cars stop, ask if they are going all the way to the toll station (péage), many drivers turn off the A4 before that but there are not really any convenient places to continue hitch-hiking from before the toll station.\\n\\nUpdate:\\n- currently line 14 is not working\\n- standing anywhere on the street following the direction of the arena (south east) is not really recommended, instead walk to the bridge Pont Charles de Gaulle: use a sign „A4“ and wait on the Quai de la Rapée just nearby the bridge, there is also space for cars to stop -> get a lift to the last petrol station before the toll station\\n-> A lot of cars from Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and France are stopping here (some going to or coming back from Disneyland ;))\\n\\n\\n\\n==== Option 2. Motorway junction slip-road ====\\n\\nThis one is close to Paris, faster and cheaper to get to, but still in the megapolis. Starting from there, you\\'re likely to end up either at the petrol station described below or at the péage. Not good at night.\\n\\nTake the RER Line A (Red) in the direction of Boissy St Legere until the station Nogent Sur Marne. Leave the station in direction of Rue Joinville and follow the sign to the A4. It is a 30 minute walk. There is a red light before the slip road (on-ramp). Lots of traffic, possibility to stop on the ramp for brave drivers.\\n\\nAsk if your driver can take you at least to the next petrol station Aire De Ferrières which is within the free motorway network. Gare de Péage de Coutevroult toll gate is a bit further.\\n\\n==== Option 3: Motorway service station Aire De Ferrières ====\\n\\nTake RER A to station Bussy-Saint-Georges. You can also get to this RER A station by taking bus 4 or 44 from metro station Gutenberg. Walk 2 km Avenue Marie Curie till Rue Pavée turn down until street crosses A4 highway and after this turn left rest stop is next to you. Right side from there is Decathlon Logistics France if you get lost\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'ATTENTION\\'\\'\\' \\nThe bridge leads into the forest and getting onto the motorway might be a bit difficult, the reason being that you have to squeeze yourself to be able to pass through the narrow space between the bridge and the fence.Moreover,you have to descend onto the motorway through an overgrown grass.An alternative is to take bus 46 \\xa0at Busy-Saint-Georges station in the direction of Gare de Val d\\'Europe,or same bus at Gare de Val d\\'Europe in the direction of Torcy(this is important because the bus is infrequent and might be useful to catch it at the other side if wait time is long).From Bussy-Saint-Georges you\\'ll ride 4 stops and from Gare de Val d\\'Europe, 5 stops,alight at Bout Pêcheret and walk back in the direction the bus came from if you took it from Bussy-Saint-Georges and vice-versa. Continue walking on the [[D10]] road to cross the motorway and turn right on the road leading directly to the service station.\\n\\n=== Getting South or Southwest {{Afr|6}}, {{Afr|10}}, or {{Afr|11}} ===\\n\\nThese spots are close enough to the city to be getting traffic in all southern directions.\\n\\n==== Option 1: Porte d\\'Orléans ====\\n\\nOnce the most famous hitchhiking spot in France, this spot isn\\'t bad nowadays, but it isn\\'t great either. The good thing is that drivers aren\\'t surprised to see people there, and that you don\\'t need to get out of Paris in faraway suburbs. \\n\\nPorte d\\'Orléans is the terminal subway station of line 4. There is an entry on the \\'\\'périphérique\\'\\' ring road where lots of people are later heading South. The best place is besides the \"Novotel\" building or (better) opposite it at the traffic lights. Be warned, traffic here is heavy and fast moving. If you have much baggage or more than one person I would not fancy your chances here.  Waiting at the petrol station or even the adjacent war memorial will not give you the best traffic.\\n\\nNote : I think that the place in front of the hotel is pretty bad. Very hard for the cars to stop there. It\\'s better to stand before, at the red lights. I stood near the gas station at the lights, you miss all the cars not coming from inside Paris, but it\\'s way easier for the cars to see you and to stop.\\n\\nMake sure to specify with a sign specifying that you go to Orléans or Chartres (if you are heading Southwest - A10 or A11), and that the driver will leave you at least at the péage de Saint Arnoult or before that at Limours-Janvry service station. Beware, just after the \"péage\", the motorway separates between A10 and A11. If you are heading directly South onto the A6, have a sign (you may try Lyon or Fontainebleau) and make sure to be left at Aire De Lisses rest stop, roughly 35 km further, a little bit after Evry (drivers to Evry are not enough for you).\\n\\n==== Option 2: Porte d\\'Italie ====\\n\\nSimilarly Porte d\\'Italie which is not far from Porte d\\'Orleans is a good place to hitch from. Additionally if you walk down the exit to the traffic lights, there is an overhead bypass which can keep you dry in the rain.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Lyon]], [[Marseille]], [[Barcelona]], [[Italy]] {{Afr|6}} ===\\n\\n==== Option 1: Motorway services Aire De Lisses ====\\n\\nThis option costs EUR 5.85 (but possible to have ride without ticket also), a zone 1–5 ticket and takes roughly 75 minutes. Aire de Lisses is the first service area on the A6, situated about 35 km South of Paris. It can save you time because you avoid all outbound traffic not really heading your direction, being located after all the motorway branch-offs.\\n\\nGet the RER D towards Melun via Corbeil. Be careful to get on the right train as there are 2 routes for RER D towards Melun. Tthe ID of the train you need was ZIP or ZOP (All trains on RER lines have a 4 letter ID depending on stations served). If it\\'s too confusing get whatever train that goes to Corbeil Essonne and from there, whatever train that goes to Melun. Get off at the station Gare de Villabé the second after Corbeil-Essonnes. \\n\\nOtherwise, you can take the RER D to Évry-Courcouronnes Centre, and from their Bus 415^ in direction of Villabé. Get off at stop Ikea the gas station will be a five minute walk away. There is a fence that it looks like you’ll have to climb from the road, but a goat trail to its immediate right leads to a section of the fence that has been removed and allows access to the rest stop.\\n\\n^NOTE: As of October 2024 there is construction at the Évry-Courcouronnes Centre Station, specifically the upper-floor bus bays from where the 415 will usually depart. There is no signage directing you to its correct bus bay (and asking an employee in broken French led first to //very// erroneous directions for [[User:Movethathoof|Movethathoof]]). It is supposed to depart from Bay G, to the far right against the concrete wall as seen when exiting the station and facing the surface bus loop. An alternative bus to take is the 4307, departing from the Bay D, which will leave you across the D26 from the IKEA.\\n\\nNote: There is no barrier at Villabé and so you can pay the standard central Paris fare to get into the metro network and then just ride out there.\\n\\n==== Option 2: Motorway services Aire de Nemours ====\\n\\nYou can take a train to Nemours Saint Pierre (transilien R from Gare de Lyon, a ticket costs about 10 euros) and walk 45min to the AUTOGRILL Aire de Nemours A6 service area / Shell fuel station. Then you\\'re already on a paying section (no local traffic), far out from Paris (80km), and can get a ride to Châlon, Mâcon or Lyon in a few minutes.\\n\\n\\n=== South-West to [[Orléans|Orleans]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Spain]] {{afr|10}} & West to [[Le Mans]], [[Nantes]], [[Rennes]], [[Bretagne|Brittany]] {{afr|11}} ===\\n\\nThe A10 and A11 motorways follow the route of the \\'\\'\\'A6\\'\\'\\' (see above) from Paris, and split from it near Antony/Rungis. Then, before the A10 and the A11 split up, there is the service station of Limours-Janvry near Briis-sous-Forges and a [[péage]] near St-Arnoult, 40 km Southwest of Paris. Whichever spot you choose, ask the driver to take you at least until the Limours-Janvry service station or the péage of St-Arnoult. From these places, you can find a driver who takes you on the A10 or the A11 depending on which way you want to go.\\n\\n==== Option 1: Pont de Sevres ====\\n\\n[[File:ParisOut.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Hitching after the bridge]]\\n\\nThis option costs the price of an underground ticket. It takes you to the beginning of the N118 road which connects to the A10-A11 in about 25 km.\\n\\nTake the subway 9 to Pont De Sevres, its end station. You start walking towards the bridge, where you can see the signs towards Nantes, Bordeaux, etc. The hitchhiking spot is just before the bridge, at the red lights. You can try with the cars coming from the direction of the metro station, and also with the cars which came along the river and are turning left to get to the bridge.\\n\\n==== Option 2: Motorway junction Massy Palaiseau ====\\n\\nThis option costs Eur 4.90, a ticket for zones 1-4. This option is useful to get out of the ring roads and get directly on the A10 after all the branch-offs.\\n\\nTake RER B to Massey-Palaiseau station. Walk down Avenue Carnot along the Massy-Palaiseau railway towards the \\'\\'autoroute\\'\\'. After a while there you will see a long stretch of a road with lots of space for cars. Keep going and you will reach a roundabout. If you keep following this road, you will reach the  motorway entrance underneath a bridge. Make sure to get a ride to the first \\'\\'barrière de péage\\'\\' (30+ km) at St-Arnoult or to the Limours-Janvry service station 5 km down the road.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Edit July 2022\\'\\'\\' this does not work! There is pretty much zero car traffic, at least when I was there. If you\\'re starting in Massy-Palaiseau you\\'re better off thumbing at [https://goo.gl/maps/bbD5WGkiKeFqSFzBA this roundabout]. I didn\\'t wait too long here and got a ride straight to Le Mans.\\n\\n==== Option 3: Motorway service station Limours-Janvry ====\\n\\nThe first service station on the motorway is called Limours-Janvry and it is situated 2kms northeast of the village Briis-sous-Forges. To get there you need to take RER B to Massy-Palaiseau. From there take bus 91.03 to Briis-sous-Forges. It runs about 3 times an hour on weekdays, once an hour on Saturdays, and there are no buses on Sundays. Then walk northeast along the small local road Route D\\'Invilliers.\\n\\nBriis-sous-Forges to the petrol station [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=D131&daddr=Aire+de+Service+de+Limours-Janvry&geocode=FT3X5QIdxnEgAA%3BFZke5gIdK7wgAA&hl=en&mra=ltm&dirflg=w&sll=48.64455,2.16575&sspn=0.115917,0.338173&ie=UTF8&ll=48.626839,2.135124&spn=0.028989,0.084543&t=h&z=14  map]\\n\\n\\n==== Option 4: Péage de Saint-Arnoult ====\\n\\nYou can take the RER C train to Dourdan. There are no controls on the exit, so if you are on the cheap, you need to pay only the basic metro ticket (some EUR 1.33) to get into the underground network in Paris. Once in Dourdan, cross the railroad track and turn left and then go straight on the D836 until you reach the péage after 4-5 kilometers. You should be able to hitch a car as there are many passing by and the French take easily on small routes if they see you walking. Get off just after the road crosses the autoroute, go left and in a short while, you will reach the péage. Look at the map beforehand! You have much higher chances here then anywhere else, there are lots of cars going through.\\n\\n=== West towards Rouen, Le Havre, Caen {{Afr|13}} ===\\n\\n==== Inside Paris ====\\n\\nQuai André Citroën, under the ring road overpass. A lot of traffic on Fridays and Saturdays as many inhabitants of the 15th and 7th arrondissements go to Normandy for the weekend. As a result, this spot is very effective on these days (20 to 30 min on average) but much worse at other times (expect to wait one and half hours).\\n\\nPorte d\\'Auteuil, at the last traffic light to the entrance of the A13, or even right under the \"no pedestrians\" sign on the shoulder to the motorway just after the light, where cars haven\\'t picked up much speed yet and can see you well. Ask drivers to take you (at least) to Morainvilliers petrol station in Poissy.\\n\\n==== In the suburbs ====\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\' Autoroute A13 Gare de Péage de Buchelay toll\\n\\nTake Transilien J suburban train from Saint-Lazare station. The fare is €8 but you may not be controlled. Get off in  (not Mantes Station). There\\'s a 30 minute walk to the toll gate. You can search Innovaparc bus stop place is next to there\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\' South Area Morainvilliers rest area\\n\\nTake Transilien J or RER A from Paris and get off at Poissy. Take bus 20 to bus stop Auberg.

It's a great, chilled out alternative to the bustling cities of the east coast, with a great original music scene and some beautiful beaches. The travelers, gypsies and vagabond mecca of Perth is the small port city of [[Fremantle]], located about 30km from the CBD on the coast. (''CBD'' means Central business district, the Ozzie term for city center). Bear in mind that anywhere north of Perth is getting into desert country. Take plenty of water and know where you're going!\\n\\n# Residents\\n\\nThese hitchhikers are currently located in Perth, and may be willing to offer tips or accompany you on your first hitchhike:\\n\\n* https://hitchwiki.org/en/User:Balupton\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n\\nGetting out of Perth is easy. The people in WA are generally more relaxed, friendly and trusting than folks on the east coast, which makes it a great place to hitchhike. Whether it's a short trip around the South-West forests and beaches, a full blown stint across the Nullarbor to Adelaide or an escape north to Broome or Darwin for the winter, it is usually less than half an hour's wait until your first ride out of Perth. As with any city, the trick is to get as far out of town as you can using the local public transport (Perth has a train network that will take you to within cooee of all the good hitching spots). Once you're at the spot, it's usually just a hop, skip and a jump or the straight and narrow to your next destination. Check out Perth on the [http://maps.hitchwiki.org Hitchwiki Map] for some good spots.\\n\\n\\n=== To Southwest Region (Bunbury, Busselton, Margaret River, Pemberton) ===\\n\\nTo get down to the southwest along the coast, take the train from Perth to Mandurah (if leaving from Fremantle, catch the 99 bus to the Murdoch train station and go to Mandurah from there). Once in Mandurah, walk out of the station and catch the 594 bus south at B4 platform (you can use the same ticket you had on the train) to the Miami Bakehouse (just ask the driver). They have really good pies, and there is a great hitching spot only about 500m south on the highway, with a big pullout onto some gravel.\\n\\nNote: They recently opened the Perth-Bunbury highway extending from the freeway, which means there is less traffic heading through Mandurah, however I have hitched it since the opening, and still only waited 20 minutes for a ride!\\n\\n\\n=== South to Albany ===\\n\\nTake the train all the way to Armadale. From Armadale train station, walk about a kilometre up the hill to the Albany Hwy/Southwestern Hwy junction (also a good alternative to get south to Bunbury via Pinjarra/Harvey along the Southwestern Hwy if you wanted). Walk about 200m up the Albany Hwy until you get to the small pulloff before the hill. See [http://maps.hitchwiki.org map] for exact spot.\\n\\n\\n=== North ===\\n\\nThis will be a big hitch, no matter where you're headed. It can take 3-4 days to get to Broome in a car. Trucks will probably be a better option. Whether your first stop is Geraldton on the coast, or Meekatharra (I hope it isn't!) on the inland highway, it will be at least 5-6 hours, possibly more, before you arrive anywhere. Take plenty of supplies (food, water...etc) and be prepared to start out early, or not at all. \\n\\n'''Option 1'''\\n\\nTake the train all the way to Midland. Then catch either the 310 or 311 bus and ask the driver to drop you at the big truck stop. These buses only leave early in the morning (around 8am), so make sure to check on the [http://www.transperth.wa.gov.au Transperth Website] for the timetables and get there early so you don't miss them! Plenty of trucks and cars fuel up at this stop, and there's even a good spot to stand on the road (if there is two of you, one can be asking at the servo while the other is thumbing on the road). You'll need to find out if your ride is heading up the coast (Brand Hwy), or inland (Great Northern Hwy), as these are two very different routes. If you just want to get north quick (to [[Broome]] or [[Darwin]]), try to get rides in trucks heading up the Great Northern, as this will cut a few hundred kilometres off the trip, however if you want to take the scenic route up the coast (Monkey Mia, Coral Bay, Exmouth) make sure to get in with someone heading to Geraldton.\\n\\n'''Option 2'''\\n\\nIf you want to hitchhike along the coast, you can try to start at State Route 60. Take a train to Clarkson (the most northern stop of the Joondalup line) and change for bus 484 going to Alkimos and hop off at Ridgewood Bvd After Hester Av (7 stops, I believe). Walk back 200 m to the main road passing by a petrol station on your left, turn left and follow the main road for 1.5 km until you reach State Route 60. Turn right and after 100 m there should two fairly busy petrol stations. I (single male) didn't have any problems to get a lift to the pinnacles or Jurien Bay.

In winter it does get cold at hitchhiking at night in the desert. (Even though you've never seen it be cold in Australia on the TV, it does happen. Don't tell anyone.) If you're heading for the east coast the quickest and comfiest option is with a truck if you can get one who isn't prohibited from giving lifts, one who maybe owns his own truck.  You can have good luck with this just by thumbing on the roadside, as well as talking to the driver at a servo (service station) or truck/rest stop (these can be quiet though).  Most trucks are carrying things to be delivered by Monday morning at their destination, so the busiest times for them leaving Perth are Wednesday, Thursday and Friday whereas you will see much fewer on a Saturday or Sunday.  Trucks will not go through Kalgoorlie, they cut across from Coolgardie to Norseman.\\n\\nIf you hitch a car they may ask if you're willing to share the driving, in which case be aware that driving on the left and through thousands of kilometers of empty road in the desert leads easily to that special kind of microsleep where one may crash in a second, so take it easy! \\n\\nGetting out of Perth, take the train to Midland station, at the end of the line. From here take bus 320 and ask the driver to put you down on Great Eastern Hwy Before Park Rd A. There is a small paved rest stop area before the bus stop, where cars and even trucks can pull over easily, and good visibility of the road for some distance. Here you're out of the city already and should easily get a lift at least a few km along the road to the towns of Sawyer's Valley and Baker's Hill, which are good places to catch a longer ride as the road slows there for the townships.  Further along is Northam, which the main highway bypasses (don't take a lift into the town, but rather stay on the bypass which is the highway).  There is an ok spot to stand at the second turnoff to Northam, but it is just by the highway and people tend to be driving by fast. A lot of the traffic to (Kal)goorlie is worker dudes returning to work after a splash in the big smoke, easy rides, most traffic going long distance will be <12am.\\n\\nThe bus only goes once an hour from Midland, mostly at the half-hour but you may want to check in advance to avoid a long wait. You'll be getting off in Zone 3, so plan your bus/train ticket accordingly. Midland train station is also a famously bad area of Perth, so take care of your stuff and yourself, and don't be there at night if you can help it. But you'll be fine in the daytime and there are usually police around somewhere. Just be aware also that if you look too scruffy, drivers may hesitiate to pick you up on account of this.\\n\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|Australia}}\\n[[Category:Australia]]\\n[[Category:E15]]\",\n",

The people in WA are generally more relaxed, friendly and trusting than folks on the east coast, which makes it a great place to hitchhike. Whether it's a short trip around the South-West forests and beaches, a full blown stint across the Nullarbor to Adelaide or an escape north to Broome or Darwin for the winter, it is usually less than half an hour's wait until your first ride out of Perth. As with any city, the trick is to get as far out of town as you can using the local public transport (Perth has a train network that will take you to within cooee of all the good hitching spots). Once you're at the spot, it's usually just a hop, skip and a jump or the straight and narrow to your next destination.

The risk of [[traffic jam hitchhiking|traffic jams]] on this part of the near [[highway|motorway]] 8 (''Autobahn 8'', A 8) is among the highest of whole Germany. To relax this situation there is road constructions taking place and adding to the problem at the moment.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\nFor longer distances it is advisable to take the motorway. The motorway 8 bends around the north and east of the city to [[Stuttgart]] (east) and [[Karlsruhe]] (west).\\n\\n=== Eastwards ([[Stuttgart]], [[Munich|München]]) {{Autobahn|8}} ===\\nTo travel eastwards use the [[on-ramp]] ''Pforzheim Ost'' or ''Pforzheim Süd'' or go to the [[rest area|service area]] Pforzheim that is located near the on-ramp ''Pforzheim Ost'' or rather the crossroads with [[national road]] 10 (''B 10'') before Niefern. Those places are some kilometres away from the town centre and it may be worth to hitchhike (the B 10) or take a bus. Buses of route 1 of the city bus service in direction Eutingen go that direction.\\n\\n=== Westwards ([[Karlsruhe]], [[France]], [[Luxembourg|Luxemburg]], [[Belgium]]) {{Autobahn|8}} ===\\nFor westbound travels use the motorway entrance ''Pforzheim West''. It is located on the Wilferdinger Höhe, a big industrial area in the northwest of the city. Busses of route 6 in direction “Lange Grund” go up there. The national road 10 (“B 10”, that also goes to Karlsruhe in the end) runs all the way through the length of the Wilferdinger Höhe; shortly after the towns end in the west to the right there is the on-ramp. Shortly before there is a [[fuel station]] (“Jet”) and a fast food restaurant (“Burger King”). There you can stand next to the street with a [[signs|sign]] or with your [[thumb]] out or [[ask]] drivers at the fuel station or restaurant. Normally it's no problem to get a ride to Karlsruhe; a big part of the traffic to Karlsruhe takes that route.\\n\\n=== Southwards ===\\nTo the south the motorway network runs on both sides around the Black Forest. Depending on whether your destination is east or west of the Black Forest you either start to the east or the west from Pforzheim: In the west near Karlsruhe the motorway 5 goes off to the south, being a good option for Freiburg, Basel, Switzerland and France; in the east the A 81 goes south towards the Bodensee. Therefore the recommended [[place]]s to try are the same as either those for going east or west.\\n\\n=== Northwards ===\\nTo go up north it is advisable to go over the A 5 that passes Karlsruhe and later joins the A 7, because normally it has more traffic than the A 7 and is easier to reach.\\nYou can also accept all the offers here that only take you to Karlsruhe; as long as you don't miss the right exit you are as good off on the northwards hitching place in Karlsruhe, that is going to be at least as good as here.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n__NOTOC__\\n\\n[[Category:Baden-Württemberg]]\\n[[Category:Germany]]\\n\\n[[de:Pforzheim]]\",\n",

(You can always walk across the bridge, but there are no good places to get a ride from the other side.)  Probably the best technique is to get to a gas station along routes 70 or 38.

Conductors come around after each stop checking for new fares, so unless you buy a ticket you'll be asked to get off at the next stop if you don't pay up on-board.

Traffic will be slow after coming around the bend, so don't stand too far down the ramp.  \\n==== Oregon Ave. on-ramp ([http://hitchwiki.org/maps/?place=22318 HW Map]) ====\\nThis spot has more trucks, but in the states, they seldom stop on on-ramps.\\n\\n=== North on [[I-95]] towards [[Trenton, NJ|Trenton]], [[New Jersey|NJ]]; [[New York City|New York]], [[New York State|NY]]; [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts|MA]]; [[Maine]]===\\n==== Oregon Ave. on-ramp ([http://hitchwiki.org/maps/?place=22432 HW Map]) ====\\nThis spot has lots of truck traffic, but they seldom stop on on-ramps.\\n\\n=== West on [[I-76]] towards [[Valley Forge, PA|Valley Forge]], [[Ohio]] ===\\n==== From Exit 338 ([http://hitchwiki.org/maps/?place=22437 HW Map]) ====\\nTake the Manayunk/Norristown regional rail line (or a bus) to Manayunk station.  Follow the tracks northwest to Green Ln.  Turn left and follow it to cross the bridge across the Schuylkill (SKOO-kull) River.   After crossing an onramp to I-76W will be on the right.  \\n\\n=== East to [[New Jersey]] ===\\n==== Walt Whitman Bridge ====\\nThe Walt Whitman is the best bridge to Jersey, since it connects directly to [[I-295]] and the A/C expressway.  There's only a toll in the westbound direction, so you'll have to use an on-ramp.  There is a good place to hitch under the bridge at Front St. ([http://hitchwiki.org/maps/?place=26792 HW Map]).  Check the green signs to make sure you're in the right place.  \\n\\n==== Ben Franklin Bridge ====\\nIf you insist on taking the Ben Franklin bridge, take PATCO across the bridge and into the state.  (You can always walk across the bridge, but there are no good places to get a ride from the other side.)  Probably the best technique is to get to a gas station along routes 70 or 38.  Gas is significantly cheaper in New Jersey so people often fuel up after entering the state.  The indians who run the stations are probably friendly, and you won't attract as much police attention by staying off the road (hitchhiking is explicitly illegal in Jersey).  \\n\\n== Accommodation and sleep ==\\nFairmount park is big enough to camp in.\\n\\n== Public transport ==\\nThe Philadelphia-area public transportation network is called SEPTA ([http://www.septa.org website]). It encompasses local buses, subways, trolleys, and trains.  You can get transit directions from their website or [http://maps.google.com Google Maps].  \\n\\n=== Buses, trolleys, subways ===\\nThe buses and trolleys are nearly impossible to blackride on and, for the most part, remain within in the city anyway.\\nThe subway is good and cheap if you need to get around the city, but are also difficult to blackride on.\\n\\n=== Regional Rail ===\\nHowever, the trains are fairly easy to blackride on. You can get out of the city in most any direction via SEPTA's regional rail train. Most of these trains don't check tickets until after you're on; if tickets are checked pre-boarding, just wait for the next train. Conductors come around after each stop checking for new fares, so unless you buy a ticket you'll be asked to get off at the next stop if you don't pay up on-board. However, many passengers leave their tickets on-board, so finding one before the conductor comes through is possible.\\n\\n== Places to visit ==\\nPhiladelphia is rich in independence '''history''' if you like that sort of thing.  Check out the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall.  \\n\\nThere is a great '''music''' scene too.  [http://diyphl.com DIYPHL.com] has good show listings.  \\n\\nThere's a '''bonfire''' that happens Wednesdays at the Glendinning Rock Garden, just north of Girard and 33rd.

It is not a hitchhiker-friendly city by far, one big suburban sprawl full of highways, but there are some good spots around to get out of it.\\n\\nThe city is in the middle of a large, desert valley and surrounded by many suburban cities. When someone mentions Phoenix they are sometimes referring to the entire valley, which includes the cities of Tempe, Mesa, Chandler, Scottsdale, Glendale, Peoria, and others. Temperatures rarely get below freezing in the winter, but watch out in summer! Afternoons in late June and July can be as high as 120 degrees Fahrenheit, but usually in the 110s. This can be especially difficult for budget travelers, since there are alarmingly few public drinking fountains available. However, common practice for any business establishment (or resident) is to provide free drinking water when asked.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Tempe\\'\\'\\' is a popular hangout in the winter for street kids and other travelers, due to the university nearby and several places to stealth camp, such as Papago Park, a large urban park with hills and caves. Mill Avenue is the main drag, and while it has become much more yuppified over the years, you will still see a few traveling folks along the street and in the coffee shops.\\n\\nHitchhiking out of the Phoenix area means getting to an outlying suburb by bus ($2 one way bus fare) or have a friend drop you at a good spot, then planting yourself at a major truck stop exit or nearby highway on-ramp.  Note that public transport is quite slow and quirky, which is to say, it rarely goes where needed or expected and is almost guaranteed to be at least 20 minutes late. Also note that there are no transfers available, though a day pass can be purchased for $4 on the bus.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n__TOC__\\n=== West towards [[California]] {{US-I|10}} ===\\n====Love\\'s Travel Stop in Buckeye==== \\nFirst you need to get to Desert Sky Transit Center. There are no direct buses from downtown Phoenix but you can take for example [http://routes.valleymetro.org/timetables/transit_route/765?type=2 bus 3 Westbound] from Van Burren & Central Avenue and get off on Van Burren & 75th. Desert Sky is 2.5 miles to the north. From there [http://routes.valleymetro.org/timetables/801/transit_route?type=7 bus 685] to Gila Bend/Ajo passes near Love\\'s Truck Stop. It costs $4. If you take it seven stops from Desert Sky, you can hitchhike at the truck stop and there are many fast food places that may be good for soliciting rides. Bear in mind that there are only a few buses a day Monday to Friday (5.15 am, 9.55 am, 12.40 pm, 3.55 pm and 7 pm) and two on Saturday (11 am and 3 pm). [[User:wallpaper|Wallpaper]] was harassed by police here and told to leave after waiting for only five minutes.\\nShe now finds it worthwhile to take the 685 bus all the way to Gila Bend when hitchhiking into Southern California.\\n\\n====Exit 137 at 67th Avenue==== \\nFrom downtown Phoenix, take local bus 17 west, get off at 67th avenue and walk 1/2 mile south. Two truckstops here: Flying J and Danny\\'s-A Big Rig Resort. Between the two is a public road that all trucks must pass to get back onto the highway. Stand here at the corner with a sign stating your destination (\"I-10 WEST\", for example). [[User:thewindandrain|TheWindAndRain]] waited at this spot for 3 days before giving up and deciding to go a different direction. \\n\\n=== South and East towards [[Tucson]] and [[New Mexico]] {{US-I|10}} === \\n====Love\\'s Travel Stop in Chandler====\\nFrom Phoenix take any bus or light rail going to Tempe Transportation Center. You\\'ll be better off taking a bus as you can pay for one ride which is $2 and ask for a transfer slip and take another bus from Tempe without additional cost. There are no free transfers from light rail. Once in Tempe take [http://routes.valleymetro.org/timetables/transit_route/799?type=2 bus 66 to Lone Butte Casino] which is the last stop. Walk towards Chevron gas station and turn right/west into Allison Road. Continue for a mile until you get to traffic lights and turn left/south. You will see large McDonald\\'s sign. Once there at Exit 162, Love\\'s Travel Stop is a new truck stop nearby and the highway on-ramp is large enough for a truck to stop. [[User:Salman|This hitchhiker]] has received several rides from here, from cars heading to the area of Casa Grande. Just past Casa Grande is the I-8/ I-10 junction, with several large truck stops. You should not accept any ride going a shorter distance than this. If you hold out, you may make it all the way to Tucson in one ride.\\n\\nIf you prefer to hitchhike from the highway, take the lightrail to the Country Club/Main station. Then take the 112 bus all the way south, to the Chandler Park and Ride. From there, you can walk along hwy 87/Country Club Rd for aprox 5 miles, until it splits off and goes through the Akimel O\\'odaam reservation. This is a great route to follow to Tucson if you\\'d prefer to avoid the interstate. Just try not to end up in Florence- there\\'s a prison there, so it\\'s harder to hitchhike.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Sedona]] and [[Flagstaff]] {{US-I|17}} ===\\n====Carefree Highway junction or Deer Valley Road====\\nIt is unsafe to hitchhike an {{US-I|17}} on-ramp until at least as far north as Bell Rd or Deer Valley Rd. Ideally, you want to be outside the city at Carefree Highway before starting to hitchhike, but unless you can hustle a local ride this far, try this: \\n\\nFrom downtown Phoenix take bus #27 north to the Metrocenter Transit Center. Get a free transfer ticket when you board. Take #35 north bus to the end of the line (tell the bus driver to let you off closest to the furthest I-17 on-ramp, Deer Valley Road). This on-ramp is not ideal, but there is room for a car to safely pull to the shoulder. If you find yourself waiting long, make a sign that says \"Carefree Highway\". It is only about 10 miles further north, and many drivers getting on the highway are going at least that far. If dropped off at Carefree, stick out your thumb and smile. You should have a long ride soon. No need to accept any ride less than to Cordes Junction (about 50 miles). Avoid taking a ride to New River (suspicious locals due to upscale housing, possible cop hassle as a result). Black Canyon City may be an interesting stop with some good cafes in town (Rock Springs Cafe, Four Bees Cafe), but you may have a hard time getting out.\\n\\n=== Northeast towards [[Payson]] {{StateHighway|Arizona|87}} === \\nIf you want to try your luck northeast along the Beeline Highway to Payson and Eastern Arizona, you will need to get out to Fountain Hills past the city of Scottsdale. Local bus service using bus #106 north will only take you part of the way, to Shea Road at 134th street. You will need to go another 10 miles or so past upscale residential areas before beginning to hitchhike without major hassle. There are many drivers en route heading for Fort Mcdowell casino and if you can catch a ride that far you can begin hitchhiking soon after. Try walking along the sidewalk with your back to traffic and your thumb out until you get far enough to really lay on the hitchhiking persuasion. \\n\\nAnother possibly easier location to hitch from is the intersection of {{StateHighway|Arizona|87}} and McDowell on the north edge of Mesa, just north of {{StateHighway|Arizona|202}}.\\n\\n[[User:wallpaper|Wallpaper]] has hitchhiked to [[Payson]] (and beyond!) from the [https://goo.gl/maps/pxGSvXBaLqCxuQnXA AZ 87 and Gilbert Rd], just east of the Salt River landfill. She has used this route several times successfully with short waits and no police hassle. To get there take the lightrail as far east as it goes- get off at Gilbert/Main. Then take the Gilbert bus north as far as it goes, to McDowell Rd. (Total cost: $4) Walk 2.5 miles north until Gilbert Rd. ends at the Beeline Hwy (AZ 87). From here, there is large shoulder and all traffic is at least going to Fountain Hills or the Casino, but much of the traffic is going all the way to Payson. I have started trips to Payson, Flagstaff, Canyon de Chelly, ABQ, Moab, and Salt Lake City all from this spot.\\n\\n=== Northwest towards [[Wickenburg]] and [[Las Vegas]] {{US-R|60}} and {{US-R|93}} ===\\nThere\\'s a good spot around 163rd Ave.  [[User:Guaka|guaka]] and Kenny only waited a short time before being picked up. [[User:thewindandrain|TheWindAndRain]] can attest to the fact that the Flying J at 163rd and I10 is an easy place to catch a truck ride to [[Wickenburg]].\\n\\n== Legal issues ==\\nHitchhiking is at the very least discouraged within the Phoenix metro area and may be outright illegal. For this reason, always get to the far city limits, as mentioned in the exit points above, before attempting to hitchhiking. Otherwise, expect cop hassle and possibly a warning citation or fine. \\n\\n== Personal experiences ==\\n\\'\\'There is absolutely no reason a hitchhiker should purposely visit the greater Phoenix area, unless you are a wealthy sociopathic masochist with a golf fetish, in which case you likely have a massive SUV, as most people in the Phoenix area are/have. Not only is it an overheated and ugly sprawl of freeways, beige two-car garages, golf courses, more freeways, and Walmarts, the people of Phoenix are generally quite rude to anyone they perceive as either not having very much money, or having a skin color any shade darker than the sand which envelops the area, and meeting both of these criteria will likely get you arrested and imprisoned for several years. People in the greater Phoenix area also tend to judge others based on the size, cleanliness, newness, and luxuriousness of their cars, which leads to a booming car sales industry, a constant haze of smog over the clogged freeways, and a nearly frightening number of lanes on major roads, but also means that someone without a car (ie a hitchhiker) will be assumed to be either insane or subhuman, and will be treated as such. In general, avoid Phoenix and its environs at all cost.\\'\\' - Josiahsettles\\n\\n\\'\\'Within the unimaginably vast urban sprawl of Phoenix, there are a few hidden gems. Palabras Bilingual Bookstore is a community hub and mainstay. South Mountain regional park (accessible via public transit, bring lots of water)--connecting with the Sonoran desert and this sacred mountain range is worth your time. Around downtown Phoenix, also check out: Burton Barr Library (5 story building with views of the city, free internet access, an Arizona room), an all ages music venue called \"The Trunk Space,\" the Grand Ave arts district. The town of Guadalupe (near Tempe) has a wonderful local market and many colorful murals on display. Tempe now has a monthly Really Really Free Market going, along with a wonderful community bicycle shop called Bike Saviours.

It is part of the central group of the Azores. Pico island is named after Mount Pico, the volcano that dominates the landscape of this island. Pico means \\'\\'peak\\'\\' in Portuguese. It is the highest mountain of the Azores and [[Portugal]]. The island is divided into three municipalities: [[Lajes do Pico]], [[São Roque do Pico]], and [[Madalena]].\\n\\n== Hitchhiking ==\\nHitchhiking is fairly easy on the coastal main roads that connect almost all of the settlements on Pico island. As there is only a very irregular bus service, many people will understand why you are trying to hitchhike and pick you up. As always, you might also find some who will try to make you take a taxi. Hitchhiking to Mount Pico is comparably difficult. The main roads going there don\\'t connect the bigger settlements, hence only a few farmers and tourists pass by. Hitchhiking down might prove easier, especially in the evening.\\n\\n== How to get there ==\\nIf not [[hitchhiking a sailboat|hitchhiking sailing boats]], then ferries are your only choice. It is not possible to travel for free, as tickets are charged per person. Coming from Horta on [[Faial]] you can take a Transmaçor ferry to Madalena, while ferries to the other islands (e.g. atlânticoline) leave at São Roque. If you missed your ferry and have to get somewhere urgently, there is also an airport with flights connecting Pico to other islands of the Azores and to mainland Portugal. In summer, ferries are sometimes completely booked out, so buy your ticket ahead at RIAC offices. See [[Azores#Useful information|useful information]] for tips on saving money.\\n\\n== Useful information ==\\nAs Pico island is not densely populated, finding spots for camping is not too difficult, especially in the interior of the island. You can also have free showers at some \"public swimming pools\" in the Atlantic Ocean. Go to the tourist information in São Roque for free internet access. If you want to climb Mount Pico, be prepared to pay 10€ per person at the entrance or 2,50€ when going with a guide. A guide is not necessary to find your way, but when going with several people, it might turn out to be cheaper taking one with you. Going up and down takes about 6-8 hours. It is also possible to stay for the night in the crater and to enjoy sunrise on top of Mount Pico. You should also take in mind that climbing Mount Pico is not always possible due to unstable weather conditions and strong winds.\\n\\n{{Azores Islands}}\\n{{IsIn|Azores}}\\n[[Category:Portugal]]',\n",

It is worth noting that they said it was ilegal to hitch down this ramp even though we were off the highway.\\n\\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\\n\\n[[nomad:Pilsen]] [[trash:Pilsen]]\\n\\n\\n{{Cities Czech Republic}}\\n{{Highways CZ}}',\n",

One spot in Gaia is a roundabout, next to the last metro stop (\\'\\'Santo Ovídio\\'\\'). This is an okay spot to stand, even at night, for going to both towards the north Porto and above as well as going south (but it is definitely easier to get a ride to the north there). It is better if you stare down the highway which points towards A1 Highway going to Lisbon and turning right to Porto and North, there is a small red light and stand there if you want to head back to Porto and North.\\n\\n==== From Repsol, Vila Nova de Gaia ====\\n\\n[[File:Porto_south_repsol_back_entrance.jpeg|200px|thumb|right|The entrance to the fenced tunnel to the back entrance of the gas station]]   There is a petrol station on the A1 highway just after the ramp which is excellent for rides to the south. Get to the last stop of the metro line D called Santo Ovídio. Walk south down Rua de Soares dos Reis (N1) and continue walking when it becomes the Rue Fonte dos Arrependidos. Pass under the highway through the tunnel and keep walking on the Rua Alto das Terras. After a few hundred meters you will see the petrol station on your left. Should take ~15 minutes, mostly downhill and in the shade. Walk the dirt road full of garbage to the left till you find fenced tunnel (pictured) that leads to door to the station with a doorbell you can ring so the staff will come and let you in. They\\'re fine with coming to open it.\\nAs of May 2019 the doorbell is broken, but if you happen to have a mobile phone with you, you can call them at +351 22 712 6842 and they will open the door for you (it\\'s really work!). In case you don\\'t have a working sim card, you can probably shout to attract attention and have them come over. Failing that, it\\'s also easy to get to the petrol station for someone that is ok with a \"short moment of illegality\": after the tunnel you can climb to your left side and then walk along the highway for some meters to the petrol station. Otherwise it\\'s also possible to climb over the gas station fence. A special tip, after the tunnel keep looking on your left side, you can find a lot of wild strawberries (in Summer, of course).\\n\\nYou can either stand in the petrol station or at the exit ramp. You can also try to stand in the highway itself, but as a passing policeman said, it is unlikely cars in the highway stop.\\n\\nThe following service station on the A1 is called Antuã-Estarreja. Anyone who is going in the direction of [[Aveiro]] but not to Lisbon can drop you off here, where there will be plenty off cars almost all bound straight for Lisbon.\\n\\n=== The route to [[France]] ===\\n\\nFor people trying to go from Porto and enter France as fast as possible. Go to the second Gas station, get lift in the direction of Viseu and then get dropped at any petrol station and then look out for cars and Portugese trucks which are going to France or cars that are from Belgium or Netherlands. Be patient and ensure you do not get down anywhere else but only \\'\\'\\'petrol stations\\'\\'\\'; don\\'t go with drivers to their city center or you will get stuck. Near border of Spain before the border if you are at a gas station, wait until you find a car or truck that goes all the way to Saint Sebastian, a Spanish town on the French border. You will have to be patient and you will definitely find with a little time and patience. Try to get a direct ride to France ( so that you can \\'\\'\\'skip Spain\\'\\'\\') which is a disaster for long distance hitchhiking.\\n\\nStart from the petrol station near \"Vila nova de Gaia\".\\n\\n=== North towards [[Braga]] and [[Spain]] ([[Vigo]], [[Santiago de Compostela]]) ===\\n\\n==== Option 1 ====\\n\\nTake the Tram/Train to São Frutuoso\\u200e (less than 2 Euro). Walk the \\'\\'Rua Prof. Antonio Marques\\'\\' until the end and you\\'ll arrive at a petrol station right next to the motorway to Vigo/Spain after appx 800m.\\n\\'\\'Note:\\'\\' There is a fence around the whole petrol station, almost impossible to climb. To ring the bell and ask for entrance is a bad idea. Walk along the fence until the bridge where it\\'s easy to climb over (January 2012). Try to be unwatched climbing the fence, the petrol station is privatized. I got kicked out in January 2012...In February 2012 I got dropped off on the other side direction Lisbon and had no problem at all staying at the petrol station. Just make sure they don\\'t see you enter the petrol station \"illegally\".--[[User:Wukk|Wukk]] 18:14, 28 February 2012 (CET)\\n\\n==== Option 2 ====\\n\\nYou may hitch from the petrol station close to metro station \"Estadio do mar\". At the roundabout, take Av. Calouste Gulbenkian, pass the School of design and you will see an entrance to coastal motorway A28 going North. People might also be going North using other motorways from there since there is a junction heading East close by.\\n\\nThere are probably many other ways of leaving Porto in that direction, yet to be discovered and shared.\\n\\nMe and my travel-buddy tried the petrol station close to the metro station \"Estadio do mar\", but couldn\\'t get a ride after trying for one hour. Some people at the petrol station told us about a FREE shuttle bus \\'\\'\\'(free bus shuttle – MAR Lines – ended its operation in July 31st 2017\\'\\'\\' ) going north to IKEA (located close to the motorway A28) where a lot of spanish people go for shopping. The best way to get to the bus-station for the free shuttle-bus is to take the metro to \"Senhora da Hora\" (one stop before \"Estadio do mar\"), walk back (if you took the metro from the city) on the street along the metro-line, take a right into the street called \"Avenida de António Domingues dos Santos / Rua da Barranha\" and find a bus-station on the right side. This is how it looks like:\\n\\nhttp://maps.google.com/maps?q=senhora+da+hora,+4460+Matosinhos,+Oporto,+Portugal&hl=en&ll=41.186549,-8.654994&spn=0.000793,0.001161&sll=41.253032,-8.602295&sspn=1.497015,2.37854&vpsrc=0&t=h&layer=c&cbll=41.186549,-8.654994&panoid=gGtOnq9c4EOLBmuF6RQZqQ&cbp=12,299.34,,0,6.98&z=20\\n\\nTake the red bus to \"Mar Shopping\" and get off there. We were standing at the exit of the parking-lot of IKEA and got a ride to \"Viana do Castelo\" after 15 minutes. This is how the mall and the bus look like:\\n\\nhttp://maps.google.com/maps?q=ikea+mar+shopping,+4460+Matosinhos,+Oporto,+Portugal&hl=en&ll=41.208864,-8.689574&spn=0.006094,0.009291&sll=41.209914,-8.657227&sspn=0.093627,0.148659&vpsrc=6&z=17&layer=c&cbll=41.20876,-8.689572&panoid=xx4h3tQhwqqamcgEh1_2aQ&cbp=12,22.54,,0,11.78\\n\\nThe free shuttle-bus runs every 1,5 hours. The IKEA is open Monday to Saturday 10h-23h and Sunday/Holidays 10h-20h. I assume those times the shuttle bus runs aswell. Should it not run you can walk down \"Avenida de António Domingues dos Santos / Rua da Barranha\" from the bus-station to the metro station \"Estadio do mar\" in a few minutes and follow the descriptions above.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Amarante]], [[Vila Real]], [[Mirandela]] and [[Bragança]] ===\\n\\nThe [http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/A4_%28autoestrada%29#.C3.81reas_de_servi.C3.A7o_e_de_repouso second petrol station] on the A4 motorway is a good spot to catch a ride East. You can get there\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'By Metro (1,50€ from center)\\'\\'\\' <br>\\nTake the metro line F (direction FANZERES) and get out at CAMPAÍNHA (not to be confused with Campanhã!). From there you can walk:\\n\\nhttps://www.google.com/maps/dir/Campa%C3%ADnha,+4435-140+Rio+Tinto/41.2000340,+-8.5645780/@41.1938539,-8.5616676,1165m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m15!4m14!1m5!1m1!1s0xd2463eb34b18f31:0x9959d0cff0f293ca!2m2!1d-8.553955!2d41.183452!1m5!1m1!1s0x0:0x0!2m2!1d-8.564578!2d41.200034!3e2!5i1?hl=de\\n\\nThe walk takes about 30min (fast walking) and to enter the petrol station you can easily jump the fence if you follow it from the gate to the left.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'By Train (1,40€ from center)\\'\\'\\' <br>\\nFor a shorter walk, take a train going to Braga, Guimarães, or Marco/Caíde (green, red, or blue line) from \"S. Bento\" or \"Campanhã\",  and get off at \"Águas Santas/Palmilheira\".\\n\\nhttps://www.google.com/maps/dir/41.200041,-8.5565396/41.2000340,+-8.5645780/@41.1980698,-8.5662228,15z/data=!4m9!4m8!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x0:0x0!2m2!1d-8.564578!2d41.200034!3e2\\n\\nATTENTION: There are only 3 other petrol stations on this motorway ([http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/A4_%28autoestrada%29#.C3.81reas_de_servi.C3.A7o_e_de_repouso check Wikipedia for update]), one just after [[Penafiel]], the next one near Lamares after Villa Real, and the last just before [[Mirandela]], so if you stay on the petrol station above, ask drivers going to [[Vila Real]] to leave you on Penafiel\\'s petrol Station, from there it\\'s pretty easy to get a hitch to [[Amarante]] and [[Vila Real]].\\n\\n=== Sleep ===\\nIf you walk from the centre east, just past the second to last white bridge there is an old train line between the upper centre and the lower road that runs along the river. Along this old train line are a few old train tunnels that are easy and relatively clean. Easily accessible from the lower road and from the top by stairways. \\n\\nIf you continue East a little more, nearing the last white bridge and opposite the beach there are a few empty fields, again between the lower road and the town above. Locals pass through these fields, but it would be easy to spend the night without being bothered. \\n\\nAnother good option is to pitch a tent or just sleep in the bushes in the biggest park of Porto - Parque de Cidade. It\\'s located quite far from the center, but in a very nice area near the ocean. Park is huge and there are a lot of good places with bushes and trees for a tent. In the center of this park there is a large public WC which has free hot showers. It is a large round concrete building with ivy growing all around it, you can\\'t miss it! Only open during the day. There is good transport connection with the city center, or just follow Avenida da Boavista, it takes 60-80 minutes on foot from the center..\\n\\nPorto center streets can be a bit scary at night, if you need to sleep well and safe the airport is your best option. It is warm and safe and you can blackride the metro from the center to there in about 30 minutes and return the next morning to the city.\\n\\nCamping\\nThere is a lot of campings near \"Praia de Madalena\". It is close to the city centre, you just have to take the bus number 906. A place costs 6 euro per night.\\n\\n=== Eat ===\\nOn the Rua Doutor Alves da Veiga/Rua de Fernandes Tomas every weekday charity organisations feed people, start at 21:00. Ofcourse for free.\\n\\nFood is very cheap in Portugal, you can have a dinner for 3.5 euro.\\n\\nDuring Livediverse\\'s stay in Porto, he got this recommendations for cheap vegan food:\\n\\nRes da Rua\\n\\nCasa da Horta\\n\\nEspaço Compasso\\n\\nYou can also eat in some another places which serve organic food like Quintal Bioshop. There is also a place called Suribachi which serves macrobiotic food.\\n\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|Portugal}}\\n\\n[[Category:Portugal]]\\n[[Category:E1]]\\n\\n[[de:Porto]]',\n",

This is how the mall and the bus look like:\\n\\nhttp://maps.google.com/maps?q=ikea+mar+shopping,+4460+Matosinhos,+Oporto,+Portugal&hl=en&ll=41.208864,-8.689574&spn=0.006094,0.009291&sll=41.209914,-8.657227&sspn=0.093627,0.148659&vpsrc=6&z=17&layer=c&cbll=41.20876,-8.689572&panoid=xx4h3tQhwqqamcgEh1_2aQ&cbp=12,22.54,,0,11.78\\n\\nThe free shuttle-bus runs every 1,5 hours. The IKEA is open Monday to Saturday 10h-23h and Sunday/Holidays 10h-20h. I assume those times the shuttle bus runs aswell. Should it not run you can walk down \"Avenida de António Domingues dos Santos / Rua da Barranha\" from the bus-station to the metro station \"Estadio do mar\" in a few minutes and follow the descriptions above.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Amarante]], [[Vila Real]], [[Mirandela]] and [[Bragança]] ===\\n\\nThe [http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/A4_%28autoestrada%29#.C3.81reas_de_servi.C3.A7o_e_de_repouso second petrol station] on the A4 motorway is a good spot to catch a ride East. You can get there\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'By Metro (1,50€ from center)\\'\\'\\' <br>\\nTake the metro line F (direction FANZERES) and get out at CAMPAÍNHA (not to be confused with Campanhã!). From there you can walk:\\n\\n{{Coords|41.1938539|-8.5616676}}\\n\\nThe walk takes about 30min (fast walking) and to enter the petrol station you can easily jump the fence if you follow it from the gate to the left.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'By Train (1,40€ from center)\\'\\'\\' <br>\\nFor a shorter walk, take a train going to Braga, Guimarães, or Marco/Caíde (green, red, or blue line) from \"S. Bento\" or \"Campanhã\",  and get off at \"Águas Santas/Palmilheira\".\\n\\nhttps://www.google.com/maps/dir/41.200041,-8.5565396/41.2000340,+-8.5645780/@41.1980698,-8.5662228,15z/data=!4m9!4m8!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x0:0x0!2m2!1d-8.564578!2d41.200034!3e2\\n\\nATTENTION: There are only 3 other petrol stations on this motorway ([http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/A4_%28autoestrada%29#.C3.81reas_de_servi.C3.A7o_e_de_repouso check Wikipedia for update]), one just after [[Penafiel]], the next one near Lamares after Villa Real, and the last just before [[Mirandela]], so if you stay on the petrol station above, ask drivers going to [[Vila Real]] to leave you on Penafiel\\'s petrol Station, from there it\\'s pretty easy to get a hitch to [[Amarante]] and [[Vila Real]].\\n\\n=== Sleep ===\\nIf you walk from the centre east, just past the second to last white bridge there is an old train line between the upper centre and the lower road that runs along the river. Along this old train line are a few old train tunnels that are easy and relatively clean. Easily accessible from the lower road and from the top by stairways. \\n\\nIf you continue East a little more, nearing the last white bridge and opposite the beach there are a few empty fields, again between the lower road and the town above. Locals pass through these fields, but it would be easy to spend the night without being bothered. \\n\\nAnother good option is to pitch a tent or just sleep in the bushes in the biggest park of Porto - Parque de Cidade. It\\'s located quite far from the center, but in a very nice area near the ocean. Park is huge and there are a lot of good places with bushes and trees for a tent. In the center of this park there is a large public WC which has free hot showers. It is a large round concrete building with ivy growing all around it, you can\\'t miss it! Only open during the day. There is good transport connection with the city center, or just follow Avenida da Boavista, it takes 60-80 minutes on foot from the center..\\n\\nPorto center streets can be a bit scary at night, if you need to sleep well and safe the airport is your best option. It is warm and safe and you can blackride the metro from the center to there in about 30 minutes and return the next morning to the city.\\n\\nCamping\\nThere is a lot of campings near \"Praia de Madalena\". It is close to the city centre, you just have to take the bus number 906. A place costs 6 euro per night.\\n\\n=== Eat ===\\nOn the Rua Doutor Alves da Veiga/Rua de Fernandes Tomas every weekday charity organisations feed people, start at 21:00. Ofcourse for free.\\n\\nFood is very cheap in Portugal, you can have a dinner for 3.5 euro.\\n\\nDuring Livediverse\\'s stay in Porto, he got this recommendations for cheap vegan food:\\n\\nRes da Rua\\n\\nCasa da Horta\\n\\nEspaço Compasso\\n\\nYou can also eat in some another places which serve organic food like Quintal Bioshop. There is also a place called Suribachi which serves macrobiotic food.\\n\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|Portugal}}\\n\\n[[Category:Portugal]]\\n[[Category:E1]]\\n\\n[[de:Porto]]'},\n",

The city is wholly located on Portsea Island in the Solent, which is connected to mainland England by three road bridges and a railway bridge. The city is famous for its naval base (with HMS Victory and Mary Rose open for visitors) and Gunwharf Quays Shopping Centre.\\n\\nThe city is not of the nicest in Britain, and hitch-hiking out of it seems to be difficult − perhaps because of a lot of antisocial behaviour in the city.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n=== North/West/East out of city ===\\nTheoretically, there is a good place to stand right at the start of ''M275'' motorway, by the continental fery port where A3 splits - there is a wide place to stop (about the entire lane of hatched markings), a lot of traffic and a speed limit of 50mph.\\n\\nHowever, due to a lot of antisocial behaviour in the city and complete paranoia of the city's citizens, the waits may be long. It may be better to ask someone personally at a petrol station nearby. If the driver is going towards [[Brighton]], and you are going towards [[Southampton]], and them to drop you off at Farlington Services, off the Portsmouth (E) exit (A2030), where {{Mgb|27}} becomes A27. It is far easier to hitch-hike from outside Portsmouth.\\n\\n=== South by ferry to Fishbourne, [[Isle of Wight]] ===\\nThe easiest way to hitch to the Isle of Wight is on a car ferry run by Wightlink [http://wightlink.co.uk/].  As with most ferries, the cars are queued up in a lot before they are directed on to the ferry.  The lot is easy to get to by foot, and although it is overrun with mean-looking workers in day-glo vests, nobody stopped [[user:Dr.Keith|Keith]] in Sept. 2011.  People pay for the car and the price is the same for any number of passengers, so it shouldn't be tough to find a ride.  You may even want to turn some rides down until you find one going to your destination.\\n\\n=== By ferry to [[France]] ([[St. Malo]], [[Le Havre]], [[Cherbourg]]), [[Channel Islands]] and [[Spain]] ([[Bilbao]]) ===\\nAccording to the port's website [http://www.portsmouth-port.co.uk/ferry_passengers/offers], there are three ferries operating to France, the Channel Islands, and Spain.  They are Condor [http://www.condorferries.co.uk/home.html], LD [http://www.ldlines.co.uk/], and Britany [http://www.brittany-ferries.co.uk/offers].  All of them appear to have different prices for different numbers of passengers, so it seems unlikely to be able to hitch a ride in a car.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\",\n",

If you arrive with the suburban train, you can take the buses 608, 643 or N43 until stop ''Michendorf, Abzweig Wildenbruch'', you follow the old main street for 50 meters and then go right into ''Feldstraße'', after 600 m you see on your left side a green wall, which has a door in it, that is the way to [[Michendorf Nord]].  Some buses end in Michendorf-West, then you have to leave the bus at Saarmunder Straße''\\n\\nThe path to [[Michendorf Süd]] is at the B2 behind the motorway, by bus you reach there with buses 643 or N43 until ''Michendorf, Bergheide''.\\n\\nAn alternative to reach Michendorf is to take DB regional train RE7 or OE33 and get off at Michendorf Station. The walk from the station takes around 20 minutes. There are three supermarkets on the way to the [[Autobahn]].\\n\\n====Rastplatz am Stern (Parforceheide)====\\nEven though this is only a rest area and not a proper service station, you can catch quite a few rides here. While most of them are going to Potsdam, you can find many drivers taking a short stop before going South or West. Because it is so close to the city, it is worth trying here first and if it fails, catching a ride to Michendorf which should not be too hard.\\n\\nThere is a gas station on the way, where you can also approach drivers, or thumb at the exit of the city to get to an on-ramp of the L40 in Stahnsdorf.\\n\\n=== North {{Ade|24}}, [[Hamburg]], [[Copenhagen]] or [[Rostock]] ===\\n\\nTake the suburban train (S-Bahn) S8/S4/S85 to the stop 'Pankow-Heinersdorf' close to 'Prenzlauer Promenade' on B109. From the traffic light close to the Autobahn on-ramp (still on B109) it normally only takes minutes until you can find a driver. A 114 leads close after Berlin on 'Berliner Ring' (A 10) which leads after ten minutes to the Autobahn Berlin-Hamburg/Berlin-Rostock. The way here can take one hour from Potsdam as Pankow is in the north of Berlin.\\n\\nAnother good place to try is Raststätte Stolper Heide in the North of Berlin. I got a ride to Rostock within 30 minutes, Hamburg would probably be faster.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n[[Category:Brandenburg]]\\n[[Category:Germany]]\\n[[Category:E30]]\\n\\n[[de:Potsdam]]\",\n",

The bus stop in \\'\\'Ogrody\\'\\' is on the other side of the street when you get off the tram. Get out in \\'\\'\\'\\'\\'Dopiewiec\\'\\'\\'\\'\\'. The ride takes about 40 minutes. \\nYou can also take a mini bus of private company [http://www.skorzewo.pl/forum/sprawy-lokalne/bis-trans-rozklad-jazdy Bis Trans] which goes from the same spot in \\'\\'Ogrody\\'\\' to \\'\\'Dopiewo\\'\\' which is next village after \\'\\'\\'\\'\\'Dopiewiec\\'\\'\\'\\'\\'.

Take a local train (KM/REG) from Poznań Główny (central station) to [[Zbąszynek]] or [[Zielona Góra]] and get out after 12 or 14 minutes in [[Palędzie]]. From the station walk along the railway on Kolejowa street (going west). At the end of the street turn left on Pocztowa. At the end of this street turn right on Ojca Mariana Zelazka. 250 meter after the last houses you turn left on an unpaved fieldroad with willow trees. This fieldroad brings you to the toll plaza. \\n\\n THIS METHOD DOESN\\'T WORK ANYMORE!.THERE IS A HIGH FENCE BETWEEN THE ROAD AND THE FIELD , AND THERE IS A POLICE STATION NEAR THE TOLL PLAZA.

Walk back East along the road for 100m or so, then South along a road (turn right (along Szkolna?) for less than a km. You\\'ll come to the A2 motorway - before the crossing and just over a meter high fence to the West (on your right) you\\'ll find a rest station. There are only toilets and so little traffic, but I got a ride by asking in under 10 minutes. Did this in July 2018 on the advice if a local.\\n\\n====Bus stop on \\'\\'Głogowska\\'\\' street====\\n{{Coords|52.3764|16.8722}}<br>\\nGet to \\'\\'Górczyn\\'\\' (last stop of trams 5, 8, 14 and many buses). From there walk over the rail tracks by bridge and go straight for about 800m. Behind the second traffic lights there\\'s a bus stop where you can hitch. There\\'s no point of going further as expressway starts just a few hundred meters behind the bus stop. This expressway is a main road linking city center with motorway A2 from the west. There are also two petrol stations nearby where you can ask drivers. From the same spot you can hitch towards Wrocław so make a sign.\\nA lot of local people will go to Komorniki, the first suburb of Poznań in that direction, where there are a lot of shops like Auchan (supermarket) and a McD. Often you will hear the recommendation that from there you will easily find a lift to the A2, but actually this is not true. Most traffic is coming from the A2 and is going to the center of Poznan. \\n\\nIf you happen to be stranded on that McD, you can also walk towards \\'\\'Głogowska\\'\\' road, just under the bridge, there\\'s a lane in direction of [[Świecko]], that some locals take. You can either take this and go to [[Berlin]] directly or hitchhike until the toll plaza, which will be a much easier option. \\n\\nIf you plan to go to Germany, it is also a good possibility to catch a ride to Warszawa, get out at the toll box and change the side. Once on the motorway it will be very very easy to catch a ride to Germany because there is no big city inbetween Poznan and the border and if a car here stops for you, you can be quite sure it crosses the border.\\n\\n====Marii Lange Roundabout====\\nINFO AS OF WINTER 2022: Get to \\'\\'Górczyn PKM\\'\\' (last stop of tram lines 3, 5, 14 and many buses). From there take bus no 704 or 710 to the stop \\'\\'Konopackiej\\'\\' or 703, 705, 180 to \\'\\'Sycowska Centrum Handlowe\\'\\' (the bus stop is just by the mall). Walk towards the McDonald\\'s sign, it\\'s visible from both of the stops. You will get to a roundabout where people get on and off the highway. There\\'s a grass patch by the entry road to the McDonald\\'s, you can stand there with a sign, your back turned to the McDonald\\'s. People will stop on the parking lot or in the middle of the road that\\'s behind you so make sure to check once in a while. It\\'s relatively easy to catch something here, usually doesn\\'t take more than an hour. From the same spot you can also hitchhike east towards [[Łódź]] and [[Warszawa]] and south towards [[Wrocław]] and [[Kraków]] so make sure to bring a sign!\\n\\nGo to \\'\\'Ogrody\\'\\' (last stop of trams 2, 7, 17, 18 and many buses) and take bus no. 61 direction \\'\\'Krzyżowniki\\'\\'. Get out at the ninth stop called \\'\\'\\'\\'\\'Ul. Wichrowa\\'\\'\\'\\'\\' and walk along the road for about 300 m then you will see petrol station and McD\\'s. Ask drivers there or stay on the road with sign or thumb. Also about 100 m after this place is a bus stop so it\\'s more convenient for drivers to stop their car.\\n\\n \\'\\'Comment by a local: It\\'s more convenient to get off at a stop named \\'\\'\\'\\'\\'Smochowice\\'\\'\\'\\'\\'. You can hitch hike from there or (what i usually do) hitch until the bus 01 (going through \\'\\'\\'\\'\\'Sady\\'\\'\\'\\'\\', don\\'t mess it up!) arrives.  Get  on the bus, buy a ticket to Tarnowo and get off after you pass Sady. It\\'s probably the 2nd stop after Sady, as far as i know the name is \\'\\'Marianowo\\'\\' (i\\'m not 100% sure about it though). You will notice it since it\\'s a perfect  place to hitch-hike: there are 2 lanes instead of 3, you are visible from a far distance and there is a lot of space for a car to stop. On your left side there will be a forest, on the right side there are few houses, in front of you there will be a board which indicates, that it\\'s the road towards the Pl - D boarder.\\n\\'\\'\\n\\n \\'\\'Comment by J.N.: Just ride bus 01 to Tarnowo Podgorne instead of confusing yourself over which bus goes through Sady. Ride/walk along the main road through Tarnowo Podgorne until the end of the village where there is a roundabout on which the local road joins road 92 going to Pniewy and Swiebodzin. You can hitchhike on the roundabout. The businessman who picked me up told me he and his colleagues prefer using this road over the highway as there are much less traffic jams due to roadworks and trucks\" (10.8.2011)\\'\\'.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Łódź]], [[Warsaw|Warszawa]] {{Apl|2}} {{E|30}} ===\\n====Roundabout Rataje====\\nGet to \\'\\'Rondo Rataje\\'\\' (roundabout). There are plenty of trams and buses going there. You can hitch just behind it, on a dual carriegeway (the one without tram tracks). There\\'s no emergency lane or bus stop, but drivers generally stop there, and you may even expect some competition there, as it\\'s popular spot for students hitching back from school. From the same spot you can hitch southeast towards [[Katowice]], so make a sign.\\n\\n This spot is not good, I got stuck here for several hours with another hitchhiker until I gave up and took the bus. The stop appears like it should be a very good one but no one will stop. Not recommended. (08/2016).\\n\\n====Junction Poznań Luboń====\\nIn the city centre, just in front of the castle there\\'s a bus stop called \\'\\'Zamek\\'\\'. From there take a bus 71 in the direction \\'\\'Osiedle Dębina\\'\\' and get off at the end. Go along the main road till you get to the motorway junction. You can ask at the red lights for a lift to the nearest petrol station on A2 (MOP Krzyżowniki), which is just before the junction Poznań Wschód (exit for S5 towards Gniezno). Ask: \\'\\'stacja benzynowa A2\\'\\' (pronounce statsya benzenova ah dva).\\n\\n====Toll plaza Gołuski====\\nSee direction Berlin, then just go to the other side of the motorway.\\n\\n====Marii Lange Roundabout====\\nINFO AS OF WINTER 2022: Get to \\'\\'Górczyn PKM\\'\\' (last stop of tram lines 3, 5, 14 and many buses).

From there walk along the road about 100 m and you will see Orlen petrol station. You can either ask drivers at the station or hitch at the end of it where is a place for cars to pull over. \\n\\n This spot at the road is ok, but traffic is going a bit fast (70km/u). [[User:Worldhitchhiker|Worldhitchhiker]] stood there for more than an hour. After that he moved to the petrol station and asked people, then I got a lift within 15 minutes to a gas station at the highway (04/2019).\\n\\nOptionally you can walk along the same road and after 200-300m you will see a bridge and Volkswagen factory. Hitch straight after the bridge on the bus stop (there is plenty of cars and trucks who are going by inner bypass around Poznan, so many of them are going for a longer distances, and you may avoid local traffic like it\\'s possible at the first place mentioned).\\n\\n=== Northeast towards [[Bydgoszcz]], [[Toruń]], [[Gdańsk]] {{National Road Number Poland|5}} {{E|261}} ===\\nTake bus no. 73 direction \\'\\'Janikowo/Ogrodnicza\\'\\' from place called \\'\\'Rondo Sródka\\'\\' and get out after 11 stops (about 15-18 minutes) at bus stop called \\'\\'\\'\\'\\'Bogucin Bałtycka\\'\\'\\'\\'\\'. Hitch on this bus stop, it\\'s on the road to Gniezno, Bydgoszcz and Gdańsk just after junction with Poznań bypass. You should notice railways nearby and crossed Poznań sign (end of the city zone). Notice that if your driver goes to [[Gnizeno]], make sure you exit before the city, since the road becomes a motorway inside the city and there is no good spot to be found.\\nUPDATE: If going north, e.g. to Gdańsk and your driver continues straight ahead to Gnizeno, ask to be let out just before the big new highway crossing to the west of Gnizeno. There is a bus stop where even trucks can stop, whereas the crossing itself is not very busy and the cars go much to fast. Morsch, August 2018.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Piła]], [[Koszalin]] {{National Road Number Poland|11}} ===\\nFrom city centre e.g. \\'\\'Rondo Kaponiera\\'\\' take tram 9, 11 to \\'\\'Piątkowska\\'\\' and get out at the last stop. From there go north along \\'\\'Piątkowska\\'\\' street to the first junction, then turn west (left) and go to roundabout \\'\\'Rondo Obornicka\\'\\'. On roundabout turn north again (right) and enter national road no. 11 (you will see hipermarket Carrefour next to you). You can hitch after roundabout or anywhere along \\'\\'Obornicka\\'\\' street where is a place to pull over. There\\'s almost always traffic jam, so cars go slowly, which helps hitchhikers.\\n\\n=== Northwest towards [[Gorzów Wielkopolski]], [[Szczecin]] {{National Road Number Poland|92}} ===\\nSee direction Berlin by national road 92 as it\\'s the same spot.\\n\\n=== South and southwest towards [[Wrocław]] {{National Road Number Poland|5}} {{E|261}} and [[Zielona Góra]] {{National Road Number Poland|32}} ===\\n====From bus stop on Głogowska street====\\nSee direction Berlin by motorway A2, from \\'\\'Głogowska\\'\\' street as it\\'s the same spot.\\n\\n====From the village of Szreniawa==== \\nGet to \\'\\'Górczyn\\'\\' (last stop of trams 5, 8, 14 and many buses). Then take a bus 703 to the station AFTER \\'\\'\\'\\'\\'Szreniawa\\'\\'\\'\\'\\' (aproximatelly 25 min by bus from Górczyn). After getting off you can easily catch a car in the direction of Leszno, Wrocław. Get off the bus, walk back a few meters, turn right and walk down the path for about 200m to a bus stop where you can hitch.\\n\\n====Marii Lange Roundabout====\\nSee direction Berlin or Warszawa/Łódź by motorway A2, same spot.\\n\\n=== Southeast towards [[Ostrów Wielkopolski]], [[Katowice]] {{National Road Number Poland|11}} ===\\nSee direction Warszawa by motorway A2, from behind roundabout \\'\\'Rataje\\'\\', as it\\'s the same spot.\\n\\n== Public Transport ==\\n\\nThe city has efficient public transport system with daytime trams and buses operating from 5.00 till 23.00 and nighttime buses and one tram running every half an hour. In Poznań you can not buy tickets at the driver, you can get them in newsagents (kiosk) and grocery shops, and there is more and more ticket machines on the stops. The most convenient way is to buy the tickets directly in the [https://jakdojade.pl/poznan jakdojade.pl] app. Some buses and most of the trams have ticket machines inside the vehicle and you can buy tickets there, but prepare coins. A 15 minutes ticket costs 4 PLN (December 2022). If you travel a lot by public transport, the most cost-effective option is a 24-hour ticket, which offers unlimited rides for 24 hours and costs 15-20 PLN. There is a 50% student discount (\\'\\'ulgowy\\'\\' ticket) upon showing a valid student ID. You have to scan paper tickets when entering the bus/tram, the scanners are yellow and usually located near the doors.  Drivers don\\'t care if you have a ticket and all the doors are open on stops, but there are controllers checking tickets from time to time. They\\'re dressed in civilian clothing and usually don\\'t care about any explaination you might have. For riding without a valid ticket you will be fined from 140 to 280 PLN. \\n\\nTip: if you buy a 24-hr ticket on a Friday after 8PM, it will be valid all weekend until Sunday midnight.\\n\\nThere is a good [http://jakdojade.pl/Welcome.jsp?locale=en website] showing you how to get from one point to another by public transport in major Polish cities.\\n\\n== Eating ==\\n===Traditional===\\nIn Poland you can find many places called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_bar milk bars] or dairy bars (bar mleczny) where traditional Polish and Eastern European cuisine are sold. They are subsidized by the state and city authorities, so the prices are very low.\\nNames and locations:\\n* Caritas - Plac Wolności \\n* Pod Arkadami - Plac Cyryla Ratajskiego 10\\n* Przysmak - Ul. Podgórna 2 \\nNormally they are open till 18.00 or 19.00. \\'Apetyt\\' is open until 22:00.\\n\\n===Other===\\n* Chain of diners \\'\\'Piccolo\\'\\'. Cheap pasta/faux-italian dishes. 9PLN for a small serving. (tons of locations, type \"Piccolo\" in Google Maps to find the nearest one)\\n* Chain of diners \\'\\'Gulliver Bar\\'\\'. Cheap pasta and rice dishes, they have vegetarian options. 8PLN for a small serving. (rynek Łazarski 11, Kraszewskiego 9b, Słowiańska 53B, Plac Ratajskiego 6, Marcelińska 94)\\n* There\\'s a lot of sketchy looking Kebab restaurants all around the city. Not the best quality but it\\'s a good option if you need a hearty meal for a reasonable price. One of the most popular and cheapest is the \\'\\'Zahir kebab\\'\\' chain. Most of the places are open til late night and carry vegetarian options (falafel). As for winter 2022, you generally shouldn\\'t be paying more than 16PLN for a small kebab. \\n* If you\\'re truly desperate for a hot meal, a chain of corner stores named Żabka operate in Poland. They are open 6:00-23:00 and located basically everywhere. You can buy a hot-dog for 5PLN or a reheated panini for 10PLN. \\n===Free Food===\\n* Every Saturday at 17:30 there\\'s a soup kitchen for those in need at the tram stop Dworzec Zachodni PST. It\\'s called Zupa Na Głównym. \\n* Poznań has a branch of Food Not Bombs, an anarchist organization distributing food. They give out free meals for everyone on Sundays at 16:00, by the Stary Marych monument on Półwiejska street. \\n\\n===Bars and Nightlife===\\n* Really cheap shot bar called \\'\\'Czupito\\'\\' on one of the corners of the Old Market Square. Warning, it\\'s pretty packed on weekends.\\n* Cheapest beer in the city, bar \\'\\'Pomidor\\'\\' (pol. \"tomato\"), Długa 7. \\n* Neighboring clubs \\'\\'Mustang\\'\\' and \\'\\'Pod Minogą\\'\\'. Good drinks, often live music, overall nice place to sit down and chat. \\nNowowiejskiego 6 and 8 respectively. \\n\\n== Links ==\\n* [https://www.facebook.com/groups/autostoppoznan/ Facebook group] for Poznan hitchhikers\\n\\n[[Category:Poland]]\\n[[Category:E30]]\\n[[Category:City\\'s]]\\n[[pl:Poznań]]\\n[[fr:Poznań]]\\n{{Cities Poland}}',\n",

From here, take bus 221, 303, 304, 344, 353, or 398 to the bus-stop \\'\\'Na Kovárně\\'\\'. Walk east along Náchodská  ≈600m to the junction with Bořetická. Turn right on Bořetická and walk 1.2km to just over the motorway bridge. Take the path to the right here into the service station. There usually isn\\'t very much traffic, but waiting times are likely to be short. If you get lost ask anyone for \"Hummer Garden\" (the place only for Hummers) which is just behind the station.\\n\\n==== Option 2: K+R (Parking Area) Černý Most ====\\nTake metro line B (yellow) to the end station \\'\\'Černý most\\'\\'. There is the K+R (Park & Ride) to the right (east) of the station which is popular with hitchhikers and possibly a better choice than option 1. It\\'s necessary to use a sign because the road splits in many directions, e.g.  \"HK\" (Hradec Králové) or \"PL\" (if going to Náchod and Poland).\\nThe disadvantage of this option is that there are only cars traveling out of Prague and not those coming from Prague ring road. However, there is no non-freeway solution to get a lift for those cars.\\n\\n\\n=== Northeast towards [[Mladá Boleslav]], [[Liberec]], [[Görlitz]] {{Dcz|10}}{{E|65}} ===\\n[[File:Stop_hk.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Dj-bobr at the beginning of D11 Highway.]]\\n\\n==== Option 1: Motorway service station on E65 ====\\nTake metro line B (yellow) to the last station \\'\\'Černý Most\\'\\'. From there catch bus number 220 to the stop \\'\\'Do Čertous\\'\\'. When you get off the bus, the petrol station is behind the big orange building with \"H1\" on it.\\n\\n==== Option 2: K+R (Parking) Černý Most ====\\nTake metro line B (yellow) to the end station \\'\\'Černý most\\'\\'. There is the K+R (Park & Ride) to the right (east) of the station. Lots of hitchhikers use this place. Use a sign \"MB\" (Mladá Boleslav) or \"LB\" (Liberec). It\\'s necessary to use a sign because the road splits in many directions. Due to the construction of sections of the Prague Ring (R1), long-distance traffic is lower each day; however, this spot is still usable.\\n\\n\\n=== Northwest towards [[Ústí nad Labem]], [[Teplice]], [[Dresden]], [[Berlin]] {{Dcz|8}}{{E|55}} ===\\n\\nIf you are passing through Dresden, take a look at the [[Dresden]] hitchwiki page. From either of the spots you can take rides to OMV petrol station before Lovosice or to the Agip petrol station after Ústí nad Labem. The hitchhiking positions there are also good.\\n\\n==== Option 1: D8 ====\\n\\nTake metro line C (red) to \\'\\'Holešovice\\'\\'. From here, take bus 201 to \\'\\'Vychovatelna\\'\\' (3 stops). You will find a great spot with lots of traffic still going slow right at the bus station. \\n\\nThe author had not noted that there are three lanes on this road, and the two inside lanes take the cars to Dresden. The bus lane of course is great and the cars are not going too fast, but anyone going to Dresden on this road would need to cut across a few car lanes to come pick you up. Quite possible but there are better options than this.\\n\\n==== Option 2: OMV petrol station / Mcdonalds on D8====\\n\\nOption 1 walking\\n\\nTake metro line C (red) to \\'\\'Letňany\\'\\'. Keep walking northwest along Tupolevova for 500 m, crossing over Beranovych to the pedestrian crossing at the traffic lights. Cross Tupolevova here and keep heading southwest on the pathway leading onto Opocenska. Walk ≈250 m along Opocenska and you will see a small footpath to the right (before the pedestrian/cycle bridge over the highway) heading straight to the OMV petrol station (≈150 m walk).\\n\\nOption 2 metro + bus\\n\\nTake metro line C (red) to \\'\\'Letňany\\'\\'. Take bus 195, 140, 158, 110, or 269 to the stop \\'\\'Obchodní centrum Čakovice\\'\\'. Turn back in the direction the bus came from and walk ≈1km along Kostelecká (past the roundabout) until you reach the sliproad coming off the D8. This is just before the bridge over the D8. Turn left into the sliproad and after walking ≈100m, you will come to the petrol station (with a McDonalds behind it).\\n\\n\\n=== West towards [[Plzeň]], [[Klatovy]], [[Nürnberg]], [[München]] {{Dcz|5}}{{E|50}}===\\n\\nMost drivers go directly to Plzeň. However, getting a direct lift to Germany or even further is not unusual. All petrol stations on the {{Dcz|5}} are fine for hitchhiking although often with little traffic.\\n\\n==== Option 1: Rozvadovská spojka ====\\n\\nTake metro line B (yellow) to \\'\\'Hůrka\\'\\'. Turn left (west) out of the station and then turn north towards the Albert supermarket. Walk around the left side of Albert supermarket heading up and then over a small bridge until you reach a school. Walk around the school on the left side, heading north, until you reach Běhounkova. Walk ≈ 30m north along Běhounkova until you see the gap in the wall on the left - cut through the parking place and take the path through the gap and you will reach the large bus stop on Nárožní. Cross it and continue to the intersection with Bucharova. Turn left on Bucharova - you will see signs to \"Plzeň\". Go over the bridge and turn left down the entry slip road to Rozvadovská spojka. After the bend, there is a great place for hitchhiking: lights, straight, hard shoulder with lots of space to stop. Although it\\'s not allowed to stay there, the police don\\'t make any problems here.\\n\\nTake metro line B (yellow) to \\'\\'Nové Butovice\\'\\'. Then take bus 184 (direction Hradčanská) or bus 174 (direction Vypich) and get off at the second stop: \"Šafránkova\". (The stop is a request stop, so it means that you have to push the button in the bus to stop it). Cross over the road (Bucharova) and walk south 200m to the slip road, and continue to the hitching point on Rozvadovská spojka as described above.\\n\\nTake metro line A (green) to end station \\'\\'Nemocnice Motol\\'\\'. Turn right out of the station to the bus-stop. Then take bus 184 (direction Velká Ohrada) or bus 174 (direction Luka) and get off at the second stop: \"Šafránkova\" (the stop is a request stop, so it means that you have to push the button in the bus to stop it). Walk south ≈150m to the slip road, and continue to the hitching point on Rozvadovská spojka as descibed above.\\n\\n==== Option 2: Motorway service station Rudná ====\\n\\nTake metro line B (yellow) to \\'\\'Zličín\\'\\'. Then take bus 307, 308, 311, 380, or 602 to stop \\'\\'Rudná, škola\\'\\'. (The ticket costs 18 Kč, ≈€0.66; 1 zone out of Prague). Walk 60m back in the direction the bus came from and turn left into Na Přídělu street. You should see the petrol station in the distance. Walk 350m to the end of the street. There will be a footpath towards the petrol station 150m away. You need the opposite direction so get to the other side of motorway by the tunnel under the motorway on the right.\\nIt\\'s a fairly big service station with McD and enough cars.\\n\\n==== Option 3: Motorway junction at Zličín ====\\n\\nTake metro line B (yellow) to the terminal station \\'\\'Zličín\\'\\'. Go under the road Řevnická and turn immediately left. Continue south along Řevnická for 150m to the crossroads with traffic lights. You can stand right at the triangle down on Rozvadovská spojka (police can kick you out) or ask people at the nearby petrol station, KFC, or parking lots. None of these places are good (Options 1 and 2 are better).\\n\\n\\n=== Southeast towards [[Brno]], [[Ostrava]], [[Bratislava]], [[Vienna]], [[Kraków]] {{Dcz|1}}{{E|50}}{{E|59}}{{E|65}} <br />& South towards [[České Budějovice]], [[Linz]] {{Dcz|3}}{{E|55}} ===\\n\\nIt\\'s good to have a sign at this road and definitely for direction south. Every bigger petrol station on [[D1 (CZ)|D1]] is good for hitchhiking.\\n\\n==== Option 1: Motorway service station on E65 ====\\n\\nTake metro line C (red) to \\'\\'Chodov\\'\\'. look for the big shopping centre  and enter, keeping to the ground floor, locate the exit consisting of stairs and elevators (not to mention a lift that leads below); this exit leads to the bus stops. \\n\\nHead on outside and turn right, follow the path and cross to the SONY building. Now keeping on the same road walk for 20mins and you\\'ll reach the SHELL petrol station.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can stay past the station exit at the end of the left lane, on the left side of the road.\\nEasily reachable petrol station, not a lot of traffic though and is sometimes enforced by a employee in Shell uniform. Has cover for in bad-weather or snow conditions. In all honesty this station seems iffy.\\nThere isn\\'t much traffic on both gas stations. Both are not advisable.\\nYou can try standing at the ramp to the motorway just outside Chodov Mall. First go inside, to floor 0. Walk to the easternmost part of the mall, there use the elevator to floor -2. In the parking house, walk east to the exit. There\\'s the ramp.\\n\\n==== Option 2:  Motorway Junction Opatov====\\n\\nTake metro line C (red) to \"Opatov\". Walk south ≈800m along Chilská past the crossroads and over the motorway bridge to the beginning of the entrance slip road. Instead of walking, you can take bus number 177 from metro \"Opatov\" to next (request) stop \"U Dálnice\" and then walk 100m east to the beginning of the slip road. Now you might see other hitchhikers on the slip-road.Be careful and stay on the slip road, not on the motorway (sometimes police passes by).<br />\\n\\n==== Option 3: 5.května at the beginning of expressway ====\\n\\nThe beginning of the motorway has been shifted a few hundred meters back into the city center, thus it is now illegal to use this spot. \\n\\nYou can still use the petrol station, but indeed the amount of cars going in the direction of Brno is very small here.\\n\\nThe sign showing the start of the expressway (and also 50km/h speed limit) is located 1.3km from the original location, on 5.května just before it passes over Vyskočilova, so legally it should be possible to hitch before it. At this spot there is a wide shoulder, lights, 50km/h speed limit. Take metro line C (red) to Budějovická. From exit on Budějovická street, turn left some metres and then turn right (northeast) on Vyskočilova. Walk northeast ≈350m until the exit slip road on the left just before the 5.května overpass. Cut across the grass embankment and walk up to 5.května itself and you will see the expressway sign. This spot looks good, but \\'\\'\\'it needs to be tested.\\'\\'\\'\\n\\n==== Option 4: Motorway service station Újezd u Průhonic) ====\\n\\n[[File:ujezdupruhonicprague.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Hitchhikers at Újezd u Průhonic petrol station. Regular local hitchhikers were around, as well as hitchhikers doing the race.]]\\n\\nTake metro line C (red) to \\'\\'Opatov\\'\\'. Exit straight out of the station and take a lift following the winding red ramp up to street level/the road above. From the bus-stop next to the Replay shop, take the bus X122 to the final stop \\'\\'K Sukovu\\'\\' (buses leave every 15-30 minutes). As it is in the \"P\" zone, usual fares and SMS-tickets apply. Continue along the main street which will turn kind of right into Formanská and 20 m ahead it splits into left and right. Stay on the right hand/main road, cross the bridge over the highway and on the right there is a pathway going down to the McDonald\\'s + gas station on the higway. The best jackpot a hitch hiker can hit. <br />\\nThis is the first motorway petrol station past Prague, the best hitchhiking spot but takes some time to get there. Also, you have to have a valid ticket for the bus trip!\\n\\n==== Option 5: Beginning of main road 5.kvetna ====\\n\\nTake metro line C (red) to \\'\\'Vyšehrad\\'\\'. Head south using the sidewalk for about 300m. After the small bridge, continue left to the main road 5. kvetna. There are 3 lanes and one parking lane and usually some place to stop.<br/ >\\nThis spot quite near the city centre and cars are going slow, high traffic density, and nobody expects hitchhikers there but you can be lucky.\\n\\n==== Option 6 ====\\n\\nTake metro line C (red) to \\'\\'Roztyly\\'\\' and cross all the parking places to the motorway. Hard shoulder there is good and lit at night; however, it\\'s not allowed to stay there and cars are already moving quite fast.\\n\\n==== Option 7: Uhříněveská Highway Entrance and Gas Station in Průhonice ====\\n\\nThe below is more written in warning than recommendation, as a spot that is possible but hardly ideal. Where Uhříněveská crosses beneath the highway in Průhonice there is a gas station, Čerpací Stanice AGP in Googlemaps. [[User:movethathoof|Movethathoof]] went there looking for a ride while Option 4 above was closed, and found it //very// quiet: little traffic, and the entrance to the gas station is from lanes that are separate from the highway, for cars that are otherwise exiting there onto Uhříněveská. That said, there is a regular trickle of trucks that pass through, many heading to Nuremburg and Wrocław (though not Vienna, where they were). Still, by asking everyone who stopped they before long did find a ride with two Germans who were headed to Vienna.\\n\\nThey also tried at the highway entrance there from Uhříněveská, which was useless. While the spot has good space to stop, and the traffic is not moving fast, 90 minutes there only taught them that the traffic is mostly local and the area must be //very// well off, to judge by the number of expensive sports cars there entering the highway and driving past. As well, if planning to be there once autumn really begins to bite, there is a large retaining wall right where you\\'ll stand, casting a very deep shadow, making it feel much, much colder after some time waiting!\\n\\nTo get there, the instructions are similar to option 4 above: take metro line C (red) to Opatov, exit to the street level bus stop directly above, and then instead take either the 363 or 385 buses (the bus driver may ask you to pay the 12 crown add-fare for where you\\'re going). At least the bus Movethathoof took was nice and new, announcing (by voice and on a nice screen showing the coming stops, no less) the stop: you get off at the Průhonice roundabout (stop name Průhonice), and then walk five minutes up Uhříněveská (which is the street that makes the T-intersection at the round about, a left turn from the road and in the direction the bus travelled on from Opatov). The onramp will be right there on your right, and there is either a little path to the gas station, or stairs at the underpass (there were also truckers stopping simply to make purchases at the Lidl that is right there, the stairs being the more direct route between the two).\\n\\n\\n=== South towards [[Příbram]], [[Písek]], [[České Budějovice]] {{Dcz|4}} ===\\n\\nTake metro line B (yellow) to \\'\\'Smíchovské nádraží\\'\\'. Then take bus 129, 241, 243, 244, 314, or 318 to the stop \\'\\'Malá Chuchle\\'\\'. (It\\'s a request stop so press the button). There you can easily hitchhike. Usually very short waiting on Friday afternoons when many people go out from Prague.\\n\\n\\n=== West towards [[Karlovy Vary]], [[Cheb]] {{Dcz|6}}{{E|48}} ===\\n\\n==== Option 1: Karlovarská street ====\\n\\nTake tram 22 to \\'\\'Bílá Hora\\'\\'. Walk 50 m west along Karlovarská street to past the red/white railings and there is a quite good place to hitch-hike.\\n\\n==== Option 2: Motorway junction D6 Jeneč ====\\n\\nTake a train from \\'\\'Prague Masarykovo\\'\\' to \\'\\'Jeneč\\'\\' (15 km out of Prague and very close to Prague Airport). Walk down the embankment onto Průmyslová ulice from the station. Walk north along Průmyslová ulice ≈350 m under the railway tracks to the motorway junction from which it is pretty easy to get to [[Karlovy Vary]].\\n\\n==== Option 3: Motorway service station D6 ====\\n\\nTake metro line A (green) to \\'\\'Hradčanská\\'\\'. Then take bus [http://www.tram-bus.cz/stredni-cechy/autobusy/linka-310610 310610] or [http://www.tram-bus.cz/stredni-cechy/autobusy/linka-310082 310082 (B82)] from bus-stop \\'\\'Praha-Hradčanská\\'\\' and get off at \\'\\'Velká Dobrá, u skoly\\'\\'. Follow the direction of the bus and turn first left (Unhošťská street), than second right (Lesní street) and after 200 m you should see the highway and the petrol station on your right.<br/ >\\nThis option is good if you prefer petrol stations although it is quite far (30 km from Prague centre).\\n\\n\\n=== Northwest towards [[Kladno]], [[Chomutov]], [[Chemnitz]] {{Dcz|7}} ===\\nTake metro line A (green) to \\'\\'Dejvická\\'\\'. Then take bus 119 from bus-stop \\'\\'Dejvická\\'\\' to \\'\\'Dědina\\'\\'. You can hitchhike at the bus-stop. You can also try another bus stop on Evropská road, e.g. \\'\\'Divoká Šárka\\'\\', but probably further out is better.\\n\\n\\n== Public transport ==\\n\\nPublic transport network in Prague is really good, you can get in reasonable time almost anywhere at any time. Ticket costs: 30 minutes - 24 Kč (eur 1), 90 minutes - 32 Kč (~eur 1.30). If you plan to stay longer, you can buy a ticket for one day - 110 Kč (~eur 4.50) or three days - 310 Kč (~eur 12.60). You have to validate ticket when entering metro station, tram or bus. The fine for fare dodging is 800 Kč (~eur 32) if you pay it at that place or till15 days.\\n\\nAt metro stations you can find maps of Prague with public transport, this can be useful, because the lines are changing (especially bus lines). You can easily find a connection online at [http://jizdnirady.idnes.cz/pid/spojeni/?lng=E IDOS] - works for the entire CR or alternatively for Prague only: [http://spojeni.dpp.cz/ConnForm.aspx?cl=E5 DPP].\\n\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n{{Cities Czech Republic}}\\n{{Highways CZ}}\\n\\n{{hitchbase_city|92}}\\n\\n__NOTOC__\\n\\n[[Category:E48]]\\n[[Category:E50]]\\n[[Category:E55]]\\n[[Category:E59]]\\n[[Category:E65]]\\n[[Category:E67]]\\n\\n[[de:Prag]]\\n[[tr:Prag]]\\n[[fr:Prague]]',\n",

When walking away from the center towards the TESCO supermarket, you will see traffic lights. You can hitchhike immediately after the lights. The road to [[Košice]] has a lot of traffic and waits are rarely longer than 10 minutes. Write an H in circle or HU for [[Hungary]], or a KE sign for Košice.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Humenné]], [[Ukraine]], North towards [[Bardejov]], [[Rzeszów]] ([[Poland|PL]]) {{European Route Number|371}} ===\\n\\nTake trolleybus #1 from the train station (''Železničná stanica''). Get down at very last stop. On the right side of the street there is a good place to hitchhike. This is quite a busy road with many trucks going to Poland or Ukraine.\\n\\nYou can get somewhat further out of the city by taking bus 20 in the direction ''Ľubotice''. Get off at the stop ''Stražnicka'' and walk forward into the same direction as the bus until the end of the street. Turn left, walk further and then turn right. The busy road you see ahead of you is the E371, and you can hitch from the bus stop at the intersection.\\n\\nThe road splits after the village of Kapušany. Write a PL sign for Poland (via the [[Barwinek-Vyšný Komárnik border crossing]]), BJ sign for [[Bardejov]], SK for [[Svidnik]], or HE for [[Vranov nad Topľou]], HE for [[Humenné]].\\n\\n== Public transport ==\\nIt is possible to cross from one end of the city to the other by public transport in about 40 minutes. An adult ticket for a bus or trolleybus is 0.50€. It is best to buy a ticket, because ticket controls are strict and controllers may bring the police in to take your personal information from your ID or passport. But it's the most they can do. They cannot force you to pay and unless you're a Slovak (or Czech) resident, you can throw the fine into the trash can.\\n\\n[[Category:Slovakia]]\\n[[Category:D1 (Slovakia)|D1]]\\n[[Category:E371]]\\n\\n__NOTOC__\",\n",

The city of Pskov serves as the administrative center of [[Pskov Oblast]].\\n\\n== Hitchhiking through ==\\n=== North towards [[St. Petersburg]] ===\\nIf you are coming from the South along the M20 (from the South of [[Latvia]] or [[Belarus]], there is no need to enter the city itself. Your driver might bring you to the crossing of the M20 with the ''Krestovskoe Schosse'', where traffic turns west into Pskov. You will recognize some old Sovjet monument and a lot of street dogs (at least at night) on the right. Get out here and walk up along the street. Hitchhiking is possible everywhere, though maybe just before the railway bridge might be useful. Behind the bridge you'll also find a petrol station. About 4-5 km north there's also a police post located, those are great for hitchhiking.\\n\\nIf you are coming from [[Riga]] along the E77 you have to get to the M20 as well. There is a kind of by-pass north of the city, but you have to cross part of the city anyway. Coming into Pskov on the first bigger crossing go left and follow ''Yubilejnaya Ulitsa'' (after the bridge ''Chudskaya ulitsa'') for about 3km, then turn left. Here you could start hitching. After another 2km you have to turn right on the by-pass which leads onto the M20 after 10km. Basically you have to follow the signs for [[St. Petersburg]] (or until the by-pass also towards [[Gdov]] if there are are no signs for Petersburg). Where the by-pass joins the M20 cars have to slow down and you can easily hitch a ride. However, it might be easier to cross the city and to try to get to the above mentioned ''Krestovskoe Schosse''.\\n\\n=== Experiences ===\\n* [[User:Platschi|Platschi]] hitchhiked in front of the bridge at 04:00 and got a ride easily, though be aware of the dogs and the crazy woman screaming all over the railway station's soundsystem.\\n\\n{{Subdivisions of Russia}}\\n\\n[[Category:E77]]\\n[[Category:E95]]\",\n",

There is a car/train ferry port with ferries to [[Rødby]] in [[Denmark]]. \\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== North towards [[Rødby]], [[Denmark]] ===\\n\\n[[File:Puttgarden ferry waiting lines.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Cars and drivers waiting to get on to the ferry, great for finding a ride to [[Copenhagen]] or even far up north into [[Scandinavia]]]]\\nUsually hitchhikers can get over for free because every vehicle can take 9 passengers with it, so there might be place for you anywhere. If you are searching for a lift you should tell people about this possibility – otherwise they might not take you with them just because they think it\\'s too complicated or they\\'ll have to pay. The employees at the entrance said it\\'s not allowed to hitchhike on their facilities, but [[User:Swaden|Swaden]] ([[User talk:Swaden|talk]]) did it anyway and no one bat an eye. If they don\\'t let you, you can always hitchhike with a sign during the day but then it might be more complicated to explain the free thing. If you hitchhike at night, there will be less cars so don\\'t hesitate to directly stop them and explain that you\\'re out of their live as soon as you board into the ferry!\\n\\nYou can probably easily find a ride to [[Copenhagen]] or [[Malmö]] in [[Sweden]]. The ferry passage for foot passengers is expensive and the price is the same even at night (around 20 EUR for Rødby). You can also ask rides to people on the ferry.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Lübeck]], [[Hamburg]], [[Berlin]]===\\n\\nIf you\\'re coming from [[Denmark]], you can try to find a car on the ferry that might bring you somewhere on the motorway. Ask everyone you can on the boat (first ask if they\\'re driving) and if you\\'re not lucky, one option is to stay on the boat to go to Denmark and then back, and try again. Nobody will ask you anything, this hitchhiker tried it for a few back-and-forths. If still not lucky, you will probably try to hitch a ride where all the cars are leaving the ferry. It\\'s always a lot of cars at once when a ferry arrives and then nothing for the next 30 minutes. There is also a ARAL service station 1–2 km away, where you might be lucky, too. Everyone leaving Fehrman will pass the station, often rather slow because of all the cars leaving the ferry.\\n\\n\\nWhen you want to get to Berlin, try to catch a ride before you pass Lübeck onto the A20, then A14 or onto the A24 (attention: there is the national road B404 which most drivers use to get from the A1 onto the A24, check googlemaps). If you are unlucky you ultimately can hitch to Hamburg and go to the Horner Kreisel (at the end of the A24 in Hamburg) or a service station close to it.\\n\\n=== At night and/or if you\\'re stranded ===\\n\\nIt is difficult that someone will stop for you at night after they leave the ferry (especially as it\\'s a crazy rush and probably in this case people who would otherwise stop, in this case won\\'t). At night your best chance to get some sympathy and maybe a ride is to ignore the no-pedestrians sign at the exit side, and go try to talk to some truckers who might be there (if their blinds aren\\'t closed). Some may be resting for one hour, others will stay the night. If they\\'re staying the night you will have to find a place to rest. But read right next.\\n\\nIf you get stranded for the night then there is a wonderful place for you to crash. Look for a door near those gates where cars and trucks leave the ferry (the place you cross to go talk to the truckers). That door gives access to another door and then to a well-heated and well-lit corridor that has access to the police office as well as the Scandlines office. At the end of the corridor to the right there is a heater. Probably there will even be something on the floor for you to lie down. Just do it. Use your sleeping bag. Nobody there will find it strange, it seems to be common enough. Regulate the heater to your preference. If anybody asks, just say you\\'re waiting for someone who\\'s arriving in the morning. Nobody asked me anything. By the way, this was a trucker\\'s suggestion who also gave me the next suggestion about trains.\\n\\nAlso, if you\\'d like to take the train for free and you don\\'t feel guilty about it: at around 5.00 in the morning the first train leaves. With information from another person this hitchhiker took a chance and rode without a ticket, to Lübeck. And then in Lübeck this hitchhiker took the train to Hamburg. Verdict: as said by the \"informant\", there are no ticket checks in the first hours of the morning. Plus, if you\\'re not a national, you can just ask for the invoice to go to your home and ignore it.\\n\\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n[[Category:Schleswig-Holstein]]\\n[[Category:E47]]\\n[[Category:Ferries]]\\n[[Category:Germany]]\\n\\n[[de:Puttgarden]]',\n",

Being almost 2000 years old, Pécs is the cultural centre of the surrounding county of \\'\\'Baranya\\'\\' and a long standing melting pot of numerous different cultures.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== North towards [[Budapest]] ===\\nWhen hitchhiking from \\'\\'\\'Pécs\\'\\'\\' to [[Budapest]], take the [http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/M60-as_aut%C3%B3p%C3%A1lya_(Magyarorsz%C3%A1g) M60] motorway, it is just finished and local hitch-hikers use it frequently. Take the bus 41 until the last stop /Reménypuszta/, there\\'s the 58th road. Follow it for 500 meters and you\\'ll find the toll to Budapest.\\n\\nAnother possibility to go on main road 6th, until Szekszárd, there you can take the M6 as well. The reason to take the main road rather then the highway directly from Pécs: the highway is a big detour compared to the road 6. The road 6 goes across the Mecsek (a hill north of the town), the M60 starts from the south of the town, bypasses the Mecsek, it is about 40 km longer between Pécs and Szekszárd. \\n\\nProbably there is bigger chance to get a long distance lift from the M60, but many local students prefer the 6th road.\\n \\nTo get to road 6th, you have to take the bus 2 until /Budai Vám/ there is a large Tesco, you cant miss it. Actually, you can, because there are 2 large Tescos in Pécs, and the other one is on the opposite side of the town - watch out when asking! If you are at the Tesco at \"Budai vám\", you have to walk towards about 500 m, there will be a slight slope, at the bottom there is a petrol station (just for toilet, water, or what ever you need), and a bus stop, where drivers can stop to pick you up.\\nIf you walk about hundred meters more, you are just out of town, which is also a very good place to hitch a ride. \\n\\nMaybe the bus stop is better, because you get in the drivers sight early, when they are the top of the slope, and they watching you until they reach the bottom. Plenty of time to decide!\\n\\n=== South towards [[Osijek]], [[Sarajevo]] (57 {{E|73}} {{E|7}}) ===\\n\\nTake local bus 20 or 20A (in front of the big shopping mall Arkad) to the last stop. Walk to the main road, which is the 57 and hitch south in the direction of Mohacs. Eventually you\\'ll hit a roundabout where you can either go straight into the city of Mohacs or right towards the [[Dubosevica-Udvar border crossing]] with [[Croatia]]. Head towards Udvar, this is not the road E73/7. Rides are a bit sparse here and most heading that direction are actually heading into a back road of Mohacs, not to Udvar. So if your ride drops you off here, you\\'ll have a more select audience if you walk a bit until you cross a bridge and pass the small road to Mohács on the left.\\n\\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\\n\\n[[nomad:Pécs]] [[trash:Pécs]]\\n\\n=== Inland ===\\n\\nYou can also leave the town by bus or train. The bus \\'\\'(\"Autóbusz-pályaudvar\")\\'\\' and the railway station \\'\\'(\"Főpályaudvar\")\\'\\' are both located southwards from the inner town (10-20 minutes walk).

It is also one of the eldest city in [[North America]] and [[Canada]] renown for its historic centre and fortification but also for its proximity to the nature. Quebec city has a reputation as one of the safest place to be in country, violent crime is absent and scams are rare. Therefore the population is tolerant and trusting toward hitch-hikers and the police, usually easy-going unless you act like a fool.\\n\\nQuebec city has one of the highest proportion of highway km/inhabitants in its metropolitan area. This has accentuate an easy commuting for the workers making the journey from the suburbs and surrounding counties. Therefore, hitching from Quebec city to the rural surroundings should usually be really simple as many commuters does travel nearly 100km every day between their home and the city and as such, hitching becomes a great alternative for those willing to see the countryside.\\n\\nEven if hitching along the highway is \\'de facto\\' illegal, it is still pretty common in the Greater Quebec region and would be tolerated at a certain point (once in the rural areas). Hitching in the urbanised metropolitan would NOT be tolerated at any point due to safety reasons. Hitching along the [[on-ramp]] would be no problem unless safety cause problems for drivers, which is the case in a few places.\\nFor that purpose, Do not walk trying to hitch along the following Urban Boulevard or Highway (stick to ramps):\\n* [[A-73 (Quebec)|A-73]] (Autoroute Laurentienne/Autoroute Henri-IV) \\'\\'dense traffic, accident common\\'\\'\\n* [[A-40 (Quebec)|A-740]] (Autoroute Du Vallon/Autoroute Robert-Bourassa) \\'\\'curvy highway used as a \\'urban racetrack\\'\\'\\'\\n* [[A-40 (Quebec)|A-40]] (Autoroute Charest) between exit \\'Rue Jean-Gauvin\\' and the end of the highway (\\'Rue St-Sacrement\\') \\'\\'(dense traffic and no shoulder)\\'\\'\\n* [[A-40 (Quebec)|A-540]] (Autoroute Duplessis) \\'\\'(no shoulder)\\'\\'\\n* [[A-40 (Quebec)|A-40/A-73]] (Autoroute de la Capitale) \\'\\'dense traffic\\'\\'\\n\\n\\n== East to [[Charlevoix]] on [[Route 138 (Quebec)|Route 138]] (St. Lawrence North Shore) ==\\n\\nThe first attempt will be to get out of the urban area and join the road [[Route 138 (Quebec)|138]] east in the Beaupré County. Several spots might be possible to hitch out of the city but some might be better than another:\\n\\n* It would be possible to try out directly from downtown at the location of the defunct viaduc in the area of the \\'Gare du Palais\\', Justice Hall and St-Roch Mall by starting at the beginning of the [[A-40 (Quebec)|highway 440]] or eventually starting at some other point on the on-ramp along this highway (called: Autoroute Dufferin-Montmorency).\\n** On-Ramp: Rue d\\'Estimauville (Beauport borough), accessible with bus #10 (at the edge of the Maizeret Park)\\n** On-Ramp: Boulevard François-De Laval (Beauport Borough), at footsteps of bus #53,#251 or bus #800\\n** On-Ramp: Rue Vallée (Beauport Borough), at footsteps of bus #53,#251\\nNote: for those willing to walk, this highway following the St-Lawrence shore is paralled with a linear park including a cycling path, at some spot it might even be possible to try out on the highway itself if there is some road shoulder.\\n\\n* Another try would be to take bus #800 until its terminus and start hitching at the on-ramp leading to the [[Quebec highways|A-40]] East which is at few footsteps of the terminus (Boulevard des Chutes - Beauport Borough). From there, the vast majority of the car should be heading outside the urban area (some might still be heading downtown though) and you should be able to get a ride to around the Ile d\\'Orléans bridge or maybe even further.\\n** Unless you plan to make a stop by in the Beaupré County, you should be careful where you stop by if you catch a ride until there, as the \\'Boulevard Ste-Anne\\' (Road 138) is well reputed for its high rate of deadly accident and dangerous spots, try to stick to the on-ramp, entrance of shopping mall or place of interests and make sure to be well visible but especially that there is enough space for a car to pull over without being hit by another incoming car. If you can get a ride all the way until the Mont Ste-Anne Ski Resort, you would have managed to cross the whole county and be at the edge of Charlevoix Region.\\n\\nGoing East from the Western part and attempting to cross the whole urban area would be possible in condition of sticking to the highway [[Quebec highways|A-40]] which does a pseudo-periphery loop in the North (Called \\'Autoroute de la Capitale\\'). It would therefore be useful to manage a ride until the borough of Charlesbourg or Beauport to start further East at a on-ramp. Avoid stopping anywhere before the junction of the [[A-73 (Quebec)|A-73]] (Autoroute Laurentienne) in the urban area itself as all on-ramp are either local and industrial traffic or motorway junction with main inner city boulevard.\\n\\n== Going North, to Saguenay/Lac-St-Jean area along [[A-73 (Quebec)|A-73]] ==\\n\\nHitching North is rather difficult, but not impossible. Two options first to get closer to a hitch location: \\n\\n1) Take bus 801 to the corner of De La Couronne and Du Châlutier. There is an Ultramar gas station on the corner where you can attempt to hitch. Very average location however, as folks whom would like to pick you up will have to park in the gas station, and loads of local traffic.\\n\\n2) Take bus 801 up to the Zoo terminal in Charlesbourg. Then, take bus 31 or 32 to the crossing of Henri-Bourassa, Notre-Dame and De la Durance (just before an underpass, ask the driver if necessary). Go under the underpass and find an Ultramar gas station with Subway and Salvatore Restaurants. Then, hitch in the onramp or close to the highway (beware the police station within 1 km)\\n\\nBeware however, the 31 and 32 busses have very low frequency, especially during weekends. If it\\'s not possible for you to get them, walk on Boulevard Henri-Bourassa until Rue Georges-Muir. Turn left and go set yourself up in the highway entrance 155 (175 North). Very little traffic, especially local. However, that would be your best bet. If the folks you meet do not go up to Saguenay, ask if they can drop you off at the Petro-Canada gas station just before the entrance of the park. From there, everybody should at least go to Laterrière / [[Chicoutimi]].\\n\\n== West to [[Montreal]] along [[A-40 (Quebec)|A-40]] ==\\n\\n<map lat=\\'46.79797360085845\\' lng=\\'-71.2532901763916\\' zoom=\\'15\\' view=\\'3\\' float=\\'right\\' />\\n\\n* \\'\\'\\'Starting point in Quebec City\\'\\'\\'\\nThe best options are to either look at \\'Local Hitching Section\\' on this page or try one of the following:\\n\\n\\n* (EDIT : As of Sept. 2 2010, this spot is being demolished and it is not known yet what it will become. I recommend that you find another location. If you do find one, please add it here!) Corner of Route St-Sacrement and Boulevard Charest (at the start of the [[A-40 (Quebec)|highway 440]]) before the street light or at one of the Gas Station located at its corner. To reach this spot, you would need to take bus #7 (which rides on Chemin Ste-Foy), step off at the St-Sacrement Church stop and walk down the hill. Note that many cars riding on [[A-40 (Quebec)|A-40]] will simply reach until [[Trois-Rivières]] which is a halfway breakdown on the highway to [[Montreal]]\\n\\n\\nIt is most likely that your first ride will leads you into the western rural [[Portneuf]] County which is a good start (unless you catch a long-distance ride). If you make it further enough into the County (let\\'s say after Cap-Santé - Exit 269) you may try to hitch directly along the highway if you feel the need. Anyhow, your first ride out of Quebec city should always at least manage to take you to the following exit:\\n\\n* Fossambault / St-Augustin - Exit 295\\n** From there you can consider yourself out of the suburban area, and may hitch a ride further west from the on-ramp.\\n\\n* Donnacona - Exit 274\\n** 24h Off-Motorway Services (Tim Hortons, Gas Stations, Bars) and one may manage to talk to people directly, note that the on-ramp is not lighten and located in the \\'wild\\'. The people from that area are usually quite of friendly approach so no worries to go ask for information or help at any time.\\n\\n* St-Marc-des-Carrières - Exit 254\\n** Last Off-Motorway Services before [[Trois-Rivières]], which consists of a truck stop with restaurant, gas station, and snack bar. The highway on-ramp is just by the gas station.\\n\\n== West to [[Montreal]] or [[Ottawa]] along [[A-20 (Quebec)|A-20]] ==\\n(EDIT: tried this route in December 2011, got to Ottawa via Montreal faster than the Greyhound)\\nAssuming you are starting in the centre of Quebec City for me this was in the heart of Vieux Quebec. Get ready for a moderate walk. Take Rue Saint-Jean South West until its name changes to Chemin Ste-Foy at this point head Right on Rue de l\\'Aqueduc heading underneath and overpass. You will soon arrive at Blvd Charest Ouest, a busy commercial street. Turn left onto Charest Ouest, and Follow this street 2.1km South West. You will arrive at a point where the road obviously feeds to the highway. There is a bus stop \"Charest Ouest / Cyrille-Duquet\\u200e\" and a Tim Hortons on the right hand side. This location is perfect, the bus stop offers cover if it is raining and drivers have 2 opportunities to safely stop for you after you have been spotted. Also, many drivers will pull into the Tim Hortons to grab something before they get on the highway heading West. The drive through exit is directly behind where you are standing and drivers also have a good view of you as they leave the Tim\\'s.\\n\\n== East through [[A-20 (Quebec)|A-20]] (St. Lawrence South Shore) ==\\n\\n==== Crossing to [[Levis]] ====\\nIt\\'s quite hard to hitch directly from Quebec city in direction east by the south bank of the St-Lawrence.

The starting places will most likely be the same as for any other long distance hitching, although with an appropriate sign it could even be faster, some specific places includes the colleges and university area where many workers and students will return home at rush hour. \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Where else to start:\\'\\'\\'\\nThe main Colleges and University area are located in the borough of Ste-Foy and the amount of students and workers commuting there is brushing the 30 000 people (Université Laval, College Garneau, College Ste-Foy) and the local biggest mall is also located there (Place Laurier). The main bus line passes there (#800, #801, #7, #93). The starting points includes:\\n* Universite Laval/Place Laurier:\\n** Corner Boulevard Laurier/Boulevard Du Vallon (direction North/East or West)\\n* College Ste-Foy:\\n** Corner Chemin Ste-Foy/Boulevard Du Vallon (direction North/East or West)\\n** Rue Nérée-Tremblay/Boulevard Versant-Nord (on-ramp to A-40, direction North/East or West)\\n* Place Laurier:\\n** Corner Chemin Quatre-Bourgeois/Autoroute Henri-IV (on-ramp, every direction)\\n** Boulevard Laurier interchange jonction (direction North/South or West)\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Destination to go:\\'\\'\\'\\n* [[Portneuf]] County (West)\\n* Beaupré County (East)\\n* Jacques-Cartier County (North)\\n* [[Levis|Lévis]] Urban Area and Lotbinière County (South)\\n\\n== Public Transport ==\\n\\nPublic transport ([http://www.rtcquebec.ca/ RTC]) in Quebec consists of a reliable bus network downtown and on the major boulevard which becomes less frequent in the suburbs. The main arterial network is the Metrobus #800-801 that head North and West from Quebec downtown.\\n\\nThe bus network is not that cheap and can\\'t be cheated as you need to either pay (whom doesn\\'t carry changes! So he will take what you give) or handle your ticket to the driver. The fare to pay on the bus is higher than if you\\'re a ticket holder, so avoid not having a ticket which are for sale in every convenient store. The fare system is a bit prehistoric and does not offer any flexibility, but once you have handled your ticket to the driver, you can ask for a transfer allowing you to continue your journey on another bus network but which can not be used as a return. Beware that buses called \\'express\\' only let passengers out at a suburbia terminal. \\n\\nIf you need to reach the south shore of the St. Lawrence to [[Levis|Lévis]]. The bus service has its own ticketing system, the [http://www.stlevis.ca/ South Shore] ([[Levis]]) bus network, which comes to a few key spot in the city.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Night Buses:\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nThis said, one great thing is that Quebec city\\'s bus network offer an extensive night service from Thursday to Friday with bus running until 3am on certain route. Hitching within the city might actually work if you stand at a bus stop and try while the flow of the traffic is not too big, most of the locals despise the public transport system and might be keen of saving you off it!\\n{{IsIn|Quebec}}\\n\\n[[Category:Canada]]\\n[[Category:Quebec]]\\n\\n[[fr:Québec (ville)]]',\n",

It is within walking distance of [[Büdelsdorf]], [[Schacht-Audorf]], [[Westerrönfeld]], [[Osterrönfeld]] and [[Fockbek]].\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\nWhile there are no almost no known personal experiences, hitchhiking is definitely possible here, especially over short distances (i.e. towards [[Kiel]] or [[Eckernförde]]).\\n\\n=== All directions ===\\nLikely the best spot to get onto any of the highways is the Q1 gas station on the B202 in [[Osterrönfeld]]. With a little bit of patience, one should at least be able to get towards South, with a little luck also towards North, as the B202 continues towards the highway interchange between the A7 and A210. Only drawback: I'm not sure how to get here on foot. However, take a look at the section towards East below, which explains one possible spot to hitchhike to this station.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Flensburg]], [[Schleswig]], [[Eckernförde]], {{Ade|7}} ===\\nIn order to get north, for example onto the {{Ade|7}}, you should try your luck on the B203 in [[Büdelsdorf]]. The roundabout at the end of the city is in theory a good spot, but cars cannot really stop there. If you go a bit further, you should be able to find little roads to fields, which are better suited. There are also two gas stations before you exit the city (Classic and Jet), where you can also ask the drivers directly, however most of the traffic is likely not leaving.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Kiel]], {{Ade|210}} ===\\nTo go to Kiel, you can probably find a spot on Berliner Str. The intersection right next to the Esso gas station has a lot of traffic and is close to the B202, but also still deep inside the city. You can probably ask for a ride there, but most of the traffic will be local. There are bus stops closer to the B202, but I can't tell if they are good.\\n\\nAnother option is to check the spots in [[Osterrönfeld]], you just need to cross the canal by tunnel or ferry.\\n\\n== Public Transport ==\\nBlackriding on the buses is almost impossible unless the driver's cabin is empty or closed off (due to Covid). Usually, the drivers take a break at the central station and you can get in unseen, but there is still a possibility that they will ask for your ticket when they come back. There are however no dedicated ticket inspectors.\\n\\n== Accommodation and Sleep ==\\nIt should be possible to find decent places to camp near the Eider river and the canal. Try checking Google Maps for spots with a sufficient amount of trees and stay away from houses. It is likely more suitable to camp on the Büdelsdorf side of the river as well as the other side of the canal (crossable by tunnel or ferry). In both cases there is a good possibility to meet people walking their dogs in the morning. Ironically, you're likely to be left alone at parking spots for commuters.\\n\\n== Other useful info ==\\nThere are several places downtown offering free wifi, such as the Rondo, Sparkasse, McDonalds, Backwerk or the city library.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n[[Category:City's]]\\n[[Category:Schleswig-Holstein]]\\n[[Category:Germany]]\\n[[de:Rendsburg]]\\n{{IsIn|Schleswig-Holstein}}\",\n",

You can get off here and head to the roundabout round the corner and hitch from there. There are also budget grocery shops nearby (Bónus, Krónan) which sometimes give free food away.\\n\\nYou also have the possibility to get further out of the city by taking bus 57 or 29 to Esjurætur with the same bus ticket.\\n\\n=== Direction: East along Route 1 (Vik, Höfn, etc.) ===\\n\\nOnce again, you will first need to get out of the center. A good spot to start is next to a large Olis gas station on the edge of town. Bus no. 5 from the Hlemmur Bus Station will get you there (280 IKR). Ask to get off at the Olis station on Norðlingabraut street, and you can ask the bus driver for a hitching spot - some of them know. Then get on to Route 1 and wave your thumb. Once you start going East, you can get wherever you want.\\n\\n\\n=== Direction: West ([[Keflavík]], Airport) ===\\n\\nCatch bus 1  ( or bus 34 if that is more conveniant) from Reykjavik to Hafnarfjörður (280 ISK) which stops for 5 minutes at the main bus station in Hafnarfjörður and then proceeds further into Hafnarfjörður (Bus 1 \"Hfj. Vellir\"). Get off at the stop Suðurhvammur, from there it looks like a regular highway onramp, but actually it is not a highway, so while you can hitch directly then and there on the onramp it is generlly quicker and easier to just walk onto the main road and walk along that road for a 100 meters or 200 meters until you find a place where cars can pull over.\\n\\nHitchhiking from the city directly is not the easiet.\\n\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[[de:Reykjavík]]',\n",

You can find three ramps here: ''Rheine-Nord, Rheine and Rheine-Kanalhafen.''\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== East towards [[Hörstel]], [[Ibbenbüren]], [[A30 (Germany)|A30]] (Ramp ''Kanalhafen'') ===\\n* If you are in the city, there are no real good spots towards the [[A30 (Germany)|A30]] ramp ''Kanalhafen''. If you are at the central station you can walk along the ''Kardinal-van-Galen-Ring'' towards [[Ibbenbüren]], walk over the ''Ems'' river and go right into the ''Osnabrücker Strasse''. Here you have two choices: You can walk till the end of town where you'll find an ''Aral'' petrol station, or try to hitchhike somewhere along the way at a bus stop. There's not much space for cars to stop because many are parking next to the road and the street is quite small. It is recommended to walk around 1 km along the ''Osnabrücker Strasse'' and try it then at the ''Persiluhr'' where some space to stop cars is situated, or some meters further at the crossing with the ''Friedrich-Ebert-Ring''. Whatever, just try to hitchhike, if you have no luck walk until the end of town, if there nobody stops it's just around 2-3 km to the ramp. A sign saying [[A30 (Germany)|A30]] might help you a lot! \\n* You can also take a bus to the ramp, it's going twice a day towards [[Hörstel]]: Take line #192, it's starting at 6:36 a.m. and 1:16 p.m. at the central station in '''Rheine'''. Get out at ''Hafenstrasse / Kreuzung L501'', and walk along the ''L501'' for around 1 km over the bridge towards the ramp. Maybe the bus drives you to ''Rheine-Rodde / Am Backhaus'', that's directly at the ramp. Just ask the bus driver, because he'll definitely stop there on his way back! For further information, download the time table [http://wb.eurocit.com/content/wb/sendtimetable.php?id=34 here].\\n\\n=== West towards [[Amsterdam]], [[A30 (Germany)|A30]] (Ramp ''Rheine-Nord'') ===\\n* A better solution for going west would be the ramp ''Rheine-Nord''. There's a bus stop directly next to the ramp. Ask at the bus station which bus is going towards ''Rheine Nord'' or direction ''Spelle''. This ramp is only good for hitchhiking towards the [[Netherlands]] or onto the [[A31 (Germany)|A31]], but forget it for hitching eastwards. There's quite a lot of space for you to stand for direction [[Netherlands]], even a traffic light with a button to push so you can force cars that are going onto the motorway to stop. The ramp in the other direction is bad, no hard shoulder to stand on, and fast traffic.\\n\\n=== South-West towards [[Neuenkirchen (Westfalen)]], [[Ochtrup]] ===\\n* If hitchhiking through the countryside (it's worth it!), and your starting point might be the train station in '''Rheine''', use this way to get out in direction south-west: Walk down under the bridge on the left if you leave the station. You'll recognize a pub with a guitar outside and a record store on the right. Walk along this street (''Bahnhofstrasse'') until the next traffic lights, there turn right. Go uphill for some 300m, along a service station, until you cross with the ''Neuenkirchener Strasse''. On the right, you'll recognize another service station, called ''Pludra''. Here now turn left and follow the whole ''Neuenkirchener Strasse'' for some 800-900m. At some point, you'll find a JET service station. Just behind there are some big traffic lights, and 10m behind the lights you'll find a big bus bay for starting your hitchhiking trip. Good spot with much traffic that's passing by slowly. From the train station until this spot, you might walk some 10 minutes.\\n\\n[[Category:North Rhine-Westphalia]]\\n[[Category:E30]]\\n[[Category:A30 (Germany)]]\\n[[Category:Route Amsterdam - Berlin]]\\n[[Category:Germany]]\",\n",

You have to take bus #2 and travel to the stop Diračje near motorway junction 5 on the west side of the city. Then go straight along the main road. On the left you\\'ll recognize a sing for Pula, Trieste, Ljubljana. You can hitchhike there by the signs (ignore \\'\\'no autostop\\'\\' signs, it\\'s very hard to have problems with police) on the beginning of the motorway or you can go to Crodux petrol station 1 km direction Italy,  walk to  Andrije Mohorovičića street cross it by tunnel and walk a gravel road on opposite side  of highway and than cross it back by petrol stations bridge)\\n\\n\\n=== Direction [[Zagreb]], [[Zadar]] and [[Split]] ===\\n\\nIf you want to go to Dalmatia  (Zadar, Split etc.), you can try it directly from Rijeka, but it is easier to first get to Zagreb (to the Lučko ramp) and continue to Dalmatia from there.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\'  Crodux petrol station / Mcdonalds / parking\\n\\nYou have to take bus #2 and travel to the stop Diračje near motorway junction 5 on the west side of the city.

This is a bit tricky, it is difficult to see which bus goes where. Your purpose is to get as close to the \"Main statue\" as possible. This is a huge monument next to the highway, 2 km before the on-ramp and the tollbooth. Go to the Delta bus terminal, which is in the centre of Rijeka, 500m away from the theatre \\'\\'HNK Ivana pl. Zajca\\'\\'. Take bus #12, #14 or #16. It is a good idea to check timetables before (see below at the section about public transport). Ask the driver to leave you near the main statue or the tollbooth. With bus #16, he can leave you directly at the statue. With bus #12, it is not sure - ask the driver to bring you as close to to the statue and the highway as possible. [[User:Onmyown]] says it takes 3 km from the stop of bus #12 to the hitching spot. With bus #14, get off in Cavle, and change to bus #15, which also passes by the statue. You can also get off in Cavle and change to bus #15 with buses #12 and #16. Bus #15 takes quite a long time to get from Cavle to the main statue - first it makes some detours to go into some beautiful Croatian villages.\\n\\n[[File:Main_statue_rijeka.jpg|thumb|200px|The main statue close to the option 1 hitching spot]]\\n\\nFrom the statue, you have to walk 2 km along the local road, but you can already start hitchhiking here, sometimes locals help and pick you up. At the on-ramp, you can choose to hitchhike directly, or walk 200m forward on the highway to get to the toll gate. On the ramp waiting time will be max. 20 min. but in general you wait there for a few minutes.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'B\\'\\'\\' Go to the main bus station in Rijeka and catch a bus going to Zagreb. Just tell the driver to drop you off at the tollbooth (about 20km from Rijeka). Offer him about 15 or 20 Kuna.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3\\'\\'\\' \\n\\nGo to new road near a port. There you can stay after lights, which are on the crossroad of Brajdica street and Šetalište Andrije Kačića Miošića. There is a lane from where cars have to go out, so there is good place to catch a car.\\n\\n\\n=== Direction [[Pula]] and [[Istria]] in general ===\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nBus again but on another bus terminal which is across the \\'\\'HNK Ivana pl. Zajca\\'\\' theatre. You have to catch bus #22 or #23 (direction \\'\\'Matulji\\'\\'). Of course ask the bus driver to leave you on a bus stop near the petrol station \\'\\'Euro Petrol\\'\\' in \\'\\'Matulji\\'\\'. On the left side of petrol station you will see the road which guides you to the main spot. Name of the spot is \\'\\'Dina restaurant\\'\\' and there you have a really good place for hitchhiking. In case of rain or something like that you can always refresh yourself in the restaurant. From the petrol station to the spot you have to walk for about 10 to 15 minutes.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nTake the bus #32 to Opatija. You can find the schedule [http://www.autotrolej.hr/default.asp?ru=90&gl=200505190000003&sid=&jezik=1 here]. Ask a driver to drop you off the nearest possible to the BILLA supermarket in Opatija. When you see the supermarket, walk 3-4 minutes to the East. It seems illogical, but don\\'t worry. [https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Nova+cesta+62,+51410,+Opatija,+Hrvatska&daddr=Nova+cesta+51,+Opatija,+Hrvatska&hl=hr&ll=45.344009,14.312857&spn=0.006002,0.006491&sll=45.343794,14.311951&sspn=0.003001,0.003245&geocode=FVjkswIdQ13aACnVQWI-fqhkRzEAYTA2edF71w%3BFa7qswIddmfaACmz9DFhgKhkRzEodJVubJJKmA&t=h&mra=ls&z=17 Map] is here. Point A is the supermarket, point B is the parking lot. The parking lot makes it easy for drivers to pull over. DON\\'T put a sign, because Istria is in the opposite direction. When someone pulls over, you have to ask if they are going towards the tunnel (Croatian: prema tunelu) That gets you on the way to the Istrian highway, famous Istrian Y.  When you get dropped off, you can start using a sign.\\n\\n\\n=== Direction [[Ljubljana]] and [[Slovenia]] ===\\n\\nOne of the best options to get to the border and in general towards Ljubljana is to take a train from the main train station in Rijeka. You have to pay max. 3 Euro for a ticket to \\'\\'Ilirska Bistrica\\'\\' Slovenia and after an one hour train ride you can walk from the train station to the main spot. Ask local people there and they will show you how to get there. It\\'s a 5 to 10 minute walk from the train station. When you reach the spot you can easily get a ride to Postojna and then Ljubljana. \\n\\nSecond option: see the \"Direction Trieste and Italy\". But the first one is much more better and easier.\\n\\n\\n=== Direction islands [[Krk]], [[Cres]] and [[Losinj]] ===\\n\\nIf you are going to islands Krk, Cres or Losinj, the best option is to take a bus #29 to Kraljevica and then take a walk for about 2 kilometers until the Krk bridge. There is very easy to catch a hike to the island Krk as most of the people on the island are hichhiker friendly because of expensive bus ticket and bad connections within the cities. If you are going to the islands Cres or Losinj, you can start your hichhike on the same position near the bridge, and ask for a hichhike until the Valbiska, small port on the island from which ferries are going to Cres. Losinj is connected with the bridge with the island Cres so the procedure is the same for going there.\\n\\nKeep in mind that you can also take a cheap catamaran boat from Rijeka to islands Cres and Losinj. It is advisable to check the prices before.\\n\\n==Sleeping==\\n\\nIt\\'s good idea to sleep on beach. Spoken with locals, they said it\\'s illegal to sleep in beach but nonone cares. Good place outside the city is near Pajol Bar Pecine coordinates: 45.312300, 14.473445  I asked bar staff, they said people sleeping here no problems at all. Leave early at morning\\n\\n\\n==Eating, drinking==\\n\\nOne of the best options to get some cheap food is to go to student mensa (Index) and ask some student if you can borrow X-ica (student card). Probably best option is to arrange it in front by [Couchsurfing, since lot of couchsurfers in Rijeka are also students. There you can get the whole meal for as little as 5 kunas (around 0.60 eur). If you want to make your own food, market offers some cheap vegetables and fruits, as well as some good choice of fish in nearby fishmarket. Best option for buying there is to come around 11am. Most of the shops close after noon, so then is tendency for prices to go down.\\n\\nFor drinking, very good option is [http://www.klubmladihrijeka.hr/ Klub Mladih], near Serbian embassy. You can get some very cheap drinks there and fast free internet. Keep in mind that you need to be member there (membership is free) so take your document to make your membership card. If you want just cheap coffee, check caffe bar Pin in the centre.\\n\\n\\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\\n\\n[[trash:Rijeka]] [[nomad:Rijeka]]\\n\\n\\n__NOTOC__\\n\\n[[Category:E65]]\\n[[Category:Croatia]]\\n[[Category:E61]]',\n",

The stop is located around 300m behind the toll booths and it's a perfect lay-by to pull in a car or truck. The bus ride to this spot takes around two hours, but you're well behind the metropolitan area of Rio, practically in the countryside. Next to the bus stop there's a restaurant and supermarket. In case of bad luck you can walk to Posto Big Dutra with Petrobras petrol station located two kilometres up the road.

It´s probably best to ask the cars queueing in front of the ticket booths, or before they buy them at the ticket offices. Drivers pay for their car regardless of the amount of passengers, and they can add passengers to their ticket at the booths. The queues are much shorter in the winter so it´s harder to speak to the drivers before they get to the booths. If you´re going to Copenhagen you can also hitch to Sweden, Trelleborg, then across across through Malmo into Copehagen. These ferries go less often and have longer queues for hitching, but the journey takes several hours. If no one picks you up, the passenger fee of EUR 7.50 is reasonable. As a pedestrian you have to catch the pedestrian-passengers-bus 30min before departure, so be there on time. On the 1hr 45min trip, you can ask other drivers if they are going in your direction.

A sign is a must. \\n\\n====Option 3====\\n\\'Knooppunt Kleinpolderplein\\' at the A20. Walk a little bit with the bicycle path 50 mtr and you can hitchhike just before the sign that shows you are entering the highway. It is a 10 minutes walk from \\' Diergaarde Blijdorp\\' , the zoo. A sign is a must and probably also technically speaking illegal. I had to wait 30 min. for a car with the sign \\'Utrecht\\' but a sign with \\'Eerste Benzinestation\\' will do even better probably.\\n\\n====Option 4====\\n{{Coords|51.9669|4.5901}}<br>\\nBest spots are often at a BP \\'\\' de Vink\\'\\' petrol station on the highway, one could also choose to take the train (direction Utrecht, Leewarder, Groningen, Zwolle, Uitgeest or Gouda Goverwelle) or metro (A or B direction Nesselande or Binnenhof) to Rotterdam Alexander. Here you can take bus 190 to Gouda and get off at Luxemburgsezoom. From here you walk a few meter back to the roundabout and you go right to the bridge over the highway. You do not want to go over the bridge but pass it on the left side. You can walk until the highway and go left to the petrol station. This spot can also be reached from metrostation \\'De Tochten\\', however, a longer walk is necessary.\\n\\n=== West towards [[Hoek van Holland]] and ferries to [[England]] ===\\nThe ferries from the Hook of Holland to England do not often carry trucks and therefore do not always offer free options. To get to the ferry terminal you can blackride the train to Hoek Van Hollland Haven. You can also hitch there from one of the many service stations on the A20 with someone going on the ferry. After speaking to drivers on the A20, most trucks passing through there terminate at the port, which means no free ferry. That being said, you could hitch to where they terminate and continue to [[Calais]].\\n\\nAt the Hook Of Holland you can ride a ferry to [[Harwich]], England. It is hard if not impossible to get across without paying. On the ferry you can ask around to find someone driving to your destination, even walking around with a hitch sign, and possibly start a conversation\\n\\n=== South towards [[Dordrecht]], [[Breda]], [[Antwerp]], [[Lille]] (A16) {{European Route Number|19}} ===\\n====Option 1==== \\nTake tram line 21 (direction De Esch) to the \\'\\'Woudestein\\'\\' stop. Once in \\'\\'Woudestein\\'\\' you need to follow the big road in front of you. Keep walking in the direction of the \\'\\'Erasmus university\\'\\'. If looking for rides at traffic lights is your thing, then there\\'s plenty of opportunity on the way. But if not, keep on going until you reach the motorway which crosses in front of you. It\\'s about a 15 minute walk. The only place to stand now is next to the last traffic light.  Traffic density is quite high but unfortunately so is the speed of the traffic. It\\'s best to have a sign here because although traffic can only be going north or south, there are plentiful exits on the way.\\n\\n====Option 2==== \\n{{Coords|51.9156|4.5157}}<br>\\nShell petrol station south of the city that feeds on to the A16. It is directly to the west of `\\'\\'Oude Plantage, De Esch, Rotterdam, The Netherlands\\'\\'` and is walking distance from Gerdesiaweg Rotterdam train station and from trams. It has good visibility for you and your potential rides and a slip road entering the station where your ride can stop. From the station, head South until you hit the river, then head west (left) and you will see the station on the side of the river.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Berg-op-Zoom]], [[Middelbourg]], [[Antwerpen]], [[Gent]] (A29, A4, A58) ===\\n{{Coords|51.8443|4.5138}}<br>\\nTake tram line 25 to the terminus \"Barendrecht Opstelstoor Carnisselande\".  Walk 5 min. towards left when facing the river.  There is a ramp to get on the A29.  Traffic is slowed down by traffic lights, there\\'s a big emergency lane for the cars to stop and there is also a BP Ziedewij petrol station.\\n\\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n{{Cities Netherlands}}\\n{{Cities Zuid-Holland}}\\n\\n{{IsIn|Zuid Holland}}\\n[[Category:City\\'s]]\\n[[Category:Zuid Holland]]\\n[[Category:E19]]\\n[[Category:E25]]\\n[[Category:E31]]\\n[[nl:Rotterdam]]',\n",

It is a [[France|French]] region, and as such, is a part of the European Union, but not of the [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen space]]. Therefore, citizens of certain countries should check whether they need a visa in ahead.\\n\\nThis makes the island a super expensive place, specially when compared to all countries around. But you might not have to spend a coin! Although there is barely no nomad-hitchhiker-backpacker in the island, Reunion is a hobo\\'s paradise. Hitchhiking, dumpster diving, fruit harvesting, busking and wild camping are a marvel here. \\n\\n== Cities ==\\n* [[Saint-Denis (Réunion)|Saint-Denis]]\\n\\n== Hitchability ==\\nEuropean consumerism hit hard this small tropical island, and the insane number of vehicles and traffic jams are one the island\\'s current major issues. Ironically, combined with the relaxed mood of most reunionnais and \\'\\'zoreils\\'\\' (foreigners), this makes the island a paradise for hitchhiking.  \\n\\nHitchhiking use to be very common in Reunion. Luckily, it didn\\'t disappear completely, and you\\'ll might see reunion youngsters thumbing every now and then. Public transports are rather expensive and unreliable. \\n\\nIt\\'s generally easier to hitchhike at the lowlands (\\'\\'les bas\\'\\'), specially on the west, then in the highlands (\\'\\'les hauts\\'\\').\\n\\n=== The ring road ===\\nOne road goes all the way around the island. It is an expressway from St Benoit (East) northward to St Denis (north) and then to St Paul (West), St Leu (West) and St Pierre (South-West). This road is always easily accessible from the various city centers using the appropriate bus network, hitchhiking, or just walking. You can hitch on the access roads or roundabouts. And you can easily hop from one petrol station (aire de service) to the next.\\n\\n=== The highlands ===\\nThe island has the shape of a cone. From the ring road, you can catch smaller roads uphill that take you in the highlands. Those are overly easy to hitchhike, since they are rather slow.\\n\\nBe careful, it rains easily in the highlands, on the east side in particular.\\n\\n=== Hitchhiking a sailing boat ===\\n[[Hitchhiking a boat|Hitchhiking a sailing boat]] is a good to way to get to in and out of Reunion. The main marina is in Le Port, where you can drop your note at the Capitanerie and La Voilerie (sail repair shop), and expect to walk for kilometers between the new and the old marina. The other marina is in St Pierre, smaller, friendlier and prettier - and you only have one dock to walk.\\nIn september - november, many \"tour-du-mondistes\", coming from Asia and sailing around the world, could be able to take you towards South Africa and South America.\\nFrom December to May is the cyclone season, with much less sailing traffic. \\nAs always with boat hitchhiking, expect to spend anything from 3 hours to 3 months to find a boat! But there can hardly be a better way to travel in these islands as that of those pirates that flourished here in the XVI century.\\n\\n== Resources ==\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n{{Regions France}}\\n{{wikipedia-link}}\\n\\n{{IsIn|Eastern Africa}}\\n[[Category:Island]]\\n[[Category:Africa]]\\n[[Category:Overseas departments and territories of France]]\\n[[Category:Réunion]]\\n[[Category:France]]\\n\\n[[de:Réunion]]\\n[[zh:留尼汪]]',\n",

It\\'s a student City and it\\'s a border city to France, that\\'s the main reason why you wanna get there. \\n\\n== Get there - Quite a hassle ==\\nAccording to lots of people from other German Departments, the \"Saarland\" doesn\\'t even deserve to be German, they say. Some people even think, it\\'s part of France and not Germany. And that\\'s what it feels, if you wanna get there - It\\'s somehow the arse-end of Germany. The only highway that deserves that name (2015) is coming from Mannheim - and if you just check out the map of the highway junctions around Mannheim you might feel dizzy afterwards...\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Coming from Munich / Stuttgart / Switzerland / Austria\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nThis following instructions according to [[User:Windsohn|Windsohn]] who has been living there for some time and hitchhiked quite a lot in and out are only helpful for you if you are used to the highway [[rest area]] hitchhiking style. If you prefer to stand at the highway entrances, that guide is not recommended.

Whe you are on the highway between Stuttgart and Karlsruhe, make sure you get dropped on a service area, like [[Pforzheim]] which is located between Stuttgart and Karlsruhe. There you change the car to a car that goes either directly to Saarbrücken or towards [[Koblenz]], [Cologne[Köln]] or [[Düsseldorf]].\\nThen let you drop down again at the service area \"Dannstadt-Ost\", close to Mannheim and change the car again. This time take a car towards Saarbrücken (if you are veeery lucky) or towards Trier / Luxembourg (what is most likely). Ask them, if the could just take you to the next petrol station which is about 20km from there.\\nAnd this Petrol station, also some kind of service area of course, is called \"Pfalz\" and it\\'s located next to a village called \"Hettenleidelheim\". There you can ask the cars that are heading towards France or towards Saarbrücken. Again - don\\'t take half-ways or you gonna die in the forests of Saarland (Saarland is famous for the most trees per civilist). If the driver is heading towards france: The service area \"Goldene Bremm\" (more below) is the only spot where you can get off, the highway to France is not passing through the city itself.\\n\\n== Hitching Out - Many directions ==\\nThe service area \\'\\'Goldene Bremm\\'\\' on the [[A6 (Germany)|A6]] is the best spot to hitch near the city. You can reach the service area easily by taking bus 123 or 126 to Neue Bremm. Don\\'t confuse it with the Autohof that\\'s nearby, there is a proper highway gas station, too! Take a look at the [http://www.saarfahrplan.de schedule] of the buses. \\'\\' \\'\\'Enter through the back doors of the buses if you don\\'t want to pay, I have been living in Saarbrücken for two years and have never seen anyone controling tickets.\\'\\'\\nWaiting time is 5-30 minutes when heading towards [[Metz]], [[Paris]], [[Strasbourg]]. You can catch a ride even to [[Spain]] or to [[Nürnberg|Nuernberg]], [[Dresden]], [[Leipzig]] or even [[Poland]]. [[User:Zenit|Zenit]] found the service station quite depressing to get rides towards Strasbourg and ended up settling for a ride towards Metz after spending the night and trying to get a ride for about five hours, changing directions at the Longeville service station. \\n\\n=== West towards [[Luxembourg]], [[Trier]] ===\\n\\nGo to the big bridge on Malstatter Strasse. You will notice many cars stopping at traffic lights beside the Luxembourg motorway sign. Approach the cars when they have stopped. I got a lift in less than 2 minutes. \\n\\nAfter 15 KM there is a service station located on the [[Saarlouis]] section of the motorway.

(anonymous hitchhiker)-->\\nNear \\'\\'Plaza de España\\'\\' go to the address \\'\\'Gran Via 41\\'\\', which is under the stone arch walkway just past the post office (Correos). Right in front of that address are a bunch of blue and white signs, one of which says \\'\\'Polígono Los Villares de la Reina\\'\\', línea 25. This is your bus. It\\'s one of the red buses. Make sure you \\'\\'do not\\'\\' take the bus to \\'\\'Polígono Santa Marta\\'\\'. If you continue to where the arches stop there is an electronic sign that says when the buses arrive. This bus will take you through the industrial area with lots of warehouses. When you see the big metal sculpture in the middle of a big roundabout, get off the bus. The sculpture is a metal loop with a curved rod running through it. This is the beginning of the motorway {{Aes|A-62}} towards Valladolid, and there is a big shoulder where cars can pull over easily. ¡Buena suerte compañeros y compañeras!\\n\\n=== South towards [[Cáceres]] {{Aes|A-66}} {{E|803}} ===\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1:\\'\\'\\' Take the bus Linea 11, direction \"Buenos Aires\", get out at the last stop. \\nThis bus will take you to the western most extremities of the city from which you will be able to hitch a ride along the A-62 west and of course the A-66 south.\\nThe best spot to start looking for a ride south would be the one shown on the link below. You have to walk from where the bus drops you towards the highway, jump a fence to reach it and then cross it to the other side, but then as you can see at the left of the map in the link you will find a nice flat land field where cars can safely stop to pick you up.\\n\\nLINK [https://maps.google.com/maps?q=buenos+aires,+salamanca,+espa%C3%B1a&hl=es&ie=UTF8&ll=40.954646,-5.708583&spn=0.001301,0.002044&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=31.646818,66.972656&t=h&hq=buenos+aires,&hnear=Salamanca,+Castilla+y+Le%C3%B3n,+Espa%C3%B1a&z=19]\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2:\\'\\'\\' Has less traffic than option 1. No need to pay anything but it\\'s a bit complicated. Get to the \\'\\'Carretera de Ledesma\\'\\' (SA300) until you reach the roundabout at the city periphery. From here you can already see the motorway {{Aes|A-62}} to which it is another 20 minutes walk. There, you will find enough space to thumb and a shoulder were cars can easily stop.\\n\\n=== West towards [[Portugal]] {{Aes|A-62}} {{E|80}} ===\\nFrom Plaza España, take the bus Linea 11, direction \"Buenos Aires\". This bus will take you to the eastern most extremities of the city from which you will be able to hitch a ride along the A-62 west and the A-66 south. Get out of the bus at the last stop, and follow the signs. You will get to a big roundabout. You can try to hitchhike from there, but there is a lot of cars going in many direction and even the ones taking the turn that says \\'Portugal\\' are mostly going to the local industrial zone. You\\'ll be much better off if you walk 1km next to the road to get to a second roundabout where you can hitch in direction of Portugal. Plenty of space for cars to stop. You\\'re also likely to get a lift to one of the gas stations on the A-62 highway. Talking to people there can get you going much faster and further than hitching by the road (remember, it\\'s Spain).\\n\\nNote: If your ride is only taking you to somewhere near Vilar Formoso border and you want to go further in Portugal, stay at the last Cepsa gas station on the right side of the road, 5kms before the border. Gas is cheaper in Spain, and many cars fill up their tanks in there before entering Portugal. Getting into Villar Formoso can get you stuck there, especially out of tourist season when the traffic is almost exclusively local.\\n\\n=== Est towards [[Avila]] and [[Madrid]] {{Aes|A-50}} ===\\n\\nGo to \"Ctra Madrid\". Just before the centro comercial EL TORMES, there is a roundabout with a bus stop, and cars can either take the A50 or the N501, which both lead to Avila and Madrid. The hitchhiking spot is 30-40 minutes away from the center by foot, but you can also take the bus at Gran Via, to centro comercial el tormes.\\n\\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\\n\\n[[nomad:Salamanca]] [[trash:Salamanca]]',\n",

It lies on the Wasatch Mountain Range, at the edge of the Rockies. Salt Lake City, \"Crossroads of the West\", has always been a transient city and remains transient in modern times.\\n\\nTo differentiate yourself from a tourist, refer to Salt Lake City as \"Salt Lake\" (without \"City\"). Home to the world\\'s largest population of Latter Day Saints (Mormon), Salt Lake City can be conservative at times. So when hitching in, out, or just through, be aware of your appearance if you want to open yourself up to rides from a broader population.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\nDon\\'t waste your time trying to hitch out of the city. Take public transit as far as possible before thumbing it. Pretty cheap to get north to Ogden, south to Provo. Many hotels have free airport shuttles. Play it cool and pretend you\\'re a hotel guest. The airport is right on I-80 if you\\'re looking to head east/west.\\n\\n=== West towards [[Wendover]], [[Reno]] ===\\nThere are a few big truck stops at Lakepoint junction about 10 miles west fo Salt Lake.  You can reach it by public bus from the city. Its ether 451 or 453 (towards Tooele), or another 454 (to Grantsville).  You can take them on North Temple street, just north of the temple square in Salt lake downtown. Its a normal ~$2 bus fare.  Note that there are only a few buses a day, one yearly in the morning and several in the afternoon, so you have to organize yourself.\\nWhen at the truck stops you can try to ask around or make a sign going \"west\".   The spot is not perfect as most of traffic going towards the city, but you might get lucky and someone going the other way will notice you (it took me 4 hours waiting to get a ride to Nevada)\\n\\n==== Personal experiences ====\\n\"I had a different experience than the author of this page, possibly due to being a young woman. First, SLC seemed like a waste of time to hitch from: Love\\'s was under heavy police patrol, I saw a \"lot lizard\" as early as 15:00, and no truckers wanted to pick up a hitcher from an urban area. Got on the bus towards Tooele and was offered a ride straight to Sacramento within 10 minutes of raising a West sign at the Lakepoint Flying J. Also, Lakepoint is a pretty place with a cheap market with lotsa samples.\"\\n\\n=== East towards [[Park City]], [[Wyoming]] ===\\nThere is a decent on-ramp of sorts that leads to Interstate 80 East (I-80) and I-215 South.  You can take bus 21 from downtown to 2300 E 2100 S (near the Blue Plate Diner), and walk on 2100 S toward the mountains, which is about about 15 minutes to Maywood Drive at Parley\\'s Way. There is a Walmart Supercenter across the street where you can buy markers and poster board.  Since traffic goes East or South from here, a sign is necessary - regardless of distance you want to travel, I would just write \"Park City,\" or \"Evantston\" on the sign.  As metioned above, Salt Lake City is somewhat conservative, even the liberals; make yourself presentable.  Twice in the Mid-Afternoon with a bright green sign, I was picked up by commuters, first within 30 minutes, and second time within 10.\\n\\nAnother option to get there is Bus 228 to Foothill / I-80, but I have yet to explore this.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Saint George]] and [[Las Vegas]]===\\nThere is a Flying J in downtown [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake]] if you can find it, but a lot of this traffic is going East/West on I-80, so consider catching a few local rides from the city south past [[Provo]] to the Flying J at Utah highway 75 exit instead. This is a good place to wait for a long distance ride to the Grand Canyon or [[Las Vegas]] area.\\n\\nAnother temptation is to take bus 821 to a Walmart just south of Payson alongside I-15. Although there is a nice spot to camp on the West side of Walmart (secluded), I spent four hours trying to catch a ride. The one I finally got took me up exactly 1 (one) exit and dropped me off on Main Street in Santaquin (3 miles down the road) where I spent 2 days trying to hitch out. Again, there\\'s a nice secluded place to camp near the onramp, but not worth the time it took to get a ride. Stick with the aforementioned Flying J posted by last contributer - Jsplts\\n\\n=== North towards [[Ogden]], [[Logan]] ===\\nHitching north out of SLC can be tricky. You can take the bus to 600 N and walk over the bridge to I-15 and thumb at the on ramp, but there are a lot of police that tell you to leave. You could also try to thumb HWY 89 at 600 N, which does work because most people are getting on I-15 a mile up. I usually just take the bus because it\\'s faster than waiting and fairly cheap. If you\\'re heading all the way to Logan, you can take the 455 to the 630 buses until you get to Brigham. Hitching from 1100 S / HWY 89 in Brigham to Logan through Sardine Canyon is fairly straightforward and easy.\\n\\n== Resources ==\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n{{IsIn|Utah}}\\n\\n[[Category:United States]]\\n[[Category:Utah]]',\n",

It's possible that you wait for an hour, and only 4-5 cars passed by. They also could go in three different directions (last ramp before motorway junction), so your chance of getting picked up by someone going your direction here is quite low.

Once out of the ring road around the historic centre most routes run along Avenida Grigotá, which is Ruta 7 exiting the city in that direction. If coming from another area of the city, take a micro along the closest of the concentric ring roads and make a transfer there.  Get off at the toll booth (peaje) right after La Guardia (2,50BS/0,30€) and start hitching.\\n\\nIf headed south toward Villamontes, Paraguay, and Argentina, you can take the same micro as above but need to get off at the T-junction with Ruta 9, known as Kilómetro 13 (for self-evident reasons). You could hitch there, but most of the traffic passing you goes no farther than the kilometre of exurban neighbourhood that remains down where you\\'re headed. An even more compelling reason is that not quite two kilometres from the junction is a gas station. If there\\'s no gas and you don\\'t want to wait with a truck you find (or can\\'t find one) there\\'s at least one middling speed bump a ways before the gas station that will help you out.

The bus stop is 100m to the left from the metro station. The bus goes along the motorway 68 and there are three service stations on the way not far from each other, first Petrobras, then COPEC and finally Shell. You can get off at \\'\\'\\'\\'\\'Pasarela Pedro Jorquera\\'\\'\\'\\'\\' which is a first bus stop and it\\'s located just after the motorway junction with Vespucio (Santiago Ring). Petrobras is located 600m from the bus stop but it\\'s better to walk for another 1km and get to COPEC. Even though there\\'s not that many trucks there\\'s much more movement of the cars and getting a lift is very easy.\\n\\nAnother option is to hitch just at the beginning of the motorway near the Pajaritos metro station. Walk out of the intermodal onto the Ruta 68, there is space to pull over right at the exit (where the buses pull out).  Most traffic leaving Santiago this way goes direct to Valparaiso, a reliable and easy hitch!\\n\\n\\n=== South towards Rancagua (Ruta 5)===\\n\\nGo to San Bernardo either by microbus or by hitchhiking. I hitch hiked there but had to wait 1 hour to get to San Bernardo. There you will find a bus station next to the Ruta 5.\\nIt\\'s actually not so good here, you can have more chance hitchhiking from the access ramp a little before (-33.581348,-70.714067). People leaving from the Shell gas station can pick you up.\\n\\n===North, nortwest towards [[La Serena]] (Ruta 5)=== \\n\\nGo to \"Puente Cal Y Canto\" metro station (2nd line) and find Avenida La Paz, follow this street to La Paz Terminal and from there take a bus with the sign \"Panamericana\" (800 pesos, if youre lucky - for free). Take a seat in front and search for a spot you like or ask the driver for \"lugar para hacer dedo\", perhaps he knows. There is for example one on-ramp near big truck station, cars are going about 60 - 70 km/h so its possible to hitchhike\\n\\nAlternative: Use google maps to take public buses until one access ramp that could be suitable (spoiler: none of them really are great). One could be here (-33.321808, -70.719898). From there your main objective is to find someone that can help you reach the Copec gas station further ahead (-33.2156679, -70.7675877). Then from this Copec it\\'s really easy to hitch a ride.\\n\\n===North, northeast towards [[Los Andes]], [[San Felipe]] and [[Mendoza]] [[Argentina|(AR)]] (Ruta 57)===\\n\\nUsing google maps and city buses you can arrive close (20min walk?) to this Copec gas station (-33.314618, -70.7042316). People on the road can\\'t really stop easily but people exiting the Copec can give you a lift. You also have a tollbooth a few hundred meters further but as written here, there\\'s no space to stop.\\nThen your main objective is to reach the toll booth of Chacabuco (-33.000787, -70.687244) where trucks going to Argentina could easily stop. Going to Los Andes would be a detour for you (you would have to walk for one hour before reaching a good place).\\nBEWARE: Look at the weather before as in automn/winter the border can close for a few days if there\\'s snow!! The truck drivers will keep driving there and will wait for it to open but none of them will give you a lift.\\n\\nLínea 3 of the Santiago Metro opened in January of 2019, its northern terminus Los Libertadores being just west of where Avenida Independencia becomes Ruta 57, which heads north to Los Andes and the border. It had previously been recommended that hitchers bus to this point to hitch here. \\n\\nEven then, that was not the best option, as the interchange of the peripheral ring road Ruta 70 and Avenida Independencia/Ruta 57 is busy and complicated, with traffic moving fast and there being few spots for it to stop. The arrangement of the interchange from Ruta 70 to Ruta 57 is such that there is no spot to stand where that traffic will pass you. Ruta 57 begins there as limited access, with traffic from Ruta 70 entering in two lanes to the left of lanes entering north from Avenida Independencia and west from the parallel access road of Ruta 70 and nearby neighbourhoods. That traffic is much lighter than the traffic entering from Ruta 57, but if you do feel called to hitch at this point there is a small, wanting spot where Calle Real Audiencia and the very end of Avenida Independencia intersect, a small strip of striped pavement giving space for a car to stop. \\n\\nThe better option is to get a bus going to the northern exurb of Colina. They previously left from the northern terminus of the Metro\\'s Línea 2, Vespucio Norte Station; this may no longer be the case with Línea 3 opening and Los Libertadores Station being better located as a hub for such departures [please confirm!]. You could also previously flag down some buses at the junction of Independencia and Ruta 57 noted above. On the way to Colina the bus will pass a COPEC gas station to your left (it sprouts up between the north- and southbound lanes) and then a couple of hundred meters ahead of that a tollbooth (Peaje Las Canteras). \\n\\nNeither is ideal: there is nowhere to pull over at the tollbooth (as of November 2018 the Googlemaps Streetview appearing to show such a space is out of date) while the traffic at the COPEC is relatively light, the station sees limited numbers of truck stopping, and the traffic on Ruta 57 itself is flying past and the further lane will have difficulty getting to you standing at the station. That said, you will get a ride at either before long. Bus fare to Colina is approximately 1000 pesos (November 2018), but explain where you\\'re going and you may well get taken for free.\\n\\nIf from there you\\'re offered a ride to San Felipe or Los Andes, beware! Neither are particularly good spots to be when heading to Mendoza. From San Felipe you\\'ll need to pass through Los Andes, which spreads out over a wide area, and both are some distance west of the customs facility for trucks going to Argentina. The split in the highway to the south of Los Andes, where it heads northwest to San Felipe and northeast to the customs facility and Mendoza, is isolated and with fast-moving traffic. Instead, ask to be dropped at the next tollbooth (Peaje Chacabuco on Googlemaps, though locals I rode with had another name for it). It\\'s about 10km south of where Ruta 57 splits south of Los Andes, away from any local Santiago traffic and with ample space for cars to pull over; a much better spot than Peaje Las Canteras or the COPEC station.\\n\\n==Public transport==\\n\\nIt\\'s a good idea to buy a Bip! card especially if you want to stay in the city for a few days. You don\\'t need it to use the metro but there\\'s no way to move around by buses without the card. You can buy it for example at the metro stations and it costs only 1350 pesos. The minimum top-up is 1000. Of course it works also with metro.

There is a bus stop here where you can stop a car, and as it is just after a stoplight cars will not be going very fast. Because of the large amount of suburban traffic, using a sign is recommended.\\n\\n'''Option 2'''\\n\\nTake the tram to Ilidža and go until the last stop. From there every 30-50 min you can take a bus to Hadžići direction. Then everything depends from your hitchhiking passion and the bus routes You can leave your bus at Hadžići and hitchhike along M17/E73 towards A1 and then towards Mostar. Otherwise if bus is going to Tarčin, you can go by bus as much as you can, pass Tarčin and leave the bus on the road near Donja Raselica. So you will meet no suburban Sarajevo traffic. There will be the way to Mostar.\\n\\n\\n=== East towards [[Serbia]] {{E|761}} ===\\n\\nTo go east take the tram to Baščaršija and you will see the road which seems to go into the hills along the river.

Hitch at the traffic light or from the petrol station 50\\xa0m further down the road. \\n\\nGo in the direction Trnovo and Foća, avoid Goražde because there is not much traffic there. At border with Montenegro on Hum crossing there are not many cars, but you can catch ride there and road to border is very bad, full of holes. \\n\\n'''Option 2'''\\n\\nIf you want to go direction Trnovo and Foća from Bačaršija you can take the tram #3, #4 or #6 (you can take this tram illegaly for free) towards the southern outskirts of the town Ilidza, and you go out in Stup. Climb to the big road crossing the avenue and you follow it to the right (M18 direction Foća, South). After few meters the road has only one lane in each direction.

The ticket for tram is valid on buses too. You'll be heading out of the inner zone, so you'll need a ticket for the Gesamtnetz. Get out at ''Raben Steinfeld'', and walk up the hill.

Then you\\'re already at the end of the city. Try to wave your thumb there. If you are too lazy to walk to the end of town, you can also give it a try directly at the train station.

Most traffic headed on the A30 west from Schüttorf will actually use the \\'\\'Bad Bentheim\\'\\' ramp (3) and not the Schüttorf one (4). If someone is not going to Oldenzaal or further, they could at least drop you off at the ramp there.\\n\\n== Walking Out ==\\n=== West towards [[Bad Bentheim]] ===\\nHitching from here to Bad Bentheim might be faster, but still, it\\'s only 4 kilometres which can be walked in 45 minutes from Annaheim to Bentheimer Hof. \\'\\'\\'Hitching Schüttorf to Bad Bentheim should only be considered when you\\'re short in time or when the weather is nasty, or if you\\'re a local and are well familiar with what the area has to offer the eye.\\'\\'\\' If you\\'re passing through, and have enough time, you should really consider spending an hour or two here. From Schüttorf railway station, go to Annaheim (old sanatorium, now used as a care home) and enter the forest there. Just follow the path, go straight ahead and it\\'ll lead you right into the kurort. walk around here, and take the surfaced path right. \\nAlso, it\\'s possible to take a left after \"Am Waldbauern\" (just over halfway from Annaheim) and cross the railway track and road.

It's a place one can possibly get to the [[Faeroe Islands]] from. \\n\\n== Crossing to the Faeroe Islands ==\\n\\n[[User:Zenit|Zenit]] heard a story of an unknown hitchhiker getting a ride and decided to go and investigate. Indeed there are fishing boats from the Faeroe Islands calling here most week-ends (but not all), usually on Saturday or Sunday, leaving the following day. If they're in, the sailors will most probably be shopping in Thurso as many things like alcohol are cheaper in Scotland than on the islands, in the fish market or in the Pub (''The Upper Deck''). There also is a cargo boat called ''The Silver Fjord'', or something along those lines, leaving every Tuesday (?) with limited passenger facilities. You'll be required to pay for a crossing, however. More information about this service can be found at the harbour services. To find out about boats that are in the port or expected to call in the next days, go to (or contact - their number's 01847 892779) the harbour office, three houses from the bar. The staff there are very friendly and helpful.\\n\\n[[User:Uncle sam01|Uncle_sam01]] visited Scrabster in August 2016 in hopes of finding a boat to the Faroe Islands. There are both freight and fishing boats, however both boats' agents in Scrabster said that they have been asked to take hitchhikers in the past and that they always decline due to insurance. I gave up after both agents said basically the same thing. However, it's ultimately the captain's decision whether or not they wish to take extra people - if you have the patience to wait for the ships (no one knows when they arrive), then you could try talking to the captain directly, although it's very unlikely you'll get a ride.\\n\\n== Sleeping ==\\n\\nScrabster is very small, but it's a harbour place and as such it's got numerous places where you can spend a dry night. If you have the budget for it, you can of course get a room at the inn, but for us others, there's also empty trailers you can sleep in, on or under depending on your preferences. Just be a bit sneaky and discreet about it. If you have a tent you could also camp near a trail above the lighthouse - it's quite a spot.\\n\\n__NOTOC__\\n{{IsIn|Highlands}}\\n\\n[[Category:Scotland]]\\n[[Category:Highland Council]]\",\n",

Take the subway/metro line number 3 to Yangjae (342) station (take care to avoid the dark red line, or the whole thing loses its economic sense!) and leave on exit number 7.

Leave the roundabout behind and you\\'ll the a green petrol station.\\nHave a look at the Google Map: [http://maps.google.es/maps?saddr=37.380531,-6.04557&daddr=37.38561,-6.046565&hl=es&ll=37.382332,-6.044884&spn=0.00948,0.021136&sll=37.385704,-6.045817&sspn=0.001185,0.002642&geocode=FbNhOgIdfsCj_w%3BFYp1OgIdm7yj_w&mra=ls&t=m&z=16 from the bus stop to the petrol station] \\nAsk for a ride to the next petrol station on the motorway which is 20km far.\\nWukk hitched a ride after 10 minutes to the next petrol station. From there you get a lot of traffic directly to Portugal.--\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 4\\'\\'\\'\\nGo to Santa Justa train station and take Cercanias C-5 (Virgen del Rocio - Benacazon), in direction \"Benacazon\". There is a train each hour for 3,30€. Buy the ticket from Santa Justa to Benacazon. Try to get a ride at the very train station, just ask to reach the town (\"¿Me puede llevar a l pueblo?\" in spanish) or \"Las nieves\" petrol station (\"Me puede llevar a la gasolinera de las nieves\"). If you are unlucky, just walk across the road to the village (the one with a bike lane at the right side, and there ask for the motorway or \"Andalusí Park\" hotel (\"Por donde se va a la autovia\" / \"Por donde se va al hotel Andalusí Park\"). Leave the hotel at your right, walk across the bridge over the motorway and you will see the petrol station. From there you can get a long ride, since the station is far away enough from Sevilla. It has a lot of activity, specialy in summer time. But if everything goes bad, just ask for a ride to the next petrol station in Chucena, a big one with restaurant, lot of services, and many cars and trucks for you to try.\\n\\n=== North towards Extremadura ([[Merida]], Badajoz, etc.) & Castilla y León ===\\n\\nOption 1\\n\\nGo to the Estacion de Autobuses Plaza de Armas (main station) and take the line bus 41 (confirmed) towards Camas and Santiponce.  The ticket costs 1\\'55€ (c. 2016).  Ask the bus driver for la \"ultimata parada\" (last stop) in Santiponce, from which it\\'s a short (15 min.) walk to El Camino de Santiago and also an on-ramp for the Highway 803 to Mérida.\\n\\n\\nOption 2 petrol station\\n\\nFollow the directions above. Then follow the Camino santiago trail through the fields after 40minutes you should see petrol station on your left. Pass underneath the highway and you should be there. Takes about an hour to walk. This petrol station serves both the highway and the route nacional and plenty of cars stop here going in all directions.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Madrid]] ===\\n\\nTake a bus to the airport of Sevilla. Get off at the airport stop and walk straight on towards the motorway. At the junction you will see a BP petrol station in your front. It\\'s only a five minute walk, it\\'s safe and you will find a ride for sure!\\n\\n=== South towards [[Cadiz]] ===\\n\\n\\n\\nOption 1\\n\\nAnother option, that works better on my opinion is the bus stop in the end of Avenida de Jerez before it became a motorway. There are plenty of space for cars, bus do not disturb you, because they are very rarely and usually this bus stop is empty. This street is more busy that the Avenida de la Raza, but cars goes not so fast, because before the bus stop is the traffic light. A sign will be very useful because after 200 metres road split into two direction. Better to wait direct car to Jerez or Cadiz or if you go further get out on the petrol station before Jerez (check the map).\\n\\n\\nOption 2\\n\\nTake the bus to \\'\\'Betis Football Stadium\\'\\' (which is in the south of Sevilla, Betis street is in the center). Ask for the direction of the autopista. At the end of the \\'\\'Avenida de la Raza\\'\\' is a roundabout. Underpass the motorway to the second roundabout and try to get a ride. You can go via the motorway or the parallel road, which also works, since a lot of people want to avoid the motorway toll. But it\\'s slow of course. A sign might be useful.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Granada]] and [[Málaga|Malaga]] ===\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1:\\'\\'\\' Take the bus no.29 from \"El Prado\" bus station (close to the Plaza de Espana) and get off after about 20minutes when you see CEPSA petrol station just few meters from the bus stop. From there try to get a ride to any petrol station further out of the city and on the A92 highway and there to get a longer ride, to [[Málaga|Malaga]], Granada or any other destination on East.\\nin this place, people.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2:\\'\\'\\' Catch the number 29 bus from the city centre to a bus stop appropriately called \"Aux. Autovia Málaga (Drago)\" in eastern Seville. Cross the footbridge and walk along the A92 highway for about 10 minutes until you reach a BP petrol station. There isn\\'t always a footpath on the highway but you can walk one black away from it and rejoin very easily.\\n\\nThis BP petrol station is a popular refueling stop for people driving through Seville and is also strategically located near the on-ramp to the highway. You shouldn\\'t have to wait too long.\\n\\n=== Towards [[Cordoba]] ===\\nFrom the center, walk to Avenida de Kansas City (After RENFE San Justo train station) and on towards the Autovia del Sur. There will be a Carrefour on your right along with a petrol station. If you continue on there will be another petrol station - CEPSA - that you can stand in front of or wait at to ask for rides. The area is surrounded by trees which make it possible to camp and water is available if you ask inside the petrol station. Bring cardboard though as you might have to stay the night.\\n\\nThere is also a bus stop on the road between those two petrol stations, with some place for cars to stop after.\\n\\n== Safety ==\\n\\nWatch out at [[Petrol station hitchhiking|service stations]] in and around Sevilla area for muggers as Sevilla has a history of thefts of truck drivers and other people who stop by. Never leave your stuff alone.\\n\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|Andalusia}}\\n__NOTOC__\\n\\n[[Category:Andalusia]]\\n[[Category:Spain]]\\n[[Category:Andalusia]]\\n[[Category:E5]]\\n\\n[[es:Sevilla]]',\n",

There are 2 petrol stations close to the A1, a Petrol and further down the road a Mol (was closed on Sept 15th 2017). Between the two stations there is enough space next to the road to catch a ride in direction of Braşov or Bucureşti.

It\\'s not a very good spot, but hitchhiking west from Sibiu can be difficult. \\n\\nSince the highway A1 was built people don\\'t seem to use the other road passing the airport, so despite being counterintuitive people will enter the highway (E81) at the eastern part of the city, which later becomes A1 even when they go west. Trust me, don\\'t try to hitchhike from the other spots. \\n\\nIf people are heading north to Cluj Napoca or Alba Lulia ask them to leave you at the first roundabout after they exit A1.

There should be a small church on your left side, right before the intersection. Right after this intersection, the main road widens for a bit, becoming a 4-lane, and that's where you'll need to be, just after the main road turns right, on that extra lane. Don't worry about traffic, as cars coming of the 2-lane road still use the 4-lane one as a 2-lane for a while, so it's completely safe.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Braşov]], [[Bucureşti|Bucharest]] ===\\nTowards Brașov, there are many hitchhiking places along the E60 road. One of them is in front of the big commercial building (known in the past as Sigma), crossing the river from the white Orthodox cathedral. \\n\\nThere is another place, after the traffic light, near the bus station, in front of a sport/fishing/bike shop. You can protect your bags/and yourself from rain by storing them in front of the shop. From this place you can also take a mini-bus, stopping from 6am at each 2 hour (it has a loose schedule).\\n\\n=== West towards [[Mediaş]], [[Sibiu]] ===\\n\\nFor hitching to Mediaș or Sibiu you can use the same place as for Târgu Mureș (going North).

Located on the A44 45\\xa0km east of Dortmund, you are likely to pass here on your way to or from Benelux.\\n\\n== Hitching in ==\\n\\nIf you come from the motorway, ask the driver to drop you off at the Soest-Ost exit. Here there is a Burger King restaurant that is quite popular among young people of the town. From the parking area it will be easy to find a lift to the city centre. The town itself is small and everything can be discovered by walking, but the motorway is some kilometres outside the town.\\n\\n== Hitching out ==\\n\\n=== West towards [[Dortmund]], east or south towards [[Kassel]], [[Munich]], [[Dresden]] {{Autobahn|44}} ===   \\n\\nFrom the train station or the center you should take bus R51 to Warstein. Get off in the village \"Muellingsen\" and turn right from the road to the village itself. Turn right again to \"Kirchweg\" and walk through this path till the gas station Soester Boerde on the A44. To go East this is the first turn, to go West you have to pass through the bridge and turn then. Traffic here is huge and finding a lift very easy. If you want to go further West make sure the driver is not going to the center of the big cities on the way (f.e. Dortmund, Bochum or Essen) as there are no bigger gas stations and you can get stuck easy. Waiting for a lift direct to the Netherlands can be convenient.\\n\\nTicket for the bus R51 (once every hour, from around 6AM til 10PM) will be 1,60 Euro (as of August 2012) and as the drivers are checking mostly very carefull when you enter the bus, blackriding will be a hard challange. You can also walk from the city along Grandweg, Niederbergheimer Straße, right into Waldstraße, left into Detmolder Straße, around 4 km.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Hamm]] ===\\n\\nFrom the train station walk left (you can ask people for the police office, it is this direction) until you see a tunnel on the left side.

You have Metro (shop, mall) on your right, keep walking 1 km, you will reach a traffic light that is perfect to hitch, you might not even wait more than 5 minutes. Perfect stop. Some experiences suggest that it is difficult to get a direct ride to Istanbul from here unless you start as early in the morning as possible when the relevant traffic for Istanbul leaves the city. Also, waiting times can be longer than five minutes. Shorter rides are easier to catch. \\n\\n===== Second option =====\\n\\nTake metro and get to stop called Младост 1 (Mladost 1). Walk north along Yerusalim street until you get to the main road Tsarigradsko Shose. You should see Carrefour shopping centre around. Then take bus number 5 direction Lozen and go with it until it leaves main road on a cloverleaf junction. Get off on the next stop and go back to the junction. You will stand on a motorway junction with directions north, east to [[Plovdiv]] and west to [[Sofia]]. Go down the ramp to direction [[Plovdiv]] and you will see some shops and bars where people stop next to the motorway. Try standing on the hard shoulder to get a lift or ask people there. Nearly all traffic there goes to [[Plovdiv]] or even further east\\n\\n\\n=== West towards [[Serbia]] {{E|80}} ===\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\' Lukoil petrol station\\n\\nTake metro to Slivnitsa and than bus 54 three stops till Magazin Metro 2. Or walk from metro Slivnitsa up E80/8 highway 3.5 km to same bus stop.There is Lukoil fuel station and a bus stop on the highway\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nBus 54 towards Kalotina all the way to the end. It ends on the highway to Belgrade on a very good hitchhiking spot. But bring some cardboard with you from the city center since there aren\\'t any trash cans. \\n\\nThis road enters Serbia at the [[Kalotina-Dimitrovgrad border crossing]].\\n\\nUpdate 2022: It is by far the best to take a bus out to the highway, like the 54, instead of standing in near the city on the nr 8 highway. If you are near the city you may wait hours, if you even get a ride. Not recommended.\\n\\n=== Southwest towards [[Skopje]] ===\\n\\nTake tram number 19 in the direction \\'\\'Knyazhevo\\'\\' all the way to the last stop. You will recognize the last stop because it turns off the road to make a tight loop and doubles back on its route. As you hop off the tram, come back on the main road and keep walking the direction of tram \\n\\nTo get out of city you need to walk 2 km till Lukoil fuel station\\n\\nOr After getting out of tram  catch bus number 59 after about 8 minutes on the bus get out at Ul. Mala Koriya bus stop and look for Lukoil fuel station\\n\\n\\n=== North towards [[Veliko Tarnovo]], [[Bucureşti|Bucharest]], [[Varna]] ===\\n\\nTake tram 22 in direction east, get off at the last stop.  The road parallel to the tramline runs directly out of the city, its possible to hitch anywhere from here but I would suggest a better place after the ring road which isolates only the traffic running to the A2 motorway. 7 km up the road is a Shell petrol station, the last stop for gas before the motorway, you can either walk the 7 km straight up the road or if you look to the left you will see a carpark in front of a car dealership.  This is the bus station, take either the 117, 90 or 12, all will run directly up the road and stop more or less in front of the Shell petrol station. You can choose either the petrol station or just up the road is also ideal for hitching. An even better option is to take the 90 and persist with it until you reach the end of a road village called Gorni Bogrov (Bulgarian: Горни Богров), where you can hitch-hike from the bus station directly with great success since it has a lot of room for stopping and cars drive slow.\\n\\n\\n=== South towards [[Blagoevgrad]], [[Thessaloniki]] ===\\n\\nTake tram 5 to the last stop - the tram originates behind the court building (Съдебна палата) in the center of Sofia. Walk another 5-10 minutes in the same direction of the tram until it is clear you are out of that neighborhood where all the traffic is heading out of the city. A good place to stop is at or just after the last stop light so the drivers are already stopped and have time to see you. Or don\\'t mess with the walking, take the bus #58 and go till it leaves the road for the village of Vladaya/Владая. If you are lucky a trucker will pick you up going all the way to Thessaloniki and on to Italy, otherwise the first 20 km are tricky (lot or cars going short distances) but after you pass Pernik you\\'ll get a ride all the way to Blagoevgrad in no time.\\n\\n\\n== Hitching In ==\\n\\n\\n=== West from [[Plovdiv]], [[Edirne]] and [[Istanbul]] ===\\n\\nIf you\\'re in a car continuing in the direction of Belgrade you can get off where they turn right, where it says something like \"transit Belgrado\".  If you walk a bit further you will find a bus stop for bus #5.\\n\\n\\n== Transport between north and south ==\\n\\nIf you just want to get through the city as hitching from the direction of the Serbian Niš to Greece to the south or opposite there\\'s a quite useful bus to take. The number is 111 and goes around the ring on the west outskirts of the city. On the north, the end stop is just around some DIY shopping center, need to cross these to get to the ring. On the south the end is not the road to Greece, so be aware to get off in time.\\n\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{{hitchbase_city|205}}\\n__NOTOC__\\n\\n[[Category:Bulgaria]]\\n[[Category:Route to Istanbul]]\\n[[Category:E80]]\\n[[Category:E83]]\\n[[Category:E79]]\\n\\n[[bg:София]]\\n[[de:Sofia]]\\n{{IsIn| Bulgaria}}',\n",

The name of the city is often abbreviated to \"So\\'ton\" or \"Soton\".\\n\\nSouthampton is the closest city to the New Forest national park, and also a major port. Apart from freight ships and cruise liners the only ferries that depart from the city are [http://www.hytheferry.co.uk/ Southampton - Hythe] and [[Isle of Wight]] services (vehicular to East Cowes and a passenger-only hi-speed ferry to West Cowes - both operated by [http://www.redfunnel.co.uk/ RedFunnel]).\\n\\nThe ferries for [[France]] depart from [[Portsmouth]] and [[Poole]].\\n\\n[[Rownhams Services]] are quite close to the city - if you can get a lift there, you\\'ll be in London in no time and should also be able to get towards the East.\\n\\n== Hitching Out of City Centre ==\\n\\n=== North or East via {{Mgb|27}} ===\\n* Option 1\\n\\nFollow signs for A335 (St Mary\\'s Rd - Onslow Rd - Bevois Valley Rd) - it soon goes into Thomas Lewis Way aka \"Portswood and Swaythling Bypass\" - if you fail to get a lift from its start, you can walk towards the North - there is a Shell Petrol Station in Swaythling a 1.5 miles to the North. Please note that Thomas Lewis Way is not the safest road to walk - there is no pavement, and no-stopping restrictions are in operation. However, [[User:Lnx|Lnx]] managed to get a lift in about 20 minutes while walking (and only trying to obtain a lift at the traffic lights when they were red - the road has many traffic light-regulated junctions which are not far from one another).\\n\\n* Option 2\\n\\nAlternatively, you could try walking along The Avenue/Bassett Avenue (A33) - although it has bus lanes in places, it\\'s definitely worth giving it a try (especially in Southampton Common area, where there is one very wide lane each way.

A bold and happy sign simply for \"Isle of Wight\" did the trick. Got offered a lift within 2 minutes even, but the family decided they didn\\'t have enough room for me (I had a lot of stuff..). When we went to check in, the lady at the office asked how many passengers we were, but I guess simply for legal reasons to know how many people are on the ship (she didn\\'t need to take information of the extra passenger or anything).\\n\\n== Hitching Out from the Outskirts ==\\n\\n=== North towards Eastleigh, [[Winchester]], ([[West Midlands|The West Midlands]], A34), [[London]] ===\\nIf you are in the north of the city, try hitching from near Chilworth roundabout, where the {{Mgb|3}} starts.

Traffic jams are frequent here, slowing down traffic enough to get a ride faster.\\n\\n'''Option 2'''\\n\\nAnother option is to get to ''Ploshad' Pobedy'' (Площадь Победы). The nearest metro station is Moskovskaya. It's the beginning of the road to Moscow (Moskovskoye Shosse), pretty easy to catch direct rides to the capital here. There's a bus stop just after the roundabout, at the beginning of the road. You can hitchhike there or go a bit past the bus stop. A sign saying Moscow might be useful.\\n\\n\\n=== Southwest towards [[Tallinn]] ===\\n\\nTake the Metro to the station of Prospekt Veteranov (Проспект Ветеранов), Go out of the station and walk on the street carrying the same name towards west, when you get to Prospekt Marshala Zhukova street (Проспект Маршала Жукова) cross the road and turn left. There's a bus stop and a lot of space for cars to pull over, and there's traffic jams very often, so you shouldn't wait too long. This road will take you to the M-11, going all the way to the Estonian border. If walking is too long for you (3.7 km), there is a bus nr 130 going there and also a trolleybus nr 37. the name of the stop where you have to get off is Prospekt Marshala Zhukova (Проспект Маршала Жукова).\\n\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|Russia}}\\n\\n[[ru:Санкт-Петербург]]\",\n",

Here\\'s also a good spot in the direction of Zwolle, Both on-ramps are about equally frequented, and your choice will pretty much depend on your location in the city.\\n\\nThe on-ramp towards Leeuwarden at Steenwijk-Zuid is a bit harder to access because the road leading there is prohibited for pedestrians, but is also a good spot if you got dropped off here and don\\'t want to walk through the whole city to the other on-ramp.\\n\\n== Hitching in ==\\n{{Coords|52.7750|6.1685}}<br>\\nIf you\\'re dropped off at exit 5 (Zuid), walk to the roundabout west of the motorway.

In general it\\'s pretty easy to get a ride into the city.\\n\\n== Wild camping ==\\n\\nLuckily enough there are some great places for wild camping close to the motorway. If you\\'re at exit 6, walk along the \\'\\'Onderduikersweg\\'\\', an unpaved road parallel to the motorway, until it makes a sharp right turn. About 50m after that there\\'s a trail leading left into the forest.

This may be the case with other parts of France. \\n\\n== Getting around ==\\n<map lat=\\'48.55388717497782\\' lng=\\'7.7474212646484375\\' zoom=\\'11\\' view=\\'0\\' float=\\'right\\' height=\\'400\\'/>\\nPublic transport is very cheap for a western European city. A 24 hour pass costs EUR 4.30, for EUR 6.40 you get a 24 hour pass for 3 persons (August 2015). See [https://www.cts-strasbourg.eu/en/online-store/fares/tickets/ fares].\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== Going east ([[Germany]]) {{Autobahn|5}} ===\\nThe German town of [[Kehl]] (just over the border to the East) is a good place to pick up traffic to the A5 (all directions), especially from the petrol station at the entrance to the B28 ([http://hitchwiki.org/maps/?place=7333]). \\n\\nWalking (from Strasbourg centre) to Kehl takes about 50 minutes if you go the shortest route (check Google maps!). Strasbourg tram reaches Kehl center since 2018, the price is the same as within Strasbourg, 2€\\n\\nAlternatively, you can take the regional train (around 6 minutes for about EUR 3) or the tram (line D, 20 minutes, 1.80€).\\n\\nBy train, for 2 euro more, you can continue after [[Kehl]] till Appenweier. From there you can walk or hitchhike to the petrol station \"Rasthof [[Renchtal]]\" (2,5 km check the route on maps.google.com or see [[Renchtal]] for details ). It can be a good alternative to Kehl because in 30 minutes more, you\\'re on the German motorway network.\\n\\n=== Going North ([[Metz]], [[Saarbrücken]]) {{Afr|4}} and South ([[Mulhouse]], [[Switzerland]]) {{Afr|35}} ===\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\' Shell and Total fuel stations on A35 highway \\n\\nTake the tram (red line A) to Parc Malraux and then the bus  13 direction Lingolsheim gare and get out at Ostwald Eglise. From the bus stop walk up to the entrance of the church (\"Église\" is French for \"church\") nearby. Facing the entrance just walk down Rue de l\\'Église parallel left to the church. Keep on walking until you reach Rue D\\'Illkirch which leads to the bridge over the motorway (see [https://goo.gl/maps/Me0pt directions]). If you want to go south, don\\'t cross the bridge: There is a steep path down to the petrol station. If you want to go north cross the bridge and access the other petrol station.\\n\\nHeading south you might want to avoid the steep path which leads to the petrol station. Facing the entrance of the church you can also walk to the left, down Rue de Lorraine. At the end of  Rue de Lorraine turn right and follow the street until you reach the A35 motorway (see [https://goo.gl/maps/xcuvr directions]). There is a direct entrance to the service station for traffic going south towards Mulhouse and Switzerland. \\nUpdate: https://hitchwiki.org/en/User:Whisperingofthestars tried this spot (south) in November 2023. Oddly enough, it was mostly foreigners coming into the petrol station, and little of them at that. Seems like the petrol station was giving out very little petrol (for whatever reason). It took forever to get out. {Pay attention also when you get a ride south, between approaching Mulhouse and south (and also coming back north) there\\'s no petrol stations. Jass thinks there was one on the way between Strasbourg and Mulhouse. Mulhouse is also quite out of the way if you\\'re heading to Basel. \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nToward Mulhouse via the D1083. Take the bus 62 (at the end of the A tram line Graffenstaden) and stop at . There you can walk up north for 3/5 minutes, on the D1083, toward a Total  gas station! Eventually the road joins the N83, and the A35.\\nNote- there\\'s little reason why people would take the national to go direct to Mulhouse as the motorway is free on this section until Basel.\\n\\n=== Going North ([[Metz]], [[Saarbrücken]], [[Paris]]) ===\\nTake a regional train direction \\'\\'Brumath/Mommenheim\\'\\' and make sure it stops at \\'\\'Stephansfeld\\'\\'. From there you can walk within 15 min to the petrol station \\'\\'Air de Service Brumath\\'\\' on the A4 and start hitchhiking straight at the petrol station.\\nThe trainticket from Strasbourg to Stephansfeld costs EUR 3.90 (2016). You may have to jump a fence to enter the actual petrol station, but it is not too tall and in June 2016 there was a convenient hole in it. \\n\\nAlternatively, just walk (10 minutes from the centre) to Place de Haguenau, and walk to the entrance of the A4 (there is a cycle path that leads right next to it if you don\\'t like contending with the cars). There is a lot of space for people to stop and it is the best way to head north from the centre. Mind you, do NOT hitchhike at the Place de Haguenau as there is absolutely no shoulder to pull over.\\n\\n=== Going west ===\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\' \\n\\nJoin the A4 by the Going north route see above. Good solution for Paris.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Optioon 2\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nJoin the N4 take the \"bus interurbain\" [http://www.cts-strasbourg.fr/Portals/0/PDF/horaires/interurbains/hiver/205.pdf #205],[http://www.cts-strasbourg.fr/Portals/0/PDF/horaires/interurbains/hiver/206.pdf #206 or #207] from \"Ancienne synagogue-Les Halles\" or \"Gare Centrale\" to Ittenheim (eur 1.80). From Ittenheim\\'s bus stop, walk till the entry of the village (3 minutes), and you\\'re on the best spot of the N4 to leave Strasbourg. This road has the advantage to be free of fees so many cool people use it. I recommend it to go to Metz and Nancy cause you don\\'t loose a lot of time compared to motorways and you have many more chances to get a lift.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n{{Cities France}}\\n\\n\\n{{hitchbase_city|412}}\\n__NOTOC__\\n\\n[[Category:France]]\\n[[Category:E25]]\\n[[Category:E52]]\\n\\n[[de:Strasbourg]]\\n[[fr:Strasbourg]]',\n",

There is a little green area and after that a departure for a car park or something like this. With a good sign you get lots of the traffic out of Stuttgart heading towards the motorway and they can stop quite easily. Took me one hour at a Friday to get a straight ride to Würzburg.\\n\\n==== Possibility 2 ====\\n\\nFrom Hauptbahnhof (Central Station) take Metro 15/7 to \"Borsigstraße\". When you leave the train, there is one petrol station in front of you (direction of the train) . Most of the cars that stop there go on the motorway (\"Autobahn\") [[A81 (Germany)|A81]]\\n\\nWhen you are on motorway (Autobahn) A 81 you can jump off on the resting place called \"Wunnenstein\" that has also a petrol station and is between Stuttgart and Heilbronn or rather the departure to motorway (Autobahn) A 6. From there you can get rides to the north or west. But there I sometimes had to wait longer (about 45 minutes in average) to get a ride to the north because a lot of cars are going to the west.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Munich|München]], [[Ulm]] {{Autobahn|8}} ===\\n\\n==== Löffelstraße ====\\n\\n[[File:From_Stuttgart_to_Munchen.png|thumb|250px|right|Hitchhiking spot \\'\\'Löffelstraße\\'\\']]\\n\\'\\'\\'\\'\\'Löffelstraße/Stuttgart-Degerloch (B27 that leads to A8 [[Munich|München]]-[[Karlsruhe]])\\'\\'\\'\\'\\' – From Hauptbahnhof (Main Station), you can take the metro U5 (Leinfelden), U6 (Fasanenhof), or U12 (Möhringen/Vaihingen) and exit at the stop \\'\\'Degerloch\\'\\'.

You can not get to Munchen from anywhere on highway 7 because everyone is going in a different direction. If you are stuck there you will need to ask a driver to just move you on  to some other place from where you can catch ride to highway 8.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Singen]] {{Autobahn|81}} and West towards [[Karlsruhe]] {{Autobahn|8}} ===\\n\\'\\'It is perhaps best to check the hitch map also as there have been numerous stories of these points being hard to leave.\\'\\'\\n\\'\\'There is only one rest station between Stuttgart and Karlsruhe.

This is not the best place, as it is illegal for cars to stop there (nonetheless, it is likely that they will, because they cannot go very fast here). Also, you may attract attention from the police, as it is also illegal to stand there.\\n\\nThis one is a good spot to go south and west, but it might also work to get a ride east towards [[Munich|München]].

It is connected to a multi-story car park. The car park is just a couple of hundred meters away from the motorway entry. A lot of people are using the car park and take the S-Bahn into the city centre to avoid the traffic. Especially if the local football/soccer team is playing or if there is a similar event in town you should easily get a lift asking the people driving out of the car park. Obviously there are a lot more people leaving the car park in the evening but you should get a lift during the daytime as well. \\n\\nJust outside the car park is a roundabout so you can try to get there a lift too. \\n\\nOr you turn right at the exit of the car park. 100 meters down the road are some traffic lights. All the cars on the left lane are driving directly onto the motorway. You can easily ask them if you can get a lift or use a sign.\\n\\n==== Stuttgart-Denkendorf ====\\n\\nAbout 15 km south-east of Stuttgart on the A8 there is the service station \\'\\'Denkendorf\\'\\'. Lots of cars are passing by here coming from the direction of Munich, lots of them going to Stuttgart but many also going further on the A8 or A81. The station can be reached by taking the U7 metro to Nellingen Ostfildern (which is the last stop), and from there bus 119 to Denkendorf. Leave the bus at Rathaus. The journey takes about 50 minutes from Stuttgart central station, costs eur 3.60 and normally there is a connection at least every 20 minutes. If it is more practical for you, bus 119 also departs from Essingen Hbf.\\n\\nFrom Rathaus bus stop, go back 20 meters, then take a half left turn into Kirchstraße, follow it for about 1 km. Then again a half left turn into Friedhofstraße, follow it out of the village along the cemetery. Take the second to the left (still Friedhofstraße), follow it up the hill (keeping to the left), and after a small hill you will reach the service station. To avoid frustration when asking the drivers, note that cars whose German number plate starts with the single letter S are registered in Stuttgart and will probably end their journey there\\n\\n=== South towards [[Konstanz]] {{Autobahn|81}} ===\\n\\nWhen you cross Stuttgart than it is not so easy to go down to Konstanz with high way 81. You have every 20 or 30 km petrol stations with a lack of traffic.  A lot of people are going to small places and they will go out from high way so you ask them and check if there is any petrol station before they went in their direction. On petrol stations you must go and ask drivers because you will not have so much opportunity to catch ride. When you get closer to Konstanz, maybe 50 km before a lot of drivers will go to Switzerland but you can try from there back to Konstanz. If the dark falls than it will be more difficult because traffic more reduce, so just be prepared.\\n\\nTake S1 direction Herrenberg and drop of at Nurfringen. When leaving the Train, go direction Wiesengrund and from there go through the forest to the Schönbuch petrol station. Baam! You are at A81 direction South!

It is located in the Eastern Group of the islands together with [[Santa Maria]]. The government of the Azores is also located on São Miguel, in its biggest and most important city [[Ponta Delgada]]. About 45,000 of São Miguel\\'s 140,000 inhabitants live there. São Miguel is also the Azorean island most frequented by foreign tourists with direct flights to several different locations in [[Europe]] and [[North America]].\\n\\n== Hitchhiking ==\\nHitchhiking is quite easy and works well on São Miguel. Although some public buses exist, they often don\\'t go when and where you want, so many people will accept you as a hitchhiker without long explanations. As a signal the thumb works perfectly, there is no need for a written sign. Many people will drive you straight to your destination, show you around or at least make a detour. As many people on the island live from tourism, you might find people picking you up only to practice their English. Also, you are more likely to get picked up by foreign tourists with rented cars. And finally, you will get lifts on the back of pick-up trucks as well.\\n\\n== How to get there ==\\nThe only way to get to São Miguel for free is probably by [[Hitchhiking a sailboat|hitchhiking a sailing boat]], either from Europe, North America or maybe the [[Caribbean]]. There are no ferries from mainland [[Portugal]], and ferries from the other Azorean islands are charged per person. If coming from outside the Azores, then a plane is most likely to be your only choice. Tickets are cheapest from [[Lisbon]]. There is no public transport available at the airport, so hitchhiking or walking is the only way to get out. It\\'s quite a bit to Ponta Delgada\\'s city center.\\n\\nWhen travelling to any of the other islands, see [[Azores#Useful information|useful information]] for tips on saving money when taking a ferry. In summer, ferries are sometimes completely booked out, so buy your ticket ahead at the port in Ponta Delgada.\\n\\n== Useful information ==\\nAs on most of the Azorean islands, there are a few spots marked as \"public swimming pools\" in the Atlantic Ocean on free tourist maps. Go there to have a free shower after swimming. Some are not so nice though (e.g. the one in [[Lagoa]]). Wild [[camping]] seems to be forbidden, but as long as you leave in the morning, you won\\'t have any problems. If you like hiking, get some free maps with hiking trails at tourist information offices.\\n\\n{{Azores Islands}}\\n{{IsIn|Azores}}\\n[[Category:Portugal]]',\n",

It\\'s a big service station and truck stop, perfect to ask around. It has a Shell petrol station.\\nPresidente Dutra is the name of BR-116, the main motorway connecting Rio and São Paulo which passes close to the airport near Guarulhos.\\n\\n* \\'\\'\\'Pedágio Arujá\\'\\'\\'\\nAround four kilometres further up the road from \\'\\'Posto Farol\\'\\' there is a toll plaza in the city of \\'\\'\\'\\'\\'Arujá\\'\\'\\'\\'\\'. You can get closer by bus 384, the same that goes from Metro \\'\\'Armenia\\'\\' to the \\'\\'Posto Farol\\'\\'. The toll plaza has a lay-by to pull over, so some trucks stop there. Hitch further away from the toll booths, if you\\'re too close you\\'ll be sent further away anyways.\\n\\n* \\'\\'\\'CEASA Guarulhos\\'\\'\\'\\nFor something different head to the CEASA (Central de Abastecimento de Alimentos) in Guarulhos. From here its possible to get a truck anywhere in Brazil, the size of the place is overwhelming at first. CEASAs are centres of sale for producers of food. \\n\\n\\'\\'I had to sleep in the Ceasa waiting for the one truck going to the Bolivian border but the truckies looked after us and we had free showers and food\\'\\' - two anonymous hitchiking friends.\\n\\n\\'\\'It is also very possible to hitch on the road (Dutra) near the bus stops.

Most of the time, there is a wide shoulder, and a grassy area where you can stand.

Tell the driver to stop \\'\\'em saida da Biittencourt pra Itapecerica\\'\\'. It should cost you around 7 reais.

The ride with a bus is about 1.5 hours through all the São Paulo, but the bus passes close to the Metro station \\'\\'Cidade Jardim\\'\\', so you can catch it there to save time. Another option to get to the posto is bus 282 also from \\'\\'Tietê\\'\\', but the last one leaves at 18:00. This one passes close to the Metro station \\'\\'Butanta\\'\\' and costs around 8 reais. Régis Bittencourt is the name of BR-116 connecting São Paulo and Curitiba.\\nHere is the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDkcAxUD-No video] made on the place.\\n\\n* \\'\\'\\'Pedágio São Lourenço da Serra\\'\\'\\'\\nFrom Metro station \\'\\'Capão Redondo\\'\\' take either bus 001 or 340 to \\'\\'Itapecerica da Serra\\'\\' and get off at \\'\\'Praça Belchior de Pontes\\'\\' in the town of \\'\\'Itapecerica\\'\\'. From the same praça take bus 030 to \\'\\'Jaquitiba\\'\\' (2.75 reais) and tell the driver that you want to get off at pédagio (toll plaza). Hitch slightly behind the toll booths. Another option to get to the pedágio is bus 282 from \\'\\'Terminal Tietê\\'\\', but the last one leaves at 18:00 and on weekends 16:00.\\n\\n=== Northwest and North towards Interior of São Paulo State, [[Goiania]] and [[Brasília|Brasilia]] ===\\n\\nMake your way to \\'\\'Jundiai\\'\\' by train. From the centre of São Paulo go to Metro station \\'\\'Luz\\'\\' and get the A train. The fare is around R$ 2.80 \\nOnce you get to \\'\\'Jundiai\\'\\' station you will need to walk or get a bus through the city to either one of the Rodovias Anchieta or Bandeirantes. There is a \\'\\'posto de gasolina\\'\\' (petrol station) and truck stop a little north of the city on the Rodovia Anchieta. Lunchtime is a good time to find a \\'\\'caminhoneiro\\'\\' (truck driver). If not there are always truck drivers trying to fix their trucks. Have a map on you so you familiarise yourself with the many cities in the area when asking for lifts.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Belo Horizonte]] (BR-381)===\\nThere is a gas station with a McDonalds on the BR-381, not very far from São Paulo city and reachable by bus. It is not very big, but you can definitely get a lift to the next, larger one.\\nIt is easy to get there with a bus, but it takes a lot of time (a journey of around one hour).\\nBus 1783-10 you can take from the metro L1 Santana station, it departs every 20 minutes. Bus 2023-10 departs from the same metro line L1, but three stations further north, Tucuruvi. Check google maps to be sure where to take the bus, and if the route still exists. Ask the driver for Rodoviaria Fernão Dias, it is the name of the motorway BR-381 going direction Belo Horizonte. The busses bring you very close to the motorway, and then you have 3 minutes walk till the gas station. You will have to cross the motorway over the bridge. \\n\\nThere you can ask drivers. There are very few cars going to Minas Gerais, but a lot of those driving at least till [[Atibaia]]. \\nJust at the very beginning of Atibaia there comes a Petrobras gas station with \"Frango Asado\" restaurant. There is more traffic, and lots of people travelling to Minas Gerais stop for a meal there.\\n\\n\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n[[Category:Brazil]]\\n[[Category:Brazil]]\\n\\n{{IsIn|Brazil}}',\n",

There are two good places to start, both accessible by buses leaving from the central bus station, or from the Arlozerov Terminal (Namir street).\\n\\n\\nTo the Cinema City complex take bus number 501/601/90 (8.7 NIS). This is on the main road, 5 min out of Tel Aviv, and located half a kilometer north of the Gilot junction, where traffic from Jerusalem joins in with Tel Aviv traffic towards the north. Here there is a bus stop, but traffic on the main road is moving too fast to easily stop a car. Try instead hitchhiking a lift with one of the cars leaving the petrol station or shopping mall. Many drivers are only going to the first city on the main road, [[Herzaliya]], but you can eventually get a lift that will take you beyond.\\n\\nYou can also take a bus to the intersection where the main road turns off towards Yakum, 20 min out of Tel Aviv, after Herzalyia.. To get to this Yakum junction take bus 601 (13.5NIS). From here you can hitchhike from near the bus stop, which is a bit off the main road and so you\\'ll be waiting for cars coming from Yakum or the petrol station here.\\n\\nAnother good spot to hitch from Tel Aviv to the North is from right next to the Azrieli shopping mall (HaShalom train station). You\\'ll need to cross the big bridge from Azrieli east (towards Givataim, on HaShalom/Givat HaTahmoshet street), past the train station, and right there turn left to the small ramp leading to Ayalon North. See exact location [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=&daddr=32.073056,34.793985&hl=en&geocode=&mra=mi&mrsp=0&sz=18&sll=32.072934,34.794254&sspn=0.002477,0.003449&ie=UTF8&z=18 here].\\nNotice that if you\\'re going far north, that most of the traffic here is local, so it\\'s best not to take a ride if doesn\\'t take you at least as far as Netanya - otherwise you\\'ll end up in another bad hitching spot in the Tel Aviv area.\\n\\n\\nTo Haifa a direct ride is best, as sometime drivers get off the highway where there is no good hitchhiking spot. However, ask the driver and he may know a petrol station on the main road where he can drop you off. To [[Afula]] and [[Tiberias]] you will need to get a ride which turns right in Ceaseria Junction to Road 65 - If the driver continues till Haifa then you will not be able to get off in that junction.\\n\\n=== To [[Beer Sheva]], the Negev, [[Eilat]], [[Egypt]] and [[Aqaba]] ([[Jordan]]) ===\\n\\nOne possible spot for this is from the Central (\"Merkaz\"/\"Savidor\"/\"Tzafon\") train station, AKA Arlozorov Bus Terminal, there is a small ramp leading to Ayalon Highway South-bound. Most of the traffic is local, and traffic goes from here in 3 main direction: Ayalon South, Road 4 (Ashdod, South) and Road 1 to [[Jerusalem]] direction. On that ramp there is a little used bus stop, and a place for cars to brake. They often do, even if it seems improbable at first. See exact location [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=&daddr=Exits+Ayalon+Darom-%E2%80%AB%D7%90%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9F+%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9D%E2%80%AC%E2%80%8E&geocode=FV6J6QEdZvcSAg&hl=en&mra=ls&sll=32.082236,34.797376&sspn=0.001239,0.001725&ie=UTF8&ll=32.082315,34.797419&spn=0.001239,0.001725&z=19 here].\\n\\nAnother spot is Holtz junction, ten minutres walk from the central bus station - Go to the end of Levinsky street, where the bus station is, and turn south before the bridge over the highway, until you get to a street called Kibbutz Galuyot. Then go left under the bridge. There is a bus stop there that is a good spot for rides south and east in the direction of Jerusalem - if the driver is going all the way to the Jerusalem area, ask them to drop you off at Latroun interchange - under the interchange bridge is a possible (not very good) spot, or walk a little bit south along highway 3 (about 5 minutes), past the monastery, there is a bus station that is a much better spot. \\n\\nOn-ramps to Road 20 (the Ayalon) that are north of LaGuardia (Halacha, Arozolov and HaShalom) are all safe and commonly used for hitchhiking. Standing with a sign is very helpful - \"south\" (דרום) would be the best sign to hold. Be aware of drivers using Road 6 may be exiting in an area where it is difficult to get a ride. Kiryat Gat is the only Road 6 exit with regular on/off traffic. It is not recommended to take a ride to Ashdod, as there is nowhere safe to drop riders who are heading south because the intersection is now an interchange that continues far away from the road south. Another destination to be aware of is Ashkelon or Sderot (Road 4) - you may wait a long time for a ride out and there are often hitching queues on Friday afternoon/evening.\\n\\nHowever, if 14.5NIS (3 Euro) is only a small part of your daily budget and you\\'re not addicted to hitchhiking there is not really a good reason to go hitchhike - as the bus from Tel Aviv to [[Beer Sheva]] is pretty cheap, and from there you can continue south by thumb easily. Other two options for the adventurous from Tel Aviv:\\n\\n# The La Guardia on ramp south. Basically, anyone going South will take you to a better spot. It\\'s not very safe though.\\n# Take bus 475 from Tel Aviv central bus station, and ask the driver for a ticket till \"El-Al junction\" (11.7 NIS). The bus will pass the \"Airport offices\", and the next station is where you should get off. From the bus station you just descended to, it is possible to hitchhike south towards Beer Sheva. You go south on Road 40#, don\\'t take a ride which diverts from this road, and you will get to Beer Sheva. (The last few kms are considered road 406, so don\\'t worry about it). \\n\\nIf you are heading southern towards the Negev, [[Eilat]] or [[Egypt]], then it\\'s recommended to take a bus till \"Goral Junction\", 10 km north of Beer Sheva. Take any bus to [[Beer Sheva]], like line 370 from Arlozerov terminal, and ask the driver to go off in that junction. From there continue your journey on Road 40, and again do not divert from this road. If you don\\'t find there any long-haul rides, ask the drivers to take you do \"Hativat Ha-Negev\" Junction, from which any ride south will be helpful. Road 40 continues approx. 200 km south, till you reach \"Ketura\" junction, where you change to road 90 that goes all the way south to Eilat, the Jordanian border crossing at Aqaba, and the Egyptian border crossing at Taba.\\n\\n=== To [[Jerusalem]] ===\\n\\nGo to the closest Road 20 (Ayalon) junction - preferably Keren Kayemet, Rokach, Halacha, Hashalom or Kibbutz Galuyot. Use a sign (preferably in Hebrew: ירושלים). People will be going to Jerusalem anytime, so only take rides that can bring you the whole way.\\n\\n# HaShalom is usually very easy during daytime, but other junctions can work as well. \\n# At Kibbutz Galuyot, stand at at 3780 st. junction (32°02\\'47.4\"N 34°47\\'09.5\"E) rather than the bus stop. \\n# The La Guardia on-ramp is not very [[hitchhiker\\'s safety|safe]], not a lot of space for traffic to stop, but it\\'s walkable from the center and of course, people \\'\\'do\\'\\' stop. [[User:Guaka|guaka]] used it twice and it didn\\'t take longer than 10 minutes.\\n# Arlozorov might be slower since traffic is heading in many different directions.\\n\\n# [[User:Guaka|guaka]] has had okay results with taking a local bus (Kavim 168 and some others) to the Tsomet Aluf Zede junction in Ramat Gan.\\n\\n[[User:Roaming Pencil|Roaming Pencil]] has done it several times from different junctions and would recommend never accepting partway rides or taking any road other than Road 1, if possible. There are always people heading to Jerusalem down this route. \\n\\nKeep in mind that Jerusalem is quite big and spread over mountains and hills, which makes it less walkable than Tel AViv. You\\'ll probably need to use public transport (or walk a lot) once you get there.\\n\\n=== To [[Nablus]] ===\\nTake bus 127 to the second but last stop, walk on to highway 5, enjoy hitching in on-ramp since there won\\'t be highway policemen. Be aware that Palestinians are sharing taxi, sometimes you have to pay for the ride. \\n\\n{{Cities Israel}}\\n\\n== Resources ==\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n[[he: תל אביב]]\\n[[de:Tel Aviv]]',\n",

However, in addition to having an individualist culture, Texans also tend to be notoriously friendly and laid-back. \"Southern Hospitality\" lives, if you\\'re willing to engage your rides regardless of their accents, their political ideologies, or whatever nonsense may be pasted on their bumpers.<p> Texas is a massive state, with many of its residents having migrated from other states. Thus it is impossible to state anything \"typical\" of it. Additionally, there are many immigrants from [[Mexico]], from whom you will receive many rides. The casual kindness of Mexicans can often be your salvation, and they\\'ll just throw you in the back of the pickup without a second thought.  Maybe this is because hitchhiking is more common there\\n\\n__TOC__\\n\\n== Roads ==\\n\\n=== Shoulders ===\\nVery wide shoulders are built along the side of almost all highways, making it easy for people to pull over. [[Texas]] has some of the most abundant shoulders in the country.\\n\\n=== Interchanges ===\\n[[split-traffic interchange|Split-traffic interchanges]] are unfortunately often found in the more urban areas of the central and eastern parts of the state, but are not common outside major metropolitan areas.\\n\\n== Law ==\\n\\n=== Statute ===\\n\\nhttps://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/TN/htm/TN.552.htm\\n\\n Chapter 552.007. SOLICITATION BY PEDESTRIANS. (a) A person may not stand in a roadway \\'\\'(see definition below)\\'\\' to solicit a ride, contribution, employment, or business from an occupant of a vehicle, except that a person may stand in a roadway to solicit a charitable contribution if authorized to do so by the local authority having jurisdiction over the roadway.\\n\\n Chapter  552.0071 For purposes of a solicitation under Subsection (a), a roadway is defined to include the roadbed, shoulder, median, curbs, safety zones, sidewalks, and utility easements located adjacent to or near the roadway.\\n\\nAlthough the previous version of this paragraph claimed the opposite, the above statute clearly states that hitchhiking in the state of Texas is illegal. In practice however, law enforcement in the state typically leave hitchhikers alone. As long as you aren\\'t obstructing traffic or doing anything unsafe, you should be ok.\\n\\n\\n=== Pedestrian Rights ===\\nPedestrian rights in [[Texas]] are among the friendliest in the country. Pedestrians are allowed on virtually every single road in [[Texas]] including interstates, with the exception of a few busy urban corridors.

Though the only trouble with the law I ever encountered hitchhiking was in Beaumont.  The police officer was not happy when I corrected him about the actual legislation regarding hitchhiking and basically told me to scram.  Luckily, the first person I ran into at the nearby gas station gave me a ride :)  As a single female, I was never waiting longer than twenty minutes, even coming out of big cities.  One guy who picked me up in Port Arthur couldn\\'t take me anywhere, but called his friend who was going to my exact destination that afternoon.  And once a guy from Houston bought me dinner and a hotel room to stay for the night.  I was gifted a Bible from a theology student once, and he said a really nice prayer for me as well, even though he knew I wasn\\'t religious it was still a nice gesture.

The sheer number of cars means you will get a ride fairly quickly. Otherwise, ask at truck stops (ask truckers and regular cars). Pilot truck stops have free WiFi. The attendants are usually cool unless they think you\\'re begging and/or scamming (something that people unfortunately see way too often and which can also make it difficult to get rides). I had pretty decent luck, making it over 1000 miles from Austin TX to Jacksonville FL in 2 days. I met some very kind people (including one trucker who let me sleep on the spare bunk in his truck) but I also got asked for sex by 2 drivers in texas. Hitchhiking in the states is a real bummer for me because of the way people regard you - most assume you\\'re a begger, criminal, prostitute or all 3. They never consider that you could be doing this by choice and after this trip I understand why riding freight is so popular. Definately agree with the comment above that people would rather give you money than a ride. That said, its definately possible to have great experiences; be polite, try to seem \"wholesome\" and throw in a m\\'am/sir. As in other states, a lot of drivers told me they only gave me a ride as a female alone, and wouldn\\'t have picked up a man or a couple. -Liz, December 2017\\n\\n=== Cities ===\\n* [[Austin (Texas)|Austin]]\\n* [[Abeline (Texas)|Abeline]]\\n* [[Dallas]]\\n* [[El Paso (Texas)|El Paso]]\\n* [[Houston (Texas)|Houston]]\\n* [[Laredo]]\\n* [[San Antonio (Texas)|San Antonio]]\\n* [[Midland (Texas)|Midland/Odessa]]\\n* [[Amarillo]]\\n* [[Waco (Texas)|Waco]]\\n\\n\\n2023, November.\\n\\nFrom New Mexico to Louisiana, across the panhandle, along I-20, through DFW.

It was conquered by [[Israel]] in 1967 and annexed in 1982, but is still claimed by [[Syria]]. You can not pass here between Israel and Syria, and while in Syria the only city you can visit is [[Quneitra]], a ghost town controlled by UN forces.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\nNote: When hitchhiking, always ask where the driver is going, and do not say your destination. It is then for you to decide whether to get in the car or not.\\n \\n=== To [[Jerusalem]], [[Dead Sea]], or [[Eilat]] ===\\nWarning: the primary route for hitchhiking south from the Golan, passes the [[West Bank]] and areas such as Jericho. Pay attention to every ride you take and choose your drivers carefully.\\n\\nFrom the Golan the first goal to reach is the Tsemach Junction, which is situated at the bottom (southern) tip of the Kinneret. From a local junction, make your way to preferably Highway 98 and head south, but depending where you are, Highway 92 also leads to the Tsemach Junction. If you happen to be in the upper eastern part of the Golan, Highway 90 west of the Kinneret will also do, but will be much more difficult, because many people stop in Tiberias, which is a relatively large city, and will possibly require leaving a the city, which can be rather difficult. \\n\\nAfter the Tsemach Junction your next goal is the Beit Ha\\'Arava Junction which is reached by continuing south on Highway 90. From there, you can either chose to go to Jerusalem, or continue on to either the Dead Sea or Eilat. On the way to Beit Ha\\'arava, a common location for drivers is Beit She\\'an which is also a location that many people hitchhike from.\\n\\n=== To [[Tiberias]] ===\\nThere are two ways of getting to Tiberias, either going around the top of the Kinneret, or its bottom. Depending on where you are, you will have to decide which is more convenient for you. Going around the bottom is usually the easiest and simplest way, but there obviously places where going over the top just makes more sense. To go around the bottom, your first goal is the Tsemach Junction at the bottom tip of the Kinneret. There are three ways of getting there: a) Taking Highway 98, which runs along the eastern border of [[Israel]] southward down from the Golan. b) Taking Highway 92, which runs along the eastern bank of the Kinneret. c)Take Highway 98 to Route 789, which runs by such towns as Afik, Ne\\'ot Golan, Bnei Yehuda, and Giv\\'at Yoav, to Highway 92 and then southward. Many drivers tend to take option \"c\" and is usually a good choice.\\nIn terms of going over the top of the Kinneret there are also two options: a)taking Highway 91 to Highway 90 and the head southward, or take Highway 87 to Highway 90 and head southward.\\n\\n=== Continuing to Jerusalem ===\\n[[File:Golan Heighthi.jpg|300px|right]]\\nIf you ride doesn\\'t go to Jerusalem (most do) but continues south towards the Dead Sea, get off at the Beit HaArava Junction, and continue at the [[trempiada]] at the beginning of Highway 1 going west to Jerusalem. From here, it is best to wait for a ride that is going directly to Jerusalem without any stop (most do, or even continue beyond Jerusalem), unless your goal is not actually to get to Jerusalem, but a settlement along the way, such as Ma\\'ale Adummim, in which case there should be people headed there as well.\\n\\n=== Continuing to the Dead Sea and Eilat ===\\nEither pass the Beit HaArava Junction or just continue south from it. Everyone going south will be going at least as far as the Dead Sea, which is just 2 kilometers south. Depending on where part of the Dead Sea you want, just stick to the Highway and go as far south as you chose. To get to Eilat, just continue south on the highway, as far as possible until it hits Eilat, which is approximately 200 kilometers south of the Beit HaArava Junction.\\n\\n== Hitching in ==\\n\\n=== From [[Jerusalem]] ===\\nYour first goal is the Beit HaArava Junction, which connects Highway 1 going west from Jerusalem, to Highway 90, which goes north to the Kinneret. \\n\\nFrom the city center you have two options: \\n\\n1. You can either take service taxi (\"Sheirut\") Number 36, from Damascus gate of the old city, in the direction of Abu Dis, a ride of 5 NIS only. Go down in Maale Adumin junction and continue hitchhiking west. If you take this ride you get directly to road #1, from which many rides will take you straight to Beit HaArava Junction. \\n\\n2. Or take buses 25, 4 or 4A from West Jerusalem to get to Har Ha\\'tsofim Junction, (French Hill). The place is usually crowded with hitchhikers, and drivers stop often. Most likely they will go only half ways, in which case you should ask to go down in the entry junction to their settlement, and continue hitchhiking from the bus station. \\n\\nFrom the Beit HaArava Junction, head north on Road 90 until you reach the Tsemach Junciton at the bottom of the Kinneret. From there, You can either hitchhike to Tiberias by going westwards on Road 90, or use the [[Trempiyada]] (hitching spot) up to the Golan. People either drive up to Road 92 or Road 98 from there. Road 98 goes right up to the Golan, and Road 92 runs along the west coast of the Kinneret from where you can pick up Roads 789 or 87 to the Golan. Highway 789 connects to Road 98 from where you can chose to either continue north or head south. Road 87 also connects to 98, but a bit later, and it also turns west over the Kinneret or east through the center of the Golan until it picks up 98 at its end. \\n\\n\\n=== From [[Dead Sea]] and [[Eilat]] ===\\nContinue up Highway 90 and follow the direction from the Beit HaArava Junction shown in the directions from Jerusalem.\\n\\n{{Cities Israel}}\\n[[Category:Israel]]\\n[[Category:Syria]]',\n",

If you are lucky it can be easy if you get to a Turkish truck. Take bus #27 from the centre (e.g. Kamara) until the very end of the line. [UPDATE: bus #83 no longer starts where bus #27 finishes. Instead ask your #27 bus driver where to get off for bus #83] Switch to bus #83 and go a few stops until you see the motorway . Get off at Filothei (Φιλοθέη) when you see a  BP Oil in green colour rest area on the other side of the motorway. Just follow the bus and go under the motorway to reach the other side. Once you are there, rally the petrol station personnel to help you . Show them your Istanbul (or Kavala or whatever) sign and ask them to tell you if they notice someone going to Turkey. Be prepared to convince the paranoid drivers that you are not wanted by the police and show them your passport. Getting a ride can take anything between one minute and five hours. If it just does not work at the petrol station see the options below (thumbing up on the road etc). Also, there should be a toll station (peage) about [http://hitchwiki.org/maps/?place=6374 15 km east of Lagynas], near Analipsi (where bus #83a is supposed to go). When you get to the border you might want to switch to a passenger car because the truck could be stuck in customs for a while.\\n\\nBus #83 goes all the way to Lagkadas (Λαγκαδάς). If you stay on the bus until it reaches this small town, you can try hitching out in the direction of Kavala, Istanbul, etc.\\n\\nUpdate (July 2022): the options listed above are extremely outdated and not very helpful. This route is still difficult, but there are better options.\\n\\n1) with bus number 83 you can get to Laguna from where there\\'s about 20 minutes walk to the knot that ties local road 2 and highway 2. Here you can get directly to the entrance of the highway for Kavala where you filter out any cars not going your way. The traffic is very slow but the cars can stop and they get a good look at you. There\\'s a gas station about 30km down before Evangelios\\n\\n2) The highway entrance after BP near Megalohare kantina is still very local, but there\\'s enough traffic so it\\'s possible to hitch longer rides. Since Greeks don\\'t stop often we opted to go for the first ride which brought us to the 3rd option\\n\\n3) 40,7214723, 22,9740939 or the spot right after the exit for Laguna is risky. The cars drive fast so be careful and there\\'s a high probability the highway patrol tells you to get off. However we hitched a ride within 5 minutes with a Kavala sign as there are a lot of Turkish truck drivers going from Athens to Istanbul. \\n\\nNone of these options are perfect, but they seem way more likely than the BP station since 4-5 hours of hitchhiking there yielded only 2 rides going to Kilkis. Since we changed strategy we only needed about an hour and a half in total. Good luck!\\n\\n=== North-West to [[Skopje]] ([[North Macedonia]]) ===\\n\\nOption 1:\\nDon\\'t bother to hitch hike to the border! There are free busses from the city centre which belong to the casinos across the border just before Gevgelija. You can find these buses on Tsimiski street. They are easy to recognize (the name of the casino is printed on the bus, and it is written \"free shuttle\").  The buses leave at 17:00 and 21:00 so only useful for arriving in Skopje at night. \\n\\nAs of May 2024, it appears that the free shuttle no longer exists.\\n\\nOption 2:\\nTake a Bus to Agios Athanasios. From \"KTEL Macedonia Bus station\" lines 81A, 89B, 89K go there. You can hitch on the nearby junction to Highway A1/E75 to Skopje.\\n\\nOption 3:\\nActually hitch hike. Highway EO2 effectively runs down the center of Thessaloniki to Edessas. It\\'s a normal road (called \"Monastiriou\", \"Egnagia\" and others) up until the junction with the ring road (A2/E90). You can walk down it (going north-west) while hitch hiking. There are gas stations along it where you can hitch hike. Just past the ring road there is a stop light before the ramp where you can hitch hike. Just beyond that there is a very big shoulder where you can hitch hike. Continue following EO2 from there for 10km (in a car by now ideally) and you are at Agios Athanasios as in option 2 above. Take the exit to A1/E75 to Skopje.\\n\\n=== South to [[Athens]] ===\\n\\nTake Buses #31, #12, #8 or #78 to the bus station called KTEL. From there take bus #80 or #80A to the village called \\'\\'Malgara\\'\\' (some of these buses don\\'t go all the way to Malgar). You can go out on the stop \"\\'\\'25 Martiou\\'\\'\" which is the closest to the tolls but on the bus, it\\'s announced differently (in Greek \\'\\'Ikostis Pmptis Martiou\\'\\' ask the driver). There you can ask and find the Malgara Toll Station toll station (in Greek \\'\\'diodia\\'\\') on E75 easily. You\\'ll have to walk about 2 km to find it, but then there is a possibility to get a ride even straight to Athens. Before you enter the motorway where the toll station is, you will have to go through some fields. If it\\'s night be careful, just before the motorway there is a small ridge that is a bit steep and there is water flowing down, you need to find your way around it. If it\\'s day, from the fields you can see a small canteen on the motorway, head to that direction, you can bypass the ridge there very easily and also you don\\'t need to jump the fence (easy to jump though) because there is an entrance/exit for the canteen. From the canteen you will see the tolls, they are less than 50 m away.\\n\\n\\nFor those not wanting to take a bus or want to hitch closer to the city (and aren\\'t scared to walk), go to the the A1 motorway going towards Athens. It runs right beside the city centre. Starting from near the train station after walking 2 km you will arrive at the international bus station. From there it\\'s a 6km walk along the motorway to where the E90 highway joins on to the A1 road to Athens. This is a good spot due to the high amount of Turkish trucks coming straight from the border and bypassing the city as well as any traffic coming from the north. Stand at the end of the onramp where there is a shoulder for traffic to pull over and you can get a ride to Larissa or even Athens.\\n\\n=== West to [[Igoumenitsa]] {{E|90}} ===\\n\\nGo to the train station, which is also the inner-city bus station. From here, take bus 8 KTEL (the KTEL are the blue and white buses) to Makedonia bus station. From there, you can catch the bus #80 to the end of the line, then follow motorway signs walking (approx. 2km) to the [[toll station]]. Or rather than taking bus #80, just walk across the road (roundabout) till you come to an [[on-ramp]]\\n\\nIn [[Igoumenitsa]] you can get a ride with trucks over the sea to [[Italy]].\\n\\n\\n=== North-East to [[Sofia]] ([[Bulgaria|BG]]) ===\\n\\nTake bus 83 (any of them will get you there, even the express) from Aristotellous Square stop (on Egnatia Street). You want to get off at the Kombo Gerokomeiou exit (Google maps doesnt show the bus stops this far north, but on the opposite side of the highway is a gas station called Derveni Gas S.A.).  MAKE SURE you explain to the bus driver you want to get off at this exit. Otherwise, he might not get off the highway here and the next stop is too far to walk back from. Stand on the shoulder of the ramp. There is not a lot of traffic here, so it might take you up to an hour to get a ride, but I think its worth it because most of the cars going as far as Bulgaria will get on the highway here. Good luck!\\n\\nUpdate (August \\'22)\\nDon\\'t take bus 83! You have to take bus 83B to get to the right place! Taking bus 83 will make you walk for a long time until teaching the ramp.\\n\\nAlso, I wasn\\'t so lucky there. I waited a total of 4 hours before I gave up.\\nI think it\\'s better to go to the Shell gas station at 40°41′01.72″N 22°56′28.28″E and ask people. Thumbing on ramps is pretty difficult in Greece.\\nYou can take bus 53 until Strophe \\nOraiokastrou to get to the gas station.\\n\\n\\n=== North to [[Kilkis]] ([[Greece]]) ===\\n\\nBasically you need to take 2 buses. Very similar to the above direction to Sofia. But this time it is bus #27 / #27a  and bus #84 / # 84a. You can change buses in two different places.\\n\\nThis way is faster as you don\\'t need to stay on bus #27 so long. Take bus #27 or #27a and get off at Minerva stop in Oreokastrou suburb. If you walk some hundreds of meters from the bus stop where you get off, in the direction the bus was going, you will reach a crossroads and on your left you will see another bus stop. From there you can take bus #84.\\n\\nThis way is easier because you don\\'t need to change bus stops, it is the way mentioned in the Northeast to Sofia section. Take the bus #27 or #27a from the centre the the final s top \\'\\'Platia Stavroupolis\\'\\' (Stavroupolis square). Then at the same place take bus #84 / #84a and you\\'re already on your way.\\n\\nStay on bus #84 whilst it passes through 2 villages, Liti and Melissochiori. When it is out of Melissochiori, at one point the bus will cross the road going to Kilkis and you will see signs for Kilkis. When you are at the cross roads you can press the stop button on the bus and it will stop just after the cross. There is a bus stop there. Then you are at a great spot for hitching a ride to Kilkis, Gallikos or even North Macedonia (but not the most common way to Skopje. it is a different border).\\n\\n== Sleep ==\\n\\nSome have had luck asking the good people at Mikropolis/Micropolis Social Space, (see [http://wikimapia.org/#lat=40.6360852&lon=22.939539&z=17&l=0&m=s&v=9&show=/13098671/Mikropolis]). They were very friendly and could advise on where to squat for the night.\\n\\n=== Camping ===\\n\\n====The university campus ====\\n\\nThe university campus in Thessaloniki is just in the city centre and it seems to be a perfect place to sleep in your van/tent/sleeping bag, but IT IS NOT! \\n\\nIt\\'s \\'\\'\\'NOT SAFE THERE\\'\\'\\' \\'\\'(upd.2022)\\'\\'. The drug business moved there, as unbelievable as it sounds. People selling drugs and fighting over things related to them, passerbys get attacked. If someone has a van maybe it\\'s okay. But sleeping in a tent or sleeping bag is an invitation to get robbed. It\\'s the worst place to sleep, really. Plus, starting from 2019 it is a place where a lot of immigrants sleep. Police has no right to enter that area because of some tragic past, i.e. it\\'s ideal place for drug sellers and crime.\\n\\n====Forest Recreational Center====\\n\\nForest Recreational Center near the Zoo (\\'\\'Neapoli-Sykies, 554 38\\'\\') which is located on the hills above the city can be a solution. However, depending on your choice of the \"height\" of that forest (after highway it becomes more wild, before highway it more like a park) there can be pack of stray dogs which is not a good gift. \\n\\nHomeless animals are a big problem in the big cities as Thessaloniki or Athens, so you better have something to protect yourself from them during the night (get some long sticks near you). Normally they are scared of \"throwing a rock gesture\" because some greeks do that against dogs. So, if you see an unfriendly dog try to pretend taking a rock from the ground - it should work for lonely dog.\\n\\n====Airport====\\n\\nPlace to stay for a short term. It is not closing for the night, so you can always overnight there.\\n\\n====Other====\\n\\nWe slept at a deserted camping space by the beach in Ag. Triada, which is really worth a visit. We even made a big fire at night and it didn\\'t disturb anybody. This place is about 30km south of Thessaloniki and you can reach it within 1,5h by bus. From the famous ottoman tower take the bus to ikea. At the last stop ask for the bus to Perea and Ag. Triada. The last bus will pass by the airport and enter a cupple of villages before you get to Triada. Ask for the old camping at the beach, locals will guide you.\\n\\n== Public Transport ==\\nGoogle maps doesn\\'t really know how buses work, so they are unable to get you directions from point A to B in the city. So, if you want to move inside the city using a public transport download special application (\\'\\'in 2022 there is an application called \"Moovit\").\\n\\nThe tickets for the buses in the city cost 0.80€ and sometimes 0.90€ (0.40€ for students). 2€ for airport route.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Blackriding\\'\\'\\' is possible. It\\'s risky because there is no chance of recognising controllers before they enter the bus, however the very control is rare. \\n\\nControllers are using civil clothes (they doesn\\'t use a special clothes, they just unzip theirs jackets with controllers badges in the middle of the road, so they already know if you didn\\'t validate your ticket). If you speak to the controller in a foreign language (showing that you\\'re a tourist, not an illegal immigrant) they\\'ll just leave you alone. If not, they first ask 30 euro for the tax, in that case you can say you don\\'t have one. Then they ask your an ID card, you say that you don\\'t have it with you and then they\\'ll just give you a paper to note your name and address, where you can write any fake name. Or even simpler you can give your real passport and they are supposed to send you the bill to your country. It\\'s 100% SURE that they will not.\\n\\nThere were big movements in this city about not paying for public transport. Many people don\\'t pay and controls are rare. [[User: HHer-Vert|HHer-Vert]] was living in that very city 5 years, and got controlled only 2-3 times.\\n\\n== Shower ==\\n\\nOne even safer option is the student residence. Noone here checks who enters. Ever. Even if they see you like a complete stranger with a tons of baggage and ask you anything, just tell them that you are visiting a friend or whatever. After you enter, go upstairs to any floor and you\\'ll find common baths everywhere. It is located near the swimming pool at the city center. You can enter 24h. Location on map: https://goo.gl/maps/H8WZU \\n\\n\\n== Free food ==\\n\\nThessaloniki is perhaps the only place in the world where you can eat everyday for free easily. \\n\\n===Fititiki Leshi (Φοιτητική Λέσχη) upd:2022=== \\nNext to the campus of Aristotle University, Egnatia street, after the crossroad with 3rd September street there is the university canteen. (\\'\\'Address: Egnatia, Thessaloniki 546 36, Greece\\'\\'). Ask anybody for \\'\\'fititiki leschi\\'\\'. There you can find a free full meal three times per day: 8.00-10.00, 12.00-15.00 and 18.00-20.00. These free meals are provided for the university students, but even if you\\'re not one, you don\\'t have to pay and you don\\'t have to show a student ID or any document (but due to cobtrol re-enforcement you could be asked for your ID). \\n\\nTo avoid control you need to be a part of a big crowd which is hard to control, therefore try to be there during the most crowded time (normally the beginning of opening) and you won\\'t be controlled. Another \\'life-hack\\' that you can use if you have been asked for your ID is to tell that you just started to study greek language for university and you don\\'t own by now any proof of that (there are a lot of foreign students who really study greek for that reason, and yes - they don\\'t have any proof in the beginning). It is harder during the weekends (or holidays) because there are less people and have no crowd, so if you look suspicious you can be asked for an ID.\\n\\nJust follow the queue, take the food and eat it. There\\'s nothing to be afraid of, just try to look more or less like a student. Only disadvantage is that it is closed on weekends, summer holidays and not-working days for the university in general. Picture of the building [http://www.makthes.gr/filestore/modules/news/68918/lesxi.jpg here].\\n\\nAlternative entrance:  when you are there look to your right. At the end of the grass there is a stair case, you can go up directly to the dining hall (if it\\'s opened, if it\\'s not you can knock or wave through the door to another student, normally they will let you in).\\n\\n\\'\\'There is another option (easy in the morning, otherwise is more difficult):\\'\\'\\n\\n===Alfa foititiki estia (Α\\' φοιτητική εστία):===\\nYour aim is the same - free student food from student canteen, however now you are going to search it directly in canteen of student\\'s dorms. There is no control at the entrance of student\\'s dorms. The restaurant is located on the first floor, at the left side from the big marble stairs. The doors are opened at the meal time. \\n\\nYou can find it by following \\'\\'address: Stilponos Kiriakidi 17, Thessaloniki 546 36, Greece\\'\\'\\n\\nThe best way is to be hosted there by any student through hosting application or ask some students living there to help you get the dinner (regularly even if you cannot get main dish they provide you orangers or apples which no one takes). If you cannot find a student helping you, you can try get some food by your own, follow this instruction:\\n\\n- They are controling IDs only during day time and evening time, so it\\'s very easy to get there in the morning (8 a.m - 10 a.m). In the morning there are almost no people eating, so staff is really bored of checking IDs or is even absent.\\n\\n- Take the trey with food and go eat as all do at the table. Don\\'t be suspicious, you are a student now. Many students doesn\\'t really eat there, they are taking food away which they can physically take out and leave the dorms. You can do the same.\\n\\n- Normally control-staff are crossing out the numbers on the paper. Each student has his own number on ID-card and he tells it in the moment of entering. It\\'s another strategy of pretending to be a student: you tell random number in greek language (p.e. 103 = ekato tria, 25 - ikosi pende, 207 = diakosa epta, etc), so they will cross it out. Don\\'t worry, students rarely take morning breakfast, so you are not \"eating someone\\'s food in his place\".\\n\\n- In the end, if you did not get any food, you are desperate and frustrated, you can try to tell staff that you are an adventurer, they are pretty understanding. They will give you food anyway if you came in the restaurant\\'s closing time (10 a.m; 2.30 p.m & 9 p.m). There are always extra food, which they give to random people. Just ask.\\n\\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\\n\\n[[nomad:Thessaloniki]] [[trash:Thessaloniki]]\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|Greece}}\\n__NOTOC__\\n\\n[[Category:Greece]]\\n[[Category:E75]]\\n[[Category:E79]]\\n[[Category:E90]]\\n[[Category:Route Athens - Thessaloniki]]\\n\\n[[de:Thessaloniki]]',\n",

There are buses (M49) and trains (operated by Regiotrans, not the national Railway CFR. Check https://regiocalatori.ro/#/cautare/ or google maps for departure times) going in this direction.

There will be a bus line emerging on the right where a bus to Kamez runs. It will have Kamez written on it, and probably a number it takes roughly 20-25 minutes. You pay for the ticket in the bus, but not to the driver - there will be a ticket vendor walking around the bus who can sell you one. Get off at the last stop, from where you can walk 20 metres forward to a roundabout. You can hitchhike directly after it.\\n\\n=== West towards [[Durrës]] (over Vorë) ===\\n\\nWalk along the \"Durrës road\" (Rruga Durrësit) until you find a suitable spot. A good spot is past a roundabout (about 15 minutes\\' walk) where you can board minibuses to [[Durrës]]. There is an extra line for buses. Keep in mind that the further you walk, the faster will the cars drive.\\n\\n\\nThere is a bus going to Cityy Park shopping center but it also stops to Megatec mall which is where you must drop off. if you forget and drop off at city park walk back to the underpass to go to the right direction toward Durres. In Albania cars stop to the highway, but better if you find a suitable spot because it is too dangerous and only minivans and taxis, which ask for money, will stop. If you get off on the Megatec mall, you can walk back to the highway where there\\'s a Gulf gas station nearby\\n\\n=== South towards [[Vlorë]] ===\\n\\nThe main road south goes from Durrës, so use the advice above. Have a look at the map so you know approximately where you want to get out. Let your driver know that you really don\\'t want to go into the city, but would like to get dropped somewhere outside, on the road leading south. There is a bridge in the southern part of the city with a roundabout, at \"Plepat\". Get out there.\\n\\nIf you want to go to Vlore without taking again public transport from Durres than is better if you go through the old road and not through the highway going to Durres: From the city center take a bus going to Sharrë which will bring you to the end of the city. The last stop is already a good spot for hitchhiking, but you can even walk further if you want, cars can stop everywhere. From there can find cars going to Durres which will drop you to a roundabout where all cars going further south will pass.\\n\\n=== East towards [[North Macedonia]] ===\\n\\nGet to East Gate Tirana (TEG) enormous shopping mall (the biggest in Albania). There was a new very big roundabout next to it. It seemed like a very good spot to start hitchhiking as it is at the outskirts of the city. One could try asking people in Tirana or at the tourist information for a bus to this mall. \\n\\n\\nOpposite to the Clocktower (albanian: Kulla e Sahatit) there is a bus stop from where a bus to Tirana East Gate leaves every 20 minutes, from 9.00 to 21.00\\n\\n== Hitching In ==\\n\\nEntering the city from the west, on Rruga Durresit (coming from Durrës, or from the north) could be slightly tiresome if you get dropped early on. The road through the suburbs could become rather long, and it\\'s dense with very busy traffic. Catching a ride to the center could be difficult (but is certainly possible, though a lot of taxis will stop for you), and you might be better off just walking or taking a very cheap city bus (40 lek - 30 cents). But on the other hand, it\\'s not unlikely that your ride takes you straight to the center, or wherever you are going.\\n\\n== Places to Visit ==\\n\\nTirana has a lot to offer for a person that decides to stay. The Lake is probably the best place to pass the day and to sleep by night. It has big park where people go to walk and run and there isn\\'t a lot of noise. Dajti mountain is an attraction. You could walk for a daily trip or take the Linza bus and then the cable-car (400lek each way) that brings you to the mountain. The Blloku area is a touristic trap with a lot of modern bars to go and reduce your travel budget. There is a bazaar with cheap clothes in Kombinati open daily till 4pm. \\n\\n== Places to Avoid ==\\n\\n== Accommodation and Sleep ==\\n\\n\\n[[File:tirana.jpg|right|thumb|typical road scene in Tirana]]\\n=== Private sector ===\\nIn Tirana one can easily get accommodated in so called private sector: these are people who have their apartments arranged to accepts occasional tourists. It is safe, quite cheap (you can talk about how much you can pay), you get friendly company (if needed) and tips how and where. To find these kind of places just ask some more tidily looking folks on the street, or in Internet cafes and other similar places.\\n\\n=== Hostel ===\\nTirana Backpacker Hostel on \\'\\'Rruga Myslim Shyrit\\'\\' (near the highway towards [[Elbasan]]), \"Villa 7\" in a back alley, behind the Alpet petrol station has free wifi and may allow you to pitch your tent in the garden for less than the normal price of a bed.

The city is a famous haven for car manufacturers and thus it\\'s surroundings are not exactly beautiful once outside of the city centre. However, there are plenty of fields to sleep in, public transport is cheap and the pizza is superb.\\n__NOTOC__\\n== Hitching out ==\\n\\n=== West towards [[Chambéry]], [[Lyon]], [[Grenoble]] ([[France]]) ===\\nThe best way is starting from the petrol station \"Rivoli Nord\", in Alpignano town, in which you can get very easily. Take the bus 32 (ticket \"biglietto interurbano\", costs less than 2 euros) and go till the headline \"Robotti\". From there take \\'\\'Via Rivoli\\'\\' and walk it down till the end (more or less 1 km). Right before the highway there is a a small country road on the left which goes along the highway. It will take you directly to the petrol station. Once there you just have to follow the fence until you reach the revolving doors. Another way to get here if coming from \\'\\' Mezcal squat\\'\\' in \\'\\'Colegno\\'\\' is by train from the Colegno train stop and by getting of at the next one in Alpignano. Coming out of the train station you are already on Via Rivoli. \\n\\nOn the {{Ait|32}} [[E70]] in Susa (about 20km from Torino), there is a truck stop (with petrol station and restaurant) where you will find a lot of trucks going both ways to [[Chambéry]] or [[Turin]]. You can get in Susa by train and the spot worth the effort.\\n\\nAn efficient way to get a ride westwards is to get to the toll (pedaggio in Italian) at Bruere. Take a bus to Macario stop on Corso Francia and walk along Via Bruere until you across the bridge and see the tollgate on your left. Get off the road and walk through the maize field along the motorway direction, you will see the toll office. There is a rail fence which is easy to climb over, other places along the edge are splitted by net fences. Stand by the outmost toll ramp with a sign indicate your direction and waiting for your ride. A service area is just 1km ahead.\\n\\n=== East and South ===\\nThe best way is starting from the petrol station \"Nichelino sud\", in Nichelino town, in which you can get very easily. Take the bus 35 (ticket \"biglietto interurbano\", costs less than 2 euros) and go till the stop \"Torino\". Than you have to walk for something like 1,5-2km following: Via Torino (keep it for approx 100m), Via Gozzano (keep it for approx 1km), turn left on via Vernea (keep it for approx 100m) turn left on Via Napoli. After 50m you\\'ll see a small country road which takes you directly in the petrol station. There\\'s no fence to climb.\\n\\n=== North ===\\n{{Coords|45.1288|7.6906}}<br>\\nThere is a gas station called \"Stazione di Servizio ENI\" thats on the {{Ait|55}} north of Turin. A lot of traffic goes towards [[Milano]], but there are some cars going north towards [[Aosta]] / [[Bern]] / [[Germany]].\\nYou can reach the gas station by public transport and walking. Take a bus or a local train to the train station Turino Stura. From there its a 2,5 km walk. This is the adress of the gas station: Tangenziale Nord, KM 16,315, 10156 Torino. If you come from the back street (Strada del Molino del Villaretto) there is a gate.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|Italy}}\\n{{hitchbase_city|167}}\\n{{Category|City\\'s}}\\n[[Category:Italy]]\\n\\n[[fr:Turin]]',\n",

Toulouse\\'s bypass is complicated, so try to change vehicles at a [[péage]] when entering the motorway. If you change at the exit péage before entering the Toulouse bypass a lot of passing traffic won\\'t be going the same way as you.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n=== North towards [[Bordeaux]], [[Agen]], [[Limoges]], [[Paris]] {{E|9}} {{E|72}} {{Afr|62}} ===\\n\\nOption #1: to get directly to the toll (\\'\\'péage\\'\\') starting the highway A62. From the metro station \"La Vache\" (Metro line 2), take the bus 29/60/69/105, get off at \"Lapin\", walk ahead (on Avenue de Front) for about 75 meters and take the first left (Chemin du Lapin) until you reach a pedestrian bridge. From there you can jump across a small barrier, get in something that looks like a small abandoned field and walk along ahead for about 100 meters. You\\'ll see a one-way northbound motorway connection road to what will become the péage after about 500 meters. You want to walk along that portion, staying as much as possible on the right side of the safety barrier (not very dangerous actually, but if the police see you, they won\\'t stop to annoy you). In my opinion (Hertinek, aka Uncle_Franek), this is the ultimate option to hitch north out of Toulouse. I\\'ve lived in the area almost all my life, and have experienced many different spots. Today I always use this one. Two busstops after \"Lapin\" you can leave the bus at stop \"Lapparou\" as well, walk ahead 50 meters, turn left Impasse des Horticulteurs at the end of which you will find a red wall and fence which you need to climb over, which is probably possible as the fence is damaged - this way you are only a few meters from the péage, which then saves you from walking along the motorway for half a kilometer. Take a HUGE sign with you as the toll is large. \\n\\nOption #2 : a smaller peage but maybe easier to reach (I had to get there because there were policemen and higway employees at the main one), from the subway station La Vache, take the bus 69 toward Bruguières, then stop at Pont rouge, you\\'ll need to walk a few hundred meters, cross the bridge and you\\'ll be at Saint Jory\\'s peage, I got a ride to Agen waiting just a few minutes.\\n\\nOption #3: you can walk to the entrance of the \"périphérique\" (ring road) at Pont Jumeaux as well (10mns walk from metro Canal du Midi), there are 2 traffic lights there. Easy to go there (plus standing at the péage might be forbidden), nice spot, but took me like 1 hour to get a ride, both times.\\n\\nOption #4: REALLY EASY. A really good idea is to take the metro to Balma Gramont, from there, 5 min away there is a ramp entrance to the \"périphérique\", a lots of cars go in that direction, cars can easily see you and stop, you can find people going torwards Bordeaux(A62) Montauban/Paris(A20) or Albi (A68). I\\'ve hitchhiked several times there any day any time of year and sometimes I\\'ve not been alone, there are often other hitchhikers going out Notrh from Toulouse there (especially during the summer). The big advantage is that you\\'ll get there really easily, compared to the time it takes you to go to the péages, and if the person that stops isn\\'t going in your direction they can always leave you at a péage. So if you\\'re heading anywhere North of Toulouse you can think of starting at Balma.\\n\\n=== Northeast, towards [[Albi]] {{AutorouteFR|68}} ===\\nTake metro line B to stop Borderouge, then change bus 40 or 73 or walk to stop Atlanta. Just walk along the Route d\\'Albi to the road sign post before the road splits to ramp onto A62 and hitch with a sign. The passing traffic goes to Albi via D888 or A68.\\n\\n=== The [[Péage]] towards the East/South-East (Carcassonne, Narbonne, Perpignan, Montpellier) {{AutorouteFR|61}} ===\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nTake metro line B in the direction \\'\\'Ramonville\\'\\' to the very last stop.

A sign reading \\'\\'direction Foix\\'\\' can be useful.<br />\\nIf the driver is not going all the way to Foix or Andorra, he might be able to drop you off at the péage \\'\\'Pamiers\\'\\', from which one can easily continue on.\\n\\n=== Towards [[Tarbes]], [[Pau]], [[Bayonne]]  on highway {{AutorouteFR|64}} ===\\n\\nThere is a toll gate near the small town of Roques, on the highway A64 direction Tarbes/Pau/Bayonne. Take the red Metro to Baso Cambo (last stop) then bus line 50 from Baso Cambo to Roques Acacias (last stop) (buses every 30min at the most, careful not all line 50 buses go to Acacias!)\\n\\nFrom the stop, walk in the direction the bus came from, through a small lot, following the sound of the motorway (you can hear it). After a while you have to climb over a small grassy knoll, and you arrive on a \\'\\'route nationale\\'\\', parallel to the motorway, and from the top of the hump you can see the toll gate in the distance. Walk along the \\'\\'route nationale\\'\\' to your right until you arrive at a roundabout. Go left, over the bridge that crosses the motorway, you\\'re now on the right side, follow the motorway to the toll gate. If no cops are around and you feel lucky you can hitch from the inter-lane spaces (effective but illegal...) or otherwise go to the small service-area just behind (no petrol pumps but people do stop occasionally, and you can always wave a thumb at passing cars).\\n\\nOther Option: Take bus 58 from Basso-Cambo to \"Centre de détention\" (there are not many so check the schedules, but some terminates only at \"Seysse maison d\\'arrêt\" or \"Seysse Gay\", it also works but the walk will be longer). From there walk 10min to the entrance of the motorway https://goo.gl/maps/b9bkxUH2xqB2 .

You can easily find a lift to the petrol station 20km down or further away.\\n\\nYou can also walk directly from the Metro station Basso Cambo or even better Bellefontaine to the highway entrance. From there, you can find a ride to the péage. Even cars exiting the motorway before the \\'\\'péage\\'\\' to go to Roques or Muret will be able to drop you on the \\'\\'route nationale\\'\\' very close to the péage.\\n\\n=== Towards [[Auch]], N124 ===\\nThere is a spot at the [[roundabout]] just in front on the Purpan Hospital (a bunch of public transport stop there).\\n\\n== Metro ==\\nIf you are on a low budget: The security at the entry of the metro stations is watching for people who enter, that they validate their tickets.

In the centre they are more strict and you need to be careful when you change the lines there.\\n\\n== Wild camping ==\\n\\nYou can pitch a tent north of the soccer field on the Pech-David hill south of Toulouse. If you come from the south, you can ask drivers to drop you on route d\\'Espagne and take the cable car to Hôpital Rangueil - Louis Lareng.

It has approximately 100,000 inhabitants. Most of the old town belongs to the UNESCO world heritage, thats also why many tourists come to Trier.\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n=== East, North, South towards everywhere {{Autobahn|1}} ===\\nA good place is the \\'\\'Verteilerkreis\\'\\' in the north-east of the city, which is a roundabout that connects the local roads with the motorway. From the main station it\\'s about 30 minutes walking, but you can also take bus 1, 30, 85 or 86. The bus stop is called Nells Park. It is a good idea to use a [[signs|sign]] at this spot. You can hitch either at the bus stop or walk a little bit further to the on ramp where cars will also have space to stop. Don\\'t stand on the road to Ruwer which leads trough an industrial area parallel to the motorway, there are sometimes prostitutes and you may be misunderstood.\\n\\nIf you want to go from the \\'\\'Verteilerkreis\\'\\' via the [[A1 (Germany)|A1]], [[A48 (Germany)|A48]] towards [[Koblenz]] you may get offered a lift to [[Wittlich]] (happens very often), which is before the first [[rest area|service station]] on the motorway. You can take it, because the ramp in Wittlich-Mitte is a good place to hitch on.\\n\\nFrom \\'\\'Verteilerkreis\\'\\' you have good chances to hitch to [[Hahn Airport]].\\n\\n=== West, North ([[Bitburg]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Belgium]], [[France]]) {{Autobahn|60}}{{Autobahn|64}}===\\n[[File:TrierFH.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Spot to north or west]] \\nTake the bus to \\'\\'Fachhochschule\\'\\' and exit at the terminus. There is enough space to place yourself, uphill is the motorway to Luxembourg and the road straight (B 51) is heading to Bitburg (and from there further to Belgium).\\n\\n=== [[Hitchhiking a boat|Boat]] hitchhiking and [[Train hopping]] ===\\nYou will find a cargo railway station north of Trier in Pfalzel. Maybe you will be lucky here (not tested). \\n\\nYou will notice many Barges on the Mosel River. You may have a chance asking at the watergate. It is on the left Mosel side between the camping site and the industrial area in \\'\\'Zewen\\'\\'. Remember: hitchhiking a barge is very slow. Maybe you can also ask at the small yacht club. It is south of the Watergate.\\n\\n\\n== Public transport ==\\n=== Bus ===\\nTrier has a good bus network. Due to the buses being relatively expensive, walking may be a good option, because Trier isn\\'t this big (you can walk from the very north to the very south in 1 hour).\\n\\nThere is a regular bus connection to Luxembourg served by [http://www.voyages-weber.lu/bus/rgtr/ Voyages Emile Weber] (line 118). With the day ticket you can also use for the local buses in Luxembourg City.\\n\\n\\'\\'Trier Verteilerkreis\\'\\' is a stop of the regular bus line between [[Metz]] <-> [[Thionville]] <-> Luxembourg <-> Trier <-> Hahn Airport. The bus has to be booked in advance at [http://www.flibco.com flibco.com] and is quite expensive, unless you book well in advance. Don\\'t take this, because it is no problem to hitch from Verteilerkreis to Hahn, or from the Fachhochschule spot to Luxembourg/Metz.\\n\\n=== Train ===\\nUsing the train served by [[Deutsche Bahn]] is expensive. From Trier you will find a line to Luxembourg, Koblenz and to [[Saarbrücken]] / [[Kaiserslautern]]. You will definitely (at least at daytime) be faster hitchhiking than using regional trains.\\n\\nIf going through Luxembourg you might be interested in taking trains once you have crossed the border as there is a 2hour ticket that gets you about anywhere for 2€.\\n\\n== Sleeping ==\\n=== Wild camping ===\\nIf you want to hitchhike on to Bitburg, Belgium, Luxembourg the next day you can already approach the hitchhiking spot mentioned above. From there you walk to \"Weisshaus Wald\" it is the next street to the right and find a place somewhere in the forest. Another option is to find a hidden spot at the Mosel river, but a lot of people walking with dogs here. Another option is to climb up the Petrisberg and sleep in the small forest there. For all places: Pitch up in the dark and leave before dawn.\\n\\n=== Hospitality exchange networks ===\\nThere are many students living in Trier. So Trier has a great hospitality exchange network community. You will definitely find accommodation via one of the well know hospitality exchange networks, but it can be difficult during the semester vacations. Maybe you can also try to contact [[User:Quarim|Quarim]].\\n\\n=== Camping ===\\nIn Trier you will find a camping side on the left side of the Mosel River in Trier West.

You can take the bus #39 to get there.\\nThe bus starts at the main rail station inside the city, passing the university, then uphill. When the bus is leaving\\nthe main road, then it is the right time to get out. Go back to the road and start hitchhiking from there. It\\'s an\\naverage place there, because it is behind a curve, but you will be seen soon enough to get away.\\n\\nIf you can get a short ride of about 5km to the former border with Slovenia, take it. There is a small petrol station and some restaurants, drivers have a better opportunity to stop here, so, you can stand next to the main road and tramp or talk with the people who stop to take gas.\\n\\n=== East ([[Ljubljana]]) ===\\n\\nTake a tram, bus 2 or 42 to Opicina , which is a town almost at the border. The main village road becomes the road to the border, getting out of town there are places where vehicles can stop. Recommended place is in front of NLB bank at the end of the town and where cars can stop easily. Just after the border there is a gas station on the motorway, or you can stand by the old road. \\n\\nOr  bus to Sežana anda walk down a little through the city until you see the signal of Ljubljana. You\\'d better hitch hike before getting in the  the highway\\n\\n\\n=== South ([[Koper]], [[Pula]]) ===\\n\\nTake a bus that goes to Aquilinia, for example bus #20 departing from the city centre, direction Muggia. Get off at the first stop in Aquilinia, which is more or less the first stop after passing an industrial district. Walk towards the second stop (if you aren\\'t already there). The second stop is located right after a traffic light and a zebra crossing. In front of you you will see a blue sign which encourages drivers to slow down. A couple of hundred meters further the roads splits, one can either enter the motorway or drive towards Muggia. Probably good to have a sign Koper]. \\n\\n\\n=== West [[Venice]] ===\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nYour best option is to get to a Area Servizio rest stop petrol station on the motorway. The easiest way to do that is to take bus line G51 from Trieste bus station (around 3 Euro). Bus G51 leaves once every half hour and stops inside the bus station building instead of outside with the other busses. Get out some 30 minutes later after the village of Sistiana in front of the big supermarket \"Conad superstore\" in Duino. Keep walking in the same direction the bus is going for about 400 meters, you\\'ll see a sign saying \"Idea hotel\" and a large fenced in slab of asphalt. Follow the path right here until you reach a small metal gate leading to a gas station on the statal road. The back of this gas station is connected with the rest area on the highway, direction Slovenia. To go direction Venice, just use the underground tunnel connecting the two rest areas. This spot seems to be most active during the morning and early afternoon, but even then there doesn\\'t seem to be too much traffic, and most people were going to Monfalcone 15 minutes up the road. People seemed pretty friendly here, and we managed to get a ride in about 30 minutes. We also tried this spot the previous evening and it was completely desolate apart from a few police cars stopping to get dinner at the \"Fast Eat Italy\".\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\n\\'\\'\\'\\nBus #36 from the center of Trieste. It follows the road along the coast and this road (\\'\\'Viale Miramare\\'\\') is the one leading to the motorway. Get out of the bus at the stop before the last one. There\\'s no ideal spot on this road but if you walk a bit more on this road you can find a couple of acceptable places.  \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nFrom the train station take the bus to the airport (5 euro or more). Get off at the last stop and walk back to the road. You can either wait there on bus stop Begliano at countryside road SS14 or walk 3 km back road SS677 and till Casello Autostradale Di Redipuglia toll\\n\\n== [[Hitchhiking a boat|Ferry]] ==\\n\\nThere is a connection to Durrës, Albania.\\n\\n\\n\\n== [[Sleeping]] ==\\n\\n\\nIf you want to sleep near the see, go near to Miamare castle. There are some flat concrete spots, where you can safely sleep. Keep close to the road so you won\\'t be visible from the road. And be warned: the Carabinieri outpost right above you! Thus  I would not recommend putting a tent, but I found it quite comfortable to sleep just on the inflated mattress there it during the summer. \\n\\n\\nThe other option are hills above Trieste. Take the bus 2  and go near to Obelisco on the top. You can also take a bus 38, but you\\'ll have to walk a little up from the last stop. There is a tap with drinkable water near the Obelisco.  Go to  the Obelisco, you can put a tent behind trees near the Obelisco. Also you may take dirt road that does not go up and you will find some places near the road (with nice view on the bay).\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|Italy}}\\n__NOTOC__\\n\\n[[Category:Italy]]\\n[[Category:E70]]\\n[[Category:E61]]\\n[[Category:Border crossings]]\\n\\n[[de:Triest]]',\n",

Your waiting times will rarely exceed 15 minutes on reasonably used roads, even off the main roads. On smaller roads, the first vehicle passing you is likely to stop for you. Also you\\'re very likely to be invited for tea and food, and often also to home stays. Very few people speak English, while German might be a little bit more useful, especially in the east. However, it\\'s essential to learn at least a few words of basic [[Eastern Europe phrasebook#Turkish|Turkish]], also for your safety. Turkey has a very distinct reputation, especially when it comes to female hitchhikers, but once you get on terms with the dynamics of interacting with Turks (likely only after you make your first mistake, though) you\\'ll usually be fine. See the Safety Chapter below.\\n\\nIt\\'s not very likely that drivers will ask for money, but it happens occasionally. If you feel your status as a free hitchhiker is unclear, make sure to say \\'\\'para(m) yok\\'\\' before you get into the car. On the other hand, this might offend drivers who genuinely want to help you and do not expect money.\\n\\nHitchhiking at night works well as long as you stand in a somewhat visible spot.\\n\\n== Safety ==\\nTurkey has been getting a bad reputation for female hitchhikers following the murder of [[Pippa]] in April 2008 and many discouraging stories, ranging from minor harassment (see Personal Experiences below) to near-miss murder/rape cases like the one [[User:Zenit|Zenit]] and the girl he was travelling with experienced in November 2011. While these things shouldn\\'t deter anybody from travelling in Turkey, they certainly prove that there is a specific code of conduct different from any other country that needs to be respected in order to avoid unnecessary problems. It will take a little bit of travelling in the country first to get used to this different dynamic, so this will be the time to be extra cautious. Further reading for female hitchhikers – and anybody travelling in Turkey – is [http://youarealltourists.blogspot.com/2008/04/hitchhiking-guide-to-turkey-for-girls.html this blog]. Safety is always important while hitchhiking, so check the [[Hitchhiker\\'s safety|Safety]] article before hitting the road!\\n\\nWhat follows is a list of general guidelines for hitchhiking in Turkey. Remember, however, that you cannot fully master the different dynamics of social interaction, especially between members of opposite sexes, until you\\'ve been exposed to the inital special attention you\\'ll receive as a foreigner and possibly made some beginning\\'s mistakes.\\n\\n* First of all, keep in mind that in Turkey there is widespread prejudice concerning the willingness of Western girls to engage in casual sex with random strangers. \\n* Having said that, the biggest part of problems arise from the different conceptions of flirting in the West and in Turkey. In Turkey, making eye conctact, smiling and accepting compliments can all easily be interpreted as outright flirtateous behaviour. Another thing to watch out for is that Turkish men will test males travelling with a female to see how protective they are of their female companion. This will always be in a somewhat playful manner, and hardly ever in a threatening way. One very important thing is that a man travelling with a woman should never let her sit next to a man other than himself. This cannot be stressed enough, as drivers will read from this behaviour that a) the guy has no claims on the girl and don\\'t really care what happens to her from this point and b) that the girl might be interested/easy.\\n* Another important point, if one that goes somewhat without saying, is about clothing. Turkey is definitely not the place to hitchhike in hotpants and a tanktop, the least should be long trousers and a unrevealing t-shirt with sleeves down to your elbows. Anyone wearing less than this (apart from the Western coastal regions maybe) will usually be seen as a prostitute, and without the necessary language skills to explain women\\'s rights over their own body you might get yourself into hassle you don\\'t really need. If you want to be extra safe, you can also hitchhike with a headscarf and/or a long (\"Iranian style\") gown going down to your thighs and hiding your shape.\\n* There is different things you can say about your marital status. If travelling with a guy, the classical story of the married couple can work well enough, but won\\'t necessarily stop a determined guy from trying his chances. Also keep in mind that many truck drivers (but generally not drivers of private cars) know that foreign hitchhikers tend to lie about their status as married couples. This might actually encourage some truck drivers to try his luck even if in the first point they never intended anything at all. If travelling alone as a girl, it seems to be safer to say that you are unmarried - meaning, for most people, a virgin. The purity of virginity is widely respected and can provide protection. You can usefully combine both of these strategies (if travelling in a couple) by saying that you\\'re cousins because a) you will be seen as a unmarried virgin, b) male relatives traditionally protect unmarried female family members and c) a cousin might at some point also have been picked by the family to be a future husband to the girl.\\n* Something that plays into the dynamics of hitchhiking in Turkey as well are the mostly Russian/Eastern European prostitutes that can be found practicing their trade all over Turkey. As a girl hitchhiking, be it alone or in company, you will at some point likely be confused with one of the working ladies. As an effect of many of those girls being Russian, the words \"rus\" or \"natasha\" have come to mean \"foreign prostitute\". If your driver says any of those words, he\\'s most likely asking if you\\'re a prostitute. Make very very clear that you have nothing to do with this, say \\'\\'yok\\'\\' very clearly without hesitating, smiling, laughing, or any other even remotely flirtateous reaction. Be insulted. Likewise it\\'s not a very good idea to say that you\\'re Russian or even from any Eastern European country that could be associated with Russia, especially Ukraine. If the driver has understood that you\\'re not a prostitute, he\\'ll usually not bother you about it any more.\\n* There is one main Turkish hand gesture that leads to confusion among foreigners. It is indeed extremely ambiguous, used in very different situations and complicated to understand in its context. It consists of the index fingers of both hands rubbed against each other back and forth. Some important meanings of it include casual sex, friendship, physical contact, geographical closeness of objects or places, money, etc. You see that the meaning can range from explaining how to get somewhere or explaining that driver is going close to your destination to asking for casual sex. Nothing more can be said than to use your common sense and not to be overly paranoid.\\n* When it comes to accepting rides, listen to your intuition and don\\'t worry about being picky. Remember that even if you say no to several cars you\\'ll still not wait very long.\\n* To finish, a brief list of useful vocabulary in difficult situations. Check out the pronounication guide in the [[Eastern Europe phrasebook#Turkish|Turkish phrasebook]].\\n:* \\'\\'çok ayıp\\'\\' - lit. \"big shame\", the most useful thing to say if somebody is harrassing you (sexual or not.)\\n:* \\'\\'Allah aşkına\\'\\' - lit. \"for Allah\\'s love\", i.e. for God\\'s sake\\n:* \\'\\'kuzen\\'\\' - \"cousin\", \\'\\'biz kuzen\\'\\' - \"we are cousins\"\\n:* \\'\\'evli\\'\\' - \"married\"\\n\\nAs a brief summary: As a girl, be aware of your body language - smiling, eye contact, being flattered by compliments are all bad ideas. As a guy hitchhiking with a girl, stand your ground, show presence; always make sure to sit next to the driver. If the driver talks mostly to the girl, it\\'s a bad sign. Girls should dress modestly and make sure not to be confused with Russian prostitutes (\"rus\", \"natasha\"). Be picky about your rides. Most importantly though, keep in mind that in 99% of the cases all will be fine, especially if you pay attention to those guidelines!\\n\\nAs a guy travelling with a girl it is rare that you will be hit on with the notable exception of the far Eastern part of the country. However travelling alone as a guy you will/might be asked for sex depending not so much on your attractiveness in the Western sense as on how exotic you are (i.e. being big and blond will most likely increase the level of attention). Keep in mind that just even if a guy asks you to have sex with him it does not necessarily mean he\\'s gay. Especially in Eastern Turkey it\\'s very common among unmarried straight men to engage in casual sex among each other as an effect of an extremely conservative society and sometimes horrible ramifications for girls having pre-maritial sex. However other than the nuisance of being asked for sex you\\'re unlikely to run into any problems.\\n\\nPolice and Terrorists\\n\\nFrom 2019 I can account for a great and likely growing suspicion of anyone strange on the road, specifically in Eastern Turkey, where the police are sure there are terrorists everywhere.  Knowing the Kurds having gone through this area and Iraqi Kurdistan before, I doubt more than a fraction of a percent of them, if any, are hostile, however times in turkey are edgy to say the least.  \\n  Do NOT let this stop you, but be advised you might be wayleighed a number of times if hitching through the mountainous regions, especially if you look kürdi, have military gear like mine, or for whatever other reason look suspicious.  \\n  Here are some serious-business police and military forces, and if you\\'re stopped they might just scare the life out of you.  But don\\'t worry.  If you aren\\'t doing anything wrong, the worst you\\'ll get is a proper shakedown and lots of questions.\\n  I have sat next to some of the finest names in terrorism, as well as the finest police and military forces, and they all (they all) offer you tea and treat you well. Stay uninvolved, and never use a term like Kurdistan around the Turks.\\n  Just be aware that the Turks are petrified of the PKK and other groups and might either suspect you OR (and more likely for you more civilian types) insist you take a bus or camp near their checkpoint, citing the dangers of terrorism in the region.\\n  This should be considered a significant headache at times, leading to slowdowns, but no effective trouble in the long run and no reason at all to avoid these areas. \\n  It\\'s just a damn shame when people are pitted against each other and this is the reality in heavily Kurdish regions of Turkey.\\n  Answer their questions, stand your ground about hitching and camping, don\\'t fear the armoured cars and AKs ...and enjoy the tea.\\n\\n== Climate ==\\n\\n[[File:Erzurum.JPG|thumb|250px|In [[winter]] it can be cold.]]\\n\\nDuring the summer temperatures tend to rise above 35&nbsp;°C, especially in the South, so it is recommended to secure yourself with sufficient supplies of water, and to plan travelling in a way that most of the actual hitchhiking would be earlier in the morning or in very late afternoon, to avoid a burning sun.\\n\\nIn [[winter]], though, it can be quite cold in Turkey. \\n\\nAs long as you stick to the south coast, you\\'ll be able to have a swim in the Aegean any sunny winter day. On some places it\\'s just hitching 100km north into the mountains and you\\'ll see snow too!\\n\\n=== Hitchhiking buses ===\\n\\n[[File:Mikeeg555 hitching in Turkey.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[User:Mikeeg555|Mikeeg555]] hitching in Turkey]]\\nWhile waiting beside the road, town-to-town minibus drivers (which can be recognized by banners proclaiming town names all over) and intercity buses will flash their headlights or honk at you — to ask whether you\\'d like a ride (for a fee, of course). Don\\'t be afraid to stop them and say \"\\'\\'Param yok\\'\\' (which literally translates \"I don\\'t have money\"), it\\'s ok?\". A couple of hitchhikers did this when a bus stopped beside them to drop a passenger, and then they kept doing this everytime, and about 30% of the buses gave them a ride. [[User:Sirrdc|Sirrdc]] also had great success hitchhiking on intercity buses. Inside the cities, it\\'s even easier; ask them politely and they will take you a bit further ahead.\\n\\n[[File:turkeyhitch.jpg|thumb|350px|[[User:Chael777|Chael]]<small><sup>[http://www.velabas.com/ site]</sup></small> hitching south to Bodrum, April 2008]]\\n\\n== Regions and Their Hitchability ==\\nWhile in general it is fairly easy to attract a lift in Turkey, locals\\' view of hitchhikers vary across the country. In general, people in northern and inland regions of the country are friendlier towards hitchhikers. If put systematically, the level of ease to get a lift in various regions of the country is as follows in general, from easiest to hardest:\\n\\n:Southeastern Anatolia (usually the first car passing by offering a lift) > North coast (Black Sea Region) (one in every ten cars offering a lift) > Northwest/European Turkey (Thrace) (most waits not exceeding 5 mins) > Inland steppes (Central Anatolia, longest waits likely ~20 mins) > Northwest/Asian Marmara (South Marmara) > Aegean Region > Southwest coast (Lycia) > Rest of Mediterranean coast (expect waits up to two hours!), with eastern mountains (Eastern Anatolia) perhaps falling somewhere between Central Anatolia and South Marmara.\\n\\nAs can be clearly seen, less touristy somewhere is, easier to attract a lift there. That being said, however, there are of course helpful drivers on the highways of the south, too, although they seem to be exceptions rather than the rule.\\n\\n* [[:Category:Antalya (Province)|Antalya Province]]\\n* [[:Category:Çanakkale (Province)|Çanakkale Province]]\\n* [[Cappadocia]] \\n* [[:Category:Muğla (Province)|Muğla Province]]\\n* [[:Category:Southeastern Anatolia|Southeastern Anatolia]] \\n\\n== Personal Experiences ==\\n\\n\\'\\'- Some recent thoughts and reflections about hitchhiking Turkey as a solo female at [https://anaimlesshitchhiker.com/2013/01/04/an-update-about-hitchhiking-solo-as-a-female-in-turkey/ an aimless hitchhiker]\\'\\'\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'- 2020 february i hitchiked from Batumi border to Istanbul and 1200 km i did in 2.5 days (with sleeping in nights). Just stick to main highways and make text with big city 300 km away. On the paid highway i got ride in 5 minutes.. Also i seen alot of local youth hitchiking around\\'\\'\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'- Hitchhiking out was really a hassle. It is easy to get a lift, but people do not understand that you need to follow the highway. They think you want to take a bus, and thus it gets complicated. In other parts of Turkey I had a recorded message by Turkish friends explaining what I was actually doing and what I needed from drivers. I didn\\'t have it when leaving IST, and it was a mistake. Get a Turkish friend to record a message on your phone which you can play to the drivers who give you a lift. It should say something like: \"I\\'m from COUNTRY, and right now I\\'m hitchhiking from PLACE to PLACE. Can you help me with ride please??\"\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'- 2 times I hitchhiked from Istanbul to Asia and once back to Europe. I didn´t have any map of the city and I haven´t use any bus because hitchhiking from Istanbul is very easy. There are a lot of cars and turkish drivers will not let you wait. If you are goning to Asia and you´re still in european part so the best spot is probably on the start of Bosphorus bridge. To get out from Istanbul you always need to take more cars(about 3-5 cars). In this city you can use hitchhiking as a public transport, just raise you´re tumb and there is a big chance that you´ll come forexample to city center faster than by metro.\\'\\'\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'- My friend and I (both female) hitched through Turkey from the Greek border to Cappadocia and it was quite stressful. We  never waited long for a ride and most of the people we rode with insisted on buying us chai (just tea) and meals. However, I would say that with about 90 percent of our rides we got our butts, boobs, or crotches grabbed, or at least asked for sex.  We had to make our driver leave us on the side of the road a lot in the middle of nowhere so that was kinda dangerous. And it took us about 10 hours to make it 25 miles from just before Istanbul to just past the city. People kept trying to take us into the city or someplace we didn\\'t want to go. We were so glad when we finally made it out of Turkey at the Bulgarian border. It was an adventure though and I would recommend traveling through Turkey, just be aware that all of the other women standing on the side of the road are prostitutes.  It was all just a giant misunderstanding and a lack of respect, to some extent, on our part, for the local culture. When hitching here maybe you can learn how to say \"we are just traveling and we aren\\'t looking for sex may we still have a ride\" before getting in a vehicle. For the record, our drivers always let us out when we told them too and nothing dramatic happened beyond the daily grabbings.\\'\\'\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'- I have just finished my second two-week trip alone through Turkey just hitchhiking, and my experience has not been at all like the above. I was quite shocked when I read it! I was traveling for long distances almost every day and I must have hitched with over fifty drivers – and only one of those drivers touched me apart from to shake my hand, and I was asked for sex twice, relatively politely, and both accepted no as an answer. I was treated with courtesy, respect, generosity, kindness, invites home to meet their families, and yes, tea and oranges. Also people kept buying me bus tickets rather than \\'letting\\' me hitchhike on, which was horribly embarrassing! I think people who picked me up probably did consider that I might be a prostitute, but easily accepted that I wasn\\'t judging on behavior. I suspect that experiences like the above depend on inappropriate behaviour or dress, or horribly bad luck. I don\\'t speak Turkish, so sometimes it was a bit boring, which was probably the worst thing about hitchhiking. I would recommend not understanding the questions about whether you\\'re alone or married- not speaking Turkish can actually help! And also be aware that Turkish women hitchhiking sit in the back seat of cars, same as in taxis.\\'\\'\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'- I hitch-hiked with a male friend for 3.5 weeks in Turkey. We started from Istanbul, to Safranbolu, Yozgat, Malatya, Nemrut Daig, Cappadocia, Kalkan and back to Istanbul. I was asked to have sex with the bus conductor after one of the bus conductor invited us to take us and he found out that my friend and I are just friends traveling together.  Well, that\\'s just a minor issue. We got picked up by an old man when we were hitch-hiking from Cappadocia to Nemrut Dagi. The old man had only 2 fingers on his right hand, and he was driving at the speed of 150\\xa0km/h, drinking tea and talking over the phone while my friend and I were sitting at the back! He drove us to a town nearby to do some sight-seeing and invited us to stay with his daughter\\'s family! We ended up staying there for 3 nights. My fiend joined her husband to work while i stayed at home with the wife doing some traditional stuff! The hardest route to get a ride was probably from Antalya to Kalkan. It was late and no one wanted to pick us up! In the end, two guys who worked in a restaurant picked us up and sent us to our friend\\'s doorstep!\\'\\'\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'- Summer 2012 we spent hitch-hiking around Turkey. Me (male) and my girlfriend have experienced a lot of hospitality from Turkish drivers and hosts. Many times they stopped on the road and they offered us lunch/dinner. Turkish men never hardly spoke to my girlfriend (they fully respect fact that woman is in relationship with other man). Once whilst hitch-hiking the bus pull-over. We explained that we don\\'t have money for payment - it was any problem. Another fantastic thing about hhiking in Turkey is you rarely have to wait more than 10 minutes, drivers pull-over their car on the highway and sometimes you just have to walk alongside the road and they will stop the car. Great experience, but I really recommend to go there as a mixed pair!\\'\\'\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'- A female friend and I hitchhiked from the Georgian border to Istanbul. Turkey is one of the easiest countries in the world to hitch rides. Wait times, even in bad locations, rarely exceed ten minutes. The hitchhiking is so good that it pays to be picky about who you ride with: in Turkey you will have the privilege to turn down truck drivers in favor of faster vehicles. Although slower, most trucks will stop to offer rides. While hitchhiking at night, we were allowed to nap in the sleeping berths that long-haul trucks have. Be polite, respectful, and learn a few words of Turkish and you will have great experiences (free food, impromptu tour guides, beds to sleep in, etc.). However, you should be cautious if you are a solo female traveler, as even mild friendliness towards unrelated males will be misconstrued as flirtation.\\'\\'\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'- Hitchhiked along the Black Sea Coast from Georgia to Bulgaria. Turkey was easy enough for me even for such a huge country. There was no issue sleeping on beaches or sleeping in fields on the outskirts of towns (I always asked for permission off of security guards etc. which most private property had). The cities are really big though due to the big populations, walking out of them can take ages, especially Istanbul which is very difficult to hitchhike out of. Turks are super proud too for the most part so don\\'t offend them and also don\\'t urinate on the side of the road unless you are certain no-one will see (its definitely not acceptable)\\'\\'\\n\\n== Links ==\\n* [https://www.facebook.com/groups/otostopRail/ Turkish hitchhikers FB group]\\n* [http://youarealltourists.blogspot.com/2008/04/hitchhiking-guide-to-turkey-for-girls.html Hitchhiking Guide to Turkey for girls]\\n* [http://abgefahren.hitchbase.com/DE/blogs/alex/20090213/just-hitching-rides-journey-eid-christmas Just hitching rides: A journey from Eid to Christmas] (Hitchhiking from Yemen to Germany), abgefahren Blogs\\n* User [[User:Halt, Stop!

It\\'s best that you ask someone where that is. When you get on that road, the best thing you can do is grab a minibus up to the end of the road, since it\\'s a pretty long and boring walk. Just find a bus station and get on any minibus/bus going to \\'\\'Combinat\\'\\'. One trip costs 2 Romanian Lei, and you can buy a ticket from the driver.  The minibuses going to Auchan are free and they go in every hour from different parts of the city. Get off at the last stop, near the Auchan hypermarket. That\\'s the spot. If it\\'s really crowded, you can try walking back a bit, to the Petrom petrol station, or a bit more, to the bus stop just before Petrom. Either works fine. \\n\\nHowever, it is not compulsory to go to the end of the town, many hitchhikers will stand near the bus stop between the train station (Piata Garii / Gara CFR) and the OMV petrol station, former Frigoriferul bus stop. This option saves you the time and efort of getting to the Metro/Auchan mentioned above, but limits the number of cars that might pick you up since many drivers, especially truckers, coming from elsewhere will avoid the city centre and will join this main road at a later junction.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Sighişoara]], [[Braşov]] {{European Route Number|60}} ===\\n\\nTake a bus (number 20/17/43/12 depending on where you are) for Tudor neighbourhood, preferably one that goes to Tudor/Centrofarm/Masini de Calcul via \"Corina\" and not \"Cutezantei\". You can buy a ticket either from the driver or from a person sitting at the middle of the bus (\"taxator\"), depending on the line. After a large crossroads with traffic lights there is a stop where many people will get off, this is \"Fortuna\", you don\\'t get off here but at the next one, after the bus turns left at a roundabout (this is \"Corina\"). Walk back to the main road and continue in the direction the bus was going before it turned left, find a pedestrian crossing and cross to the right side of the road. You might have to walk back a few steps and that is the spot: you are likely to notice other hitchhikers standing somewhere between the roundabout and the pedestrian crossing.\\nSome people might choose the junction half a mile to the south, because more cars pass by that place, but it is more dangerous and you might have to share the place with prostitutes. So I\\'d go for the spot near the roundabout.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Reghin]], [[Bistrita]], [[Gheorgheni]] (N15) ===\\n\\nThe best spot is near the bus stop in Republicii square (\\'\\'Piata Republicii\\'\\').

If you go north next is \"Wunnenstein\" near exit Ilsfeld, if you go to Ulm/Munich it is \"Gruibingen\" near exit Aichelberg. As many cars also go to Stuttgart it is rather hard to find the proper car in Tübingen.\\nA good option is to change cars at the airport. Nearly all cars on B27 pass by the airport. Go to departures where you will find your car soon. It generally takes us not more than 30min. This hub also works perfectly when arriving back to Tübingen.\\n\\nGetting out of Tübingen it is also possible to stand on Stuttgarter Str. at the intersection with Wilhelmstr. and Pfrondorfer Str. in the north of the town. There is an extra lane here for cars to pull over, gives the opportunity to attract cars from the traffic flow rather than just asking at a garage.

Can we [[help Ukrainian refugees]]\\'\\'?\\n\\'\\'\\'Ukraine\\'\\'\\' is one of the biggest countries in [[Europe]]. It borders [[Moldavia]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]] and the Black Sea.\\n\\nIt has been at war with Russia since 2014 and since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, a large part of the country remains under military occupation. However, traveling to the country is still possible and can be a valuable experience. Some safety measures are described below.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking ==\\n\\nUkrainians understand the concept of hitchhiking very well, although it seems to have become more difficult since the war with Russia began in 2014. \\n\\nThere are significant regional differences, as in the countryside many people still regularly travel between villages. In recent years, the expectation to share the fuel costs has become more rare, however it is still useful to let your driver know that you are an international hitchhiker and traveling for free. Like other European countries, truck drivers always recognize hitchhikers and know they are travelling for free. \\n\\nYou can hitchhike anywhere along the roadside, even on real motorway like the [[Kyiv]]-[[Odessa]] road. The first two letters of the Ukrainian number plates indicate the region which can be helpful for finding a ride in the right direction. \\n\\n[[File:Ukrainian_number_plates.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A map showing the regional Ukrainian number plates]]\\n\\nThe state of the roads is pretty dire in general, and the distances involved are usually pretty big (for example [[Lviv]] to [[Kyiv]] is around 550 km, 8 hours of driving). Getting an early start is essential. \\n\\n== Language ==\\n\\nThe biggest problem you could encounter is that few people speak English or other foreign languages. Polish is widely understood. \\n\\nSince the beginning of the full-scale invasion, many Ukrainians have shifted away from speaking Russian. Especially in the West, you might get unpleasant reactions when speaking Russian. \\n\\nDialects or Surzhyk (a mixed form of Ukrainian and Russian) are common.\\n\\nWhen the language barrier is overcome, Ukrainians are generally hospitable and open people.\\n\\n== Safety ==\\n\\n=== Air Raid Alerts ===\\n\\nAs Ukraine suffers missile and drone attacks regularly, it is paramount to recognize alerts and seek shelter immediately.\\n\\nSiren sounds differ from region to region and might not always be available at all. Many Ukrainians have alerts set up on their phone through apps ([https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ukrainealarm&hl=en Android], [https://apps.apple.com/ua/app/%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%96%D1%82%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B0/id1611955391?l=uk iOS]) and as long as you are in a crowd, you will hear the sound go off on phones around you. In addition, various Telegram channels and some websites offer more information about the type of attack and allow people to react accordingly.\\n\\nMost of the attacks happen at night. If you hear a siren at night, it is important to assess the situation and determine whether or not you need to seek shelter.\\n\\n=== Shelter ===\\n\\nShelters are marked as \"укриття\" (\"ukryttya\" – Ukrainian) or \"убежище\" (\"ubezhyzhzhye\" –\\xa0Russian, in the East). Some cities offer maps of the shelters available to the public.\\n\\nUsually marked with graffiti on the walls or floor, most shelters are situated in the basements of public or residential buildings. There are also suitable alternatives such as metro stations, underpasses or underground supermarkets available. In the East, many cities equipped public transport stations with mobile concrete shelters that are quite small but will still save your life in an emergency.\\n\\nDo not let the locals\\' behavior misguide you. Many people will ignore the siren because it is their daily life. As a visitor, you do not have the experience to make such a judgement for yourself.\\n\\n=== Telegram Channels ===\\n\\n* [https://t.me/kpszsu Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (Official Military Information)]\\n* [https://t.me/UkraineAlarmSignal єТривога – Volunteers monitoring and reporting alarms and other threats (usually quickest)]\\n* [https://t.me/KyivCityOfficial Kyiv City Channel – PSAs from the mayor, city council and administration in Kyiv]\\n* [https://t.me/war_monitor monitor – Updates and alerts about the war with more technical focus]\\n\\n== Climate and Weather == \\n\\nIn winter Ukraine can get very cold, for example in January 2006, it hit −35&nbsp;°C, which makes hitchhiking very dangerous. The cost of train travel is very cheap – usually around one Euro for every 100 km (for overnight sleeping carriages), so bear that in mind when going from city to city.\\n\\nIt might be hot in summer (up to +35&nbsp;°C), so don\\'t forget to take a hat with you to protect yourself from lots of sunbathing. \\n\\nAreas like the Crimean peninsula (which you can now only access via Russia as a foreigner) can be quite uncomfortable to hitch during the summer due to the heat.\\n\\n== Public Transport ==\\n\\n=== Train ===\\n\\nUkrzaliznycia is the state rail transport company. It is beloved by most Ukrainians and for good reason – low prices, good availability and almost every train is a sleeping carriage. With their new website and app, booking a ticket is easily done online. Bed sheets are optional (80 UAH) but should be booked out of respect unless you plan to sit for the entire duration.\\n\\nIf you want to enter Ukraine without a car, you would usually do so by train through Przemyśl. It is significantly faster by train than by car.\\n\\n=== Marschrutka ===\\n\\nMarschrutkas are widely available in Ukraine and will stop anywhere. These are quite affordable even on longer routes (ca. 3 €\\xa0/ 100km).\\n\\nEvery city and village will have a line running through them, but it can be hard to find out when or where they go. Do not hesitate to ask the locals or going to the ticket counter. Google Translate will be your friend. Otherwise, they are comparable to the Turkish \"Dolmuş,\" as you can stop them anywhere on their route and pay your ride in cash. \\n\\nOftentimes, when no train is available, a short Marschrutka will be your cheapest and quickest way to travel.\\n\\n== Food ==\\n\\nOf course you can get stuck easily on the motorway next to a turn-off from the main road because of nightfall. But there is also nice night-traffic of trucks caused by warm weather from May to September. Usually, there are some gas stations near to such places and there some favorite and famous places for stops known by drivers – something like unofficial rest-stations (there are no official but a lot of unofficial ones). You can easily find something to eat and to drink there and at almost all gas stations there are 24 hour shops. You can eat in some restaurants on the road, which are significantly cheaper than in the EU - a nice meal for around $5, or a baguette and cheese for much less.\\n\\nPuzata Hata is a good place to eat quick and cheap. A full meal will rarely cost you more than 5 euros and usually consist of quite traditional food. Ukrainians will sometimes call it the \"Ukrainian McDonalds\" but this doesn\\'t do the place justice – the food is really good and nutritious!\\n\\n== Crime ==\\n\\nCrimes related to hitch-hiking are not common in Ukraine. But a hitchhiker should avoid cars with drunken drivers or passengers. When you are a single girl it\\'s better to find truck or a car with family for your safety. Avoid night rides with “funny” drivers. Keep your money (carry a bank card instead of a lot of cash) and phone in a safe place.\\n\\n== Personal Experiences ==\\n\\nI hitchhiked from Khust to Ivano-Frankivsk in just two rides in August, 2024 (as well as between some villages). It is advisable to speak a fairly good level of Ukrainian, but doesn\\'t seem necessary at all. Drivers were quite nice, but women will not stop for single men. People seemed to know exactly where I wanted to go, what I was doing and had a good attitude. In the Carpathians, there are many military checkpoints which might discourage people from picking up men, in my case, usually soldiers would stop and take me across. – [[User:Rebew|Rebew]] ([[User talk:Rebew|talk]]) 14:56, 2 September 2024 (CEST)\\n\\n== Regions and Cities ==\\n\\n* [[Kyiv]]\\n* [[Lviv]]\\n* [[Kharkiv]]\\n* [[Odessa|Odesa]]\\n* [[Izmail]]\\n* [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]]\\n\\n* Zakarpattia Oblast\\n** [[Uzhgorod|Uzhhorod]]\\n** [[Khust]]\\n** [[Mukachevo]]\\n\\n* Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast\\n** [[Ivano-Frankivsk]]\\n\\n=== Under occupation ===\\n\\nThe following regions and cities are under military occupation by the russian federation and aren\\'t adequate for touristic travel.\\n\\n* Donezk Oblast\\n** [[Kramatorsk]]\\n* Kherson Oblast\\n* Luhansk Oblast\\n* Zaporizhzhia Oblast\\n* Kharkiv Oblast (partially occupied, still highly dangerous)\\n* Autonomous Republic of Crimea (fully occupied and unable to travel from Ukraine)\\n** [[Simferopol]]\\n\\nA current map of war updates is available at [https://liveuamap.com/ liveuamap.com].\\n\\n== Border crossing ==\\n\\n* [[Belarus]]\\n** [[Skytok-Novaja Huta border crossing|Skytok-Novaja Huta]]\\n* [[Hungary]]\\n** [[Chop-Záhony border crossing|Chop-Záhony]]\\n* [[Poland]]\\n** [[Dorohusk-Jahodin border crossing|Dorohusk-Jahodin]]\\n** [[Dołhobyczów-Uhryniv border crossing]]\\n** [[Hrebenne-Rava Ruska border crossing|Hrebenne-Rava Ruska]]\\n** [[Korczowa-Krakovets border crossing|Korczowa-Krakovets]]\\n** [[Shegyni-Medyka border crossing|Shegyni-Medyka]]  \\n* [[Romania]]\\n** [[Dyakove-Halmeu border crossing|Dyakove-Halmeu]]\\n** [[Sighetu Marmației-Solotvyno border crossing|Sighetu Marmației-Solotvyno]]\\n** [[Siret-Porubnoe border crossing|Siret-Porubnoe]]\\n* [[Slovakia]]\\n** [[Vyšné Nemecké-Uzhhorod border crossing]]\\n** [[Ubľa-Malyi Bereznyi border crossing]]\\n** [[Velké Slemence-Mali Selmenci border crossing]] (pedestrian crossing, EU/EEA & Ukrainian passports only)\\n\\n== Further Information ==\\n\\n* [http://ua_autostop.livejournal.com Ukrainian hitchhiking community] {{ru}}, but you can ask questions and get replies in {{en}}\\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=IE-WQ3rvmW4 Short video summary of the Ukrainian World Championship qualifiers in 2012] giving an idea of the roads travellers will encounter there.\\n* [http://www.eway.in.ua/ua/ Public transport in Ukraine]\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n{{Template:Europe/countries}} \\n__NOTOC__\\n\\n[[Category:Ukraine| ]]\\n\\n[[de:Ukraine]]\\n[[es:Ucrania]]\\n[[fr:Ukraine]]\\n[[ru:Украина]]\\n[[uk:Україна]]',\n",

Wide road and lit up during night. \\n\\nHowever, GPS apps will tell drivers to use the other road around the city. You definitely can't trust the satellite pictures, as they will show you trees and fields where roads are now going trough. (july 2022) Use google street view as it is way more often updated. The actual best spot to get out of the city and head nort is the bus stop just before the OKQ8 gaz station. This is the last gaz station before exiting the city by this road. If someone offers you a short drive out of the city, ask if he can get you to Bygdeå's gaz station. This is a perfect hitchhiking spot. The trafic here is very slow and the entrance to the gaz service area makes it perfect to hitch on the side of the highway. You should be able to reach Skellefteå quickly, from there. A bus can get you there from Umeå, apparently. Be advised, tho, that it is remote and you won't be able to to get a lift when it's dark. There's plently of woods all around and even a camping right next to the spot, so you have places to sleep.\\n\\n=== North West towards [[Bodø]] ===\\nE12 to Mo I Rana is well traveled. \\n\\nHowever most truckers and people that make the entire trip often take 95 as it is a shorter distance. There is perhaps less traffic on this highway but your chances of getting a longer ride are much greater. If you are going to take this route to the north of Norway from Umeå hitch up to Skellefteå where 95 heads out west across the mountains. Beware that traffic on 95 slows considerably during the winter months, and '''heavy snows can shut down the pass''' to extend this one day trip into two or more.\\n\\n\\n=== South towards [[Sundsvall]], [[Uppsala]] or [[Stockholm]] ===\\nThere is a petrol station next to the E4 in ''Tankvägen'', about 500 metres south of the bridge ''Tegsbron''. You can ask for people going south on the E4 there.\\nIn winter there is not much traffic on this petrol station, and the cars that were using it were mostly going back to Umeå again. To avoid this traffic, walk a little further to where the road splits in two and start hitchhiking from there. This is a good place as you can also stick your left thumb up to people going to the highway without using the petrol station.\\nNote that waiting times can be very long here, and do not accept rides that will take you only a few kilometres if you want to go long-distance.\\n\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n{{IsIn|Västerbottens län}}\\n\\n{{Category|City's}}\\n[[Category:E4]]\\n[[Category:Sweden]]\\n[[Category:E12]]\",\n",

It\\'s only the countries mentioned on the [http://www.rop.gov.om/english/dg_passport_visa_dubai.asp Royal Oman Police - Directorates - Passport &amp; Residence] website site that are benefiting from this. What that website does not mention though, is that this is \\'\\'\\'only\\'\\'\\' possible if you go through the [[Hatta]] border.

I waited for hours and eventually some Indian people picked me up twice and later local person, who explained me why hitchhiking is difficult here.\\nActually hitchhiking is illegal now in UAE, because:\\n# Driver can\\'t stop on the road, it\\'s prohibited and he will pay fine.\\n# Driver can\\'t drive strangers in his car. The fine for stranger in the car is about 700 USD.\\n# If police will find drugs with some of car passengers, every person in this car will be equally guilty.\\n\\n\\n===[[WildWill]]===\\nI grew up in Dubai and love it for its culture (which might surprise you). It\\'s a mix of all the worlds cultures with an overall Arabian feel... and with history. Outside the city, there is pure Arabia to explore and I wish I could take you to all of it. \\nHitchhiking is super easy once out of the city, to the extent that I choose which cars to hitchhike. I will say that if you came this far, you must go to Oman as well - it\\'s what you\\'ve come to see (and be sure to go all the way to Salalah).\\n\\nMy recommendations:\\n*In Dubai, go to the Creek (Al Ras metro stop), this is where Dubai started as a port town. The traditional wooden dhows coming from Iran, Kuwait, India and Somalia still line the quayside. Definitely a cultural experience! Find the Spice Souk and breathe in the frankincense and spices. The Gold Souk nearby is worthwhile to see such a heap of gold in one place, then take an Abra (\"Open\" boat) across the Creek (1 Dirham/$0.27). Find an Indian restaurant hidden in an alley and get some cheap food (shawarma!! or biriyani etc) and a fruit smoothie or chai (also 1dhs). \\n\\n*The Hajar Mountains in the east are full of oases (wadi), ask your drivers for a good wadi to camp/swim in. Some wadis are dry and barren, some are lush Edens.\\n\\n*In the very north is an enclave of Oman called Musandam. This is one of my favourite places on Earth, an unknown gem of Arabian fjords. Get to Khasab and pay for a dhow cruise (~150 Dhs, w/ lunch), that will take you into the fjords. You always see dolphins, and they\\'ll probably ride the bow wave. The fjords are peaceful and you\\'ll stop for a swim.\\n\\n*3 hours south of Dubai is the epic desert of Liwa, near the Saudi border and the start of the Empty Quarter [closer to Dubai, the desert of Badayer is beautiful]. Huge dunes. Bring water. It\\'s quite quiet but even just a drive through here will be a lasting memory. Hopefully you\\'ll find someone to take you off-road. If this tickles your fancy, the Wahiba Sands in Oman are also epic, and more cultural. Make your way to Falaj Al Mashayikh, NW of Jalan Bani Bu Hassan. This is a Bedouin village and any ride here will likely result in you being welcomed to their Majalis, and inshallah, a desert drive too. Wadi Bani Khalid starting ~30km N of here is another gem, follow the road through the mountain oasis.\\n\\nUpdate: I see others are curious about the ferry from Bandar Abbas to Sharjah. I took this route completing my journey from the UK to the UAE. Originally I wanted to hitchhike a dhow, but the port I went to had security gates preventing me from reaching the dhows (Bandar Lengeh - \"Dhow Port\"!) [this isn\\'t the case in Dubai or Sharjah]. I could have persevered by trying another port, but with home so close and the ferry leaving that day, I took it. I didn\\'t have enough cash left for the ticket, so they agreed to take my passport as collateral and in Sharjah the friendly police escorted me to the ATM, I bought back my passport from the captain and they fast tracked me through security. \\nFerry took 13 hours, through the night. Not much to report except that it is possible. I don\\'t know how reliable the schedule is. \\nPS. Iran is an incredible country, the friendliest I\\'ve been to. Please see for yourself :)\\n\\n===[[User:Alex|alex]]:===\\n*I have no experiences with hitchhiking long distances in the UAE as I got a lift directly from somewhere in Oman to Dubai. However, it seemed to me that there are enough half empty cars and people that drive for fun. In Dubai itself I did get some rides from Asian foreigners when I tried to get rides at traffic lights, however, in quite some cases I left cars quite often again at the next traffic light as they suddenly seemed to function as a taxi. North of Dubai in Sharjah leaves the ferry to Bandar Abbas, Iran. I am curious if somebody has experiences in hitchhiking a boat there.\\n\\n===Felix===\\n*I hitchhiked from Dubai to Muscat, Oman and some days later back to Dubai Airport. It was very easy to get back to Dubai, but leaving Dubai was quite hard. After spending hours in Dubai I took a cab into the desert (for about 10 US$) and then tried hitchhiking along the highway towards Oman. Most people that stopped wanted some money and all those who did not want money dropped me off at the next bus station. In Oman it was easier, but I was still dropped off at bus stations all the time. I got my entire three day stay organized by some people that gave me rides and they offered me everything from food, place to sleep and tourist tours. Hitchhiking in Oman is the best way to meet locals.\\n*I\\'m also curious if somebody made it with the ferry from [[Iran]] to Sharjah (or the other way around). I tried it, but the ferry was almost a week delayed (and twice as expensive for Europeans), so I had to fly to Dubai since my Iranian visa was about to expire.\\n\\n===[[User:Jakobwithk|Jakobwithk]]===\\n*In January 2012 I spent about a week in [[Dubai]] before I hitched into [[Oman]]. I successfully managed to hitchhike inside the city. Especially the people from India and Pakistan was very happy to help me. The big E11 highway inside Dubai city would be insane to try and hitchhike on though, unless you find a good on-ramp. Combining the (quite cheap) metro and hitchhiking worked pretty well in the city. I also found it very easy to hitchhike to [[Oman]], I never waited more than 10 minutes, usually one of the first cars passing by picked me up. Only 1 guy asked how much I would pay. But as Felix writes, you might want to get a taxi out of the city center. I stayed with a host outside the center, so I managed without a taxi. --[[User:Jakobwithk|Jakobwithk]] 10:12, 16 January 2012 (CET)\\n\\n== Emirates ==\\n*[[Abu Dhabi (emirate)]]\\n*[[Ajman]]\\n*[[Dubai]]\\n*[[Fujairah]]\\n*[[Ras al-Khaimah]]\\n*[[Sharjah]]\\n*[[Umm al-Quwain]]\\n\\n== Cities ==\\n*[[Abu Dhabi (city)]]\\n*[[Al Ain]]\\n*[[Dibba]]\\n*[[Dubai]]\\n*[[Kalba]]\\n*[[Sila]]\\n\\n{{stub}}\\n\\n== Links ==\\n* [http://abgefahren.hitchbase.com/DE/blogs/alex/20090213/just-hitching-rides-a-journey-eid-christmas Just hitching rides: A journey from Eid to Christmas], abgefahren Blogs (article partly based on)\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n[[Category:Western Asia]]\\n[[Category:Middle East]]\\n[[Category:East Route from North Cape to Cape of Good Hope]]',\n",

For the convenience of the common hitchhiker, these states are discussed in detail along with their capitals in their individual pages (see below).  The US is bordered by [[Canada]] to the north and [[Mexico]] to the south. \\n\\nHitching, like everything else in America, varies greatly depending on what type of area and what part of the country you are passing through. In general you can get rides fairly easily if you hitchhike the right way; in fact, often you can find more than just rides, such as offers for free meals, invitations to homes and parties, etc. \\n\\n__TOC__\\n\\n== Culture ==\\n\\nMany Americans have a limited worldview.  (I can say this because I am one.)  We think there are two places in the world: America and other places.  Don\\'t waste your time explaining that \"American\" is an incorrect demonym.  And get used to our senseless system of measurement.  It\\'s a part of our culture.\\n\\nDespite a large number of immigrants all across the country, most Americans are still curious about people from different parts of the world, fascinated by foreign accents, and eager to introduce visitors to American culture. Despite an undercurrent of xenophobia and racism in rural parts of the country, Americans tend to have a pragmatic view towards foreigners: Americans might profoundly dislike your country of origin, but they will rarely hold that against you as an individual.\\n\\nRelative to other Western countries, people in the rural United States are profoundly religious.  People who pick you up might inquire about your religion. If you\\'re not religious, try to deal with it in a positive way and accept the difference. Despite a level of religious intolerance much higher than in Europe, Americans tend to have a pragmatic approach to people of unfamiliar religious backgrounds: Americans tend not to judge you badly even if they might be suspicious of your religion.\\n\\nMore often you will be picked up by really cool people, and often dropped off exactly at the point of your destination, as hitchhiker [[User:Guaka|Guaka]]\\'s experience shows, for example. \\n\\n=== Cars ===\\n\\'\\'Driving in the United States is similar to driving in Canada, but very different from driving in Europe. It is not uncommon for Americans to drive more than an hour each way to work, and 77 percent of Americans drive alone to their jobs... Most states allow people to drive unaccompanied once they have reached the age of 16.\\'\\'  -[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_in_the_United_States Wikipedia: Driving in the United States]\\n\\nThere are more than 250 million registered vehicles in the USA, the most of any country.  Everyone has a car, and gas is so cheap that people drive everywhere.  As a result there are a lot of roads and highways.  Sometimes you may need to change your technique to accommodate unfamiliar infrastructure.  Sometimes it can be hard to find a place with slow traffic!  Although traffic is heavy, hitchhiking is also hard because nobody trusts somebody with no car.  (Why don\\'t you have a car?  There must be something wrong with you.)  It would help to look like a foreigner, but don\\'t go so far as to wave a foreign flag around.  Hitchhiking is not as common as in Europe and Latin America, so expect to have to explain yourself, possibly to the police.  (See the section on police below).\\n\\n== Transportation system ==\\n\\n=== Interstates ===\\n[[File:2006-interstate-map.png|right|A map of the interstate system in 2006.  ]]\\nAn \\'interstate\\', also known as an \\'\\'\\'expressway\\'\\'\\', \\'\\'\\'freeway\\'\\'\\', or (confusingly) \\'\\'\\'highway\\'\\'\\', is a large, multilane road that covers vast distances, and passes through major cities.  If you aren\\'t planning on going to the countryside, you probably won\\'t need to stray far from the interstate system.  \\n\\nInterstates are designated on maps by \"I-...\" and have road signs [http://hitchwiki.org/en/File:InterstateSign.svg#file like this].  Even-numbered routes run from west to east and are numbered from south to north.  For example, [[I-10]] runs across the south from [[L.A.]] to [[Jacksonville, FL]], and I-90 across the North from [[Seattle]] to [[Boston]].  Likewise, odd-numbered expressways start with [[I-5]] along the west coast (Seattle to L.A.) and I-95 along the east coast ([[Maine]] to [[Miami]]).  \\n\\nThe main interstates have two or three numbers, as in I-8 or I-76.  Offshoots or ring roads will have a preceeding digit, for example, I-295, which runs along I-95.\\n\\n\\n== Methods for catching rides ==\\nIf you\\'re going for speed over a long distance (3+ hours), then the best bet is to stay on the interstates.  Highways are better for shorter or more senic trips.  \\n\\n=== Interstates ===\\n\\'\\'\\'Thumbing it on on-ramps\\'\\'\\' is sometimes the best way to hitchhike the interstates.  Standing along the shoulder with a thumb or sign can take a few hours so bring something to read.  Try to stick to exits that large towns, truck stops, [[rest area|rest stops]] or any other reason for drivers to stop there (restaurants, [[petrol station hitchhiking|gas stations]], hotels, etc.).  Ask a driver to drop you off at on on-ramp with plenty of traffic.  \\n\\nFor this same reason, be prepared to turn down a ride with someone who\\'s \"just going to the next exit\".  Getting dropped off on a low-traffic exit is the gravest danger when hitching on interstates.  It can easily lead to long, long delays of a car every ten minutes and none of them stopping.  Eventually you may give up and stand on the highway or walk a few miles to the next exit.  Since pedestrians are not allowed along interstates in most states, you are likely to be picked up by a state trooper.  In the best case, your ID will be check and you may will be given a lift to the next exit.  See the section on police.  \\n\\nWhen making \\'\\'\\'signs\\'\\'\\' in the states, it best to use the two-letter state abbreviations, which are universally understood, notable exceptions being OK, HI, and LA.  The first two could be confused for words, the last ([[Louisiana]]) could be confused with ([[Los Angeles]]).  Additionally: \\n\\n*\"Philly\" = [[Philadelphia]]\\n*\"D.C.\" = [[Washington, D.C.]]\\n*\"N.Y.C.\" = [[New York City]]\\n*\"S.F\" = [[San Francisco]]\\n*\"L.A.\" = [[Los Angeles]]\\n*\"NOLA\" = [[New Orleans]] (not universally understood, but in the South at least)\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Asking for rides at rest areas or gas stations\\'\\'\\', is often one of the quickest ways to get a very long distance ride, but soliciting and loitering is might be prohibited there and sometimes you will be kicked out before finding a ride. A good way to avoid being kicked out is to greet everyone entering the building with a friendly smile and give them a friendly nod, then ask them for a ride as they leave the building. This gives them time to become comfortable with your presence and prevents them from having the opportunity to complain about your solicitation to the employees. \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Asking for rides at truck stops\\'\\'\\' is the same way.  As a rule, Love\\'s, Petro, and TA will be the quickest to kick you out. Pilot/Flying J truck stops and smaller locally owned truck stops are generally a lot more lenient. You may even find signs that prohibit you from soliciting a ride, so caution is necessary like asking instead of showing them a sign to your destination.\\n\\n=== US/State Highways ===\\nIf you are only going a hundred miles or less, you can often make better time on US highways, state highways, or even local roads. Even if you are going long distances, if you aren\\'t concerned about making good time, getting off the interstates can be a very rewarding experience. Local highways will grant you a better picture of what local life is like in that area, and typically offer a greater variety of drivers and scenery. To hitchhike on these highways, it is best to stand at the edge of town right before the speed limit picks up, even walking on the highways also helps as shoulders most of the way are pretty wide. Standing at stop lights outside of towns along these highways is also a great way to catch a ride, even if the speed limit is quite high.\\n\\n=== Urban and Suburban Short Distance ===\\nIf you are hitchhiking within a large metropolitan area and trying to get to another part of the city, it is best to stay on the interstate on-ramps unless you want to do a lot of walking. Most larger cities have interstates passing through them and often have one or more spur or circumferential interstates surrounding them. These spur and circumferential interstates are designated by a three-digit highway number with signs that look just like normal blue interstate signs. When hitchhiking on these roads, it is best to accept every ride, even if they are only going a mile, as each exit you get to is closer to your destination and you are unlikely to get stranded on any of these ramps due to the amount of traffic.\\n\\nAn alternate method to hitchhiking within urban areas is to walk up to cars stuck at red lights and ask them in person if you can have a ride in the direction they are going. This works best if they already have their window down, but usually people will roll their window down to talk to you if you stand in front of their car trying to get their attention.\\n\\nAnother way is to pay a small amount for public transportation to drop you off outside the city(check your map/GPS).\\n\\nYou may also wish to try asking for rides at smaller local gas stations, but you are unlikely to make as much progress doing this.\\n\\n=== Getting out of big cities ===\\nYou may find yourself in very sprawled out cities like LA or Phoenix, then try your luck on Craigslist! I (http://hitchwiki.org/en/User:Nora) crossed the US and found a few rides on Craiglist, messaging people who offer rides and asking if they would take me for free. Probably works best as a foreigner and a girl, but is worth a try. And maybe you can \\'pay\\' in stories or music!\\n\\n== Police/Laws ==\\n[[File:Unitedstateslaws.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Overview of hitchhiking laws by state.<br> Green: Hitchhiking legal while on the shoulder of the road <br> Yellow: Hitchhiking legal while off the traveled portion of the road, stay in the grass to be safe. <br> Red: Hitchhiking is completely illegal.<br> Gray: Specific laws, check the respective state article(s).]]\\n\\nThe legal status of hitchhiking in the United States is a bit of a difficult topic; laws and their enforcement differ greatly from state to state as does the information available online and in general knowledge. Many people (including police officers) mistakenly believe hitchhiking is illegal anywhere in the US; sometimes you\\'ll get away with holding a cardboard sign but not with holding out your thumb, and sometimes nobody will hassle you even if you stand or walk right on the interstate. The specific articles on states will give you more information on this topic.\\n\\n=== Police ===\\n\\nMany police in this country have arrest quotas, not to mention many police (not all!) are assholes.  That being said, you may encounter an officer of the law who is a rather enthusiastic about giving you a hard time.  Keep in mind that even foreigners have rights, such as the right to refuse being searched.  For good information about dealing with the police, check out https://www.flexyourrights.org/  \\n\\nBeing in a state which permits hitchhiking does not guarantee that the police will not harass you. Most police don\\'t know the laws and will tell you it is illegal to hitchhike in that state. [[User:Thewindandrain|Thewindandrain]] argues with cops on a regular basis and refuses to stop hitchhiking where it is legal. He has been innocently arrested for this twice, but has remained confident and never been taken to jail even after being cuffed and in the car and continuing to stand up for his rights. They are usually bluffing right to the very end. If you know the law in that state, don\\'t be afraid to tell the police they are wrong!\\n\\nFrequently when confronted with your response, law enforcement officers will react unprofessionally and occasionally aggressively and even in a discriminatory way if you are not their race (sad but true: white people will have an easier time than blacks or latinos). They may curse, call you names, and/or threaten to arrest you if they see you hitchhiking again and then leave the scene. This is usually a bluff. They may even cuff you then give you a ride out of their jurisdiction. Occasionally they may admit to their mistake and leave you alone. If you are uncomfortable and feel threatened by the officer, you may request to speak to his/her supervisor. Supervisors will show up to talk with you about the law openly and professionally.\\n\\n=== National laws ===\\nThe only nationwide law (Code of Federal Regulations) that prohibits hitchhiking is 36 CFR 4.31 which states that hitchhiking is illegal on any property under jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior: National Park Service. This includes but is not limited to National Parks, National Scenic Byways, and National Recreation Areas. This law is often amended  to allow hitchhiking at the discretion of each park. Check with the park\\'s respective state article for information\\n\\n=== State and local laws ===\\nLook to the map pictured above which indicates each state\\'s laws. Most often, the laws state that the hitchhiker may not \"solicit a ride\" \"on a roadway\". The word roadway is usually defined in state statute books as \"exclusive of a shoulder\" or \"the traveled portion of the highway\", making these statutes easy to circumvent.\\n\\nIn most states it\\'s illegal to hitch from the interstates ([[highway|motorways]]) themselves (though enforcement of this rule varies), but you can typically stand at [[on-ramp]]s (highway entries). That being said, understand that the ramps are still technically considered interstate property and are illegal for pedestrians to be on, although it is almost without exception permitted if you stand in front of the \"no pedestrians\" sign. \\n\\nIn some areas (such as certain towns or municipal areas) hitching is illegal everywhere, however, it is still allowed de facto. In most cases, hitchhiking is legal or tolerated. There are also many limited-access highways (i.e. with on-ramps and [[off-ramp]]s) that are not part of the interstate system which prohibit pedestrians as well. [[California]] is notorious for prohibiting pedestrians on many of its controlled access highways.\\n\\nEven in states where hitchhiking is illegal, the law is rarely enforced. Wyoming Highway Patrol reports that in 2010, they approached 524 hitchhikers but only cited eight of them (note that hitchhiking is no longer illegal in Wyoming as of 2013!)\\n\\nIf the police pass you walking or sitting by the side of the road without soliciting in any way, they may still stop to check IDs, but you are not required to identify yourself unless there is suspicion that you could have committed a crime. You may wish to hide your thumb or sign when a police car is approaching to avoid being hassled.\\n\\nOften, particularly close to major cities, the [[police]] will ask you for photo ID, but as long as you have one with you (such as a passport) there shouldn\\'t be a problem. Most of the time they will be polite when you come up clean, and not too rarely they\\'ll give you a lift out of their area to get rid of you.\\n\\nEspecially in smaller towns and in the countryside, the officer stopping you is likely to never have seen a passport before. If that\\'s your form of ID, bear with the delay caused, help the poor guy out by point out which is your name and your birth date and enjoy the confusion and the hilarious misconceptions that arise.\\n\\nTourists who intend to cross into the USA by hitchhiking should note that the US immigration department will log that you have been hitchhiking, should they discover that you are. This log will be visible to any guard who subsequently checks your immigration status. If you decide to leave and enter the USA again, it may make your entry back into the USA more difficult if it is not a hitchhiker friendly state.\\n\\n== Personal Experiences ==\\n\\n[[File:Unitedstateshitchhiking.jpg|thumb|400px|\\'\\'Relative Ease of Hitchhiking Each State of America (based on a survey of hitchhikers with 114,000 miles cumulative experience.)\\'\\'.<br> Green: Easy <br> Yellow: Average <br> Red: Difficult]]\\n\\n\\'\\'Haven\\'t hitched extensively there, but where I have, the experiences have been unique. I\\'ve hitched Oregon to Mexico along the famous highway 101. I also hitched from Oregon to Chicago on i90 in the dead of winter. Lots of clothes for that one, and a warm place to retreat to at every stop. The most remarkable thing about hitching in the States is that you get picked up by REALLY interesting people. Not all the time. But our beloved weirdos are more common in the US than anywhere else I\\'ve hitched. Regardless of what you think about the States, it\\'s easily one of the most interesting places to hitchhike, especially if you LIKE adventure.\\'\\' - [[User:Chael777|Chael]]\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'Have hitchhiked moderately in US, about 9,000 miles(including ferries and train hopping). Its a diverse country so generalizing a state or even a county(as I have been picked up in the most conservative counties) would not be right. I have been picked up by really awesome people(some of them are now my friends), Friendly cops(who offered me water and money) to discriminatory cops(who just wanted to get rid of me), people who turned out to be gay(asked sexual favors), bored people looking for a good conversation(what you have to do is just listen and and ask question to acknowledge that you are listening), people who saw me as a curious and tired foreigner etc. It was a great experience and helped me learn a lot about the culture here. One thing I learned is that if you are having fun then you get picked up easily as compared to when you are not. My personal favorite states are [[Alaska]] and [[Missouri]].\\'\\' - [[User:Keep_trying|Tarun]]\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'I hitchhiked over 200,000 miles in 50 states of the US, 19 states of Mexico, and 8 provinces of Canada I would say in general that it is easy to hitchhike in all those countries but some of the most difficult places are in America. Each state varies greatly in geography and ease of hitchhiking. In the south,  for example it is easier to hop freight trains since the hitching is so difficult. My favorite states for travelers are [[Colorado]], [[California]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oregon]], and [[Arkansas]]. I have hitched alone, and with numbers of other people. Hitchhiking with two people or large equipment like a bicycle or kayak seems to give shortest waits. I would rank hitchhiking as a slightly more risky activity than cycle touring on windy highways with no shoulder. These days I prefer to ride freight trains and motorized bicycles, and I recommend you do the same.\\'\\' - [[User:Thewindandrain|Thewindandrain]]\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'I hitchhiked from Panama to the US, intending to go through the whole of the US by hitchhiking with my little brother. I cannot recommend to hitchhike in pairs. It takes _days_ to find rides. We looked like regular guys, did 20k+ miles in more than 10 countries. If you do it, do it alone.\\'\\' - Summer \\'14\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'I crossed the US from Boston to San Francisco the southern way. The north east is tough, prepare for some waits and looks as if you were not worth anyone\\'s attention. Luckily it gets better soon! Texas was the best state for me, lots of rides even from women, and basically no waites. Also California is pretty good to hitchhike, though more tourists. To all girls - it\\'s definitely safe enough in my opinion, though I was asked for sex a few times by people not understanding hitchhiking much. And in general - for me waites for longer than in Europe (when alone I have to hardly wait longer than 10 minutes ever), but still the longest wait during the whole trip were ~2 hours at a bad spot.\\'\\' - [[user:Nora|Nora]]\\n\\n\\'\\'These experiences are from a voyage undertaken during Autumn of 2023. Approximately 6 weeks in length, 41 rides, 3000 miles. Los Angeles to New Orleans with lots of detours. For context, I am young, male, Asian, clean shaven and have short hair. I travelled with only a backpack. It was difficult to get rides, whether I was standing on an onramp, walking on the interstate, asking at gas stations, waiting after traffic lights, standing on the shoulder etc. I tried pretty much every method of hitching, and would like to say none of them have good chances of getting a ride quickly. For me, it was an even split between getting rides easily (matter of minutes) and waiting HOURS for rides. There is no State that was particularly easy, not even California along the 1 and 101 was easy, in fact some of my longest waits were in California. But of course, no one goes to the US and expects hitching to be smooth sailing. Public opinion towards hitchhikers is terrible, the vast majority don\\'t give a damn who you are, where you\\'re from and where you\\'re trying to get to. Expect to be given ugly looks and get used to being ignored, since people see you as just another homeless person, which you are. Asking at gas stations is arduous, people are often scared and a lot simply won\\'t take you no matter how nicely you ask. Mexicans will save you time and time again, they are often the only people who will pick you up on the side of the interstate or will actually hear you out at a gas station. Asking Mexicans or other Latinos in Spanish works beautifully, even a couple phrases will get you a vastly more positive response than using English. I\\xa0often freedom camped in towns and rural areas, never in cities though. No bad experiences from that, but it does get cold. I preferred hitching at on ramps over gas stations just because I didn\\'t want to run the goddamn gauntlet everytime I approached someone. Walking along the Interstate is an act of desperation, I don\\'t recommend it (but have done it many times) because it is FUCKING DANGEROUS, and loud. Now the good parts: The people who do give you rides will be fucking AMAZING. Food, weed, beer, work, money, parties, couches to surf, fishing invites, intriguing conversations, crazy people, funny people, random people. WOW. The US has got it all, a kaleidescope of humanity in overflowing abundance. When that ride finally comes, it will be awesome so HANG IN THERE. Cops didn\\'t care if they were driving past and I was on an onramp but State troopers will give you a hard time if you\\'re on an interstate, I got two rides from cops to their county border and also had the police called on me thanks to some Karen in Texas. Racism is to be expected in the South if you\\'re a person of colour, but the blacks will be so much more friendlier if you aren\\'t white. I was never threatened or harmed, but most of my drivers were terrible at driving, some drank, some were high. Be wary of that. In conclusion, this country is NOT a walk in the park to hitch. It\\'s hard. You\\'ll need determination, the patience of a saint and a little courage, but it\\'ll pay off. Trust me.\\'\\'\\n-The Falling Leaf.\\n\\nHitchhikernick - I have hitched around the US many times, only 3 short of doing every state 3 times 😁.  WOW what can I say, definitely the most generous nation. I have been given money and bought food so many times without asking, several times being 100$ bills😁.  I\\'m actually there now on a skiing trip (Feb 2024) and same thing has happened on this trip.  Waiting times have been from instant pickups where I haven\\'t had time to put my bag down to waiting 2 days consecutively (highway 6 Nevada in Feb 2014).  Never spend my own money and always leave with some money left over 😁. Average waiting time about 3.5hrs, though a lot less around ski areas. Definitely the only nation where I get checked by the cops, though many times they have proven to be helpful.  Some times I have had to walk up the onramp but never got into trouble for doing so, if cops arrived they would generally give me a ride to a better spot, never been given a ticket.  Definitely some of the greatest experiences too...drinking and partying with the natives in Monument valley, hitching and winging a ticket into Burning Man, crusing on a boat around Kachemak Bay and hiking to the magic bus in Alaska, camping and hiking around the Grand Canyon, Sedona and Yosemite, skiing all big ski resorts, experiencing city life and experiencing life with the homeless to name a few...!!! You could spend a lifetime experiencing, travelling and tasting the USA 😉. *UPDATE* I should also point out some of the downsides of hitching america, to paint a more accurate picture. On quite a few occasions, drivers would deliberately give me smoke clouds when they went past. There has been some real grumpy/bible obsessed/guilt tripping drivers. Not every police officer was so pleasant, telling me i couldn\\'t hitchhike or that it was illegal (Idaho in particular). Waiting times could be brutal on some occasions. Temperatures can be extreme on both ends, you must be prepared, especially when you are familiar with long waiting times. And last but not least, the repetitive questions...thats what i love about countries I cant speak the language (not always avoidable even if foreign language). One last point, that i must add, though not directly related to hitchhiking, is Tipping...this has become out of control in the US.  Once i had a tough day hitching so i wanted to make it better with a cheap can of beer. I went to a liqure store, found reduced price section and got a damaged can of beer for 1 usd.  When I got to the checkout to pay, the checkout girl asked how much i would like to tip. i gave her a dollar note and said that is all i have.  she then put it in a brown paper bag in a rather surly manner. its getting ridiculous and not good for budget concious travellers like hitchhikers. \\xa0Nowhere else in the world, that I have visited, is so reliant/entitled on tipping like the US. On the whole though, I have found the USA hitchhiking good and happily do it again...many times😁.

It is one of the oldest cities in the Netherlands, dating back from Roman times. Today, it has a population of over 300,000. While being a nice travel destination on its own, boasting a very picturesque inner city and hosting many events throughout the year, it also serves as one of the major transport hubs of the Netherlands. The ''Ring Utrecht'' is composed of the A27 North/South, the start/end of the A28, the A12 West/East, the A2 North/South, and the N230 connecting the A27 and A2 motorways. While the motorway maze around Utrecht might seem complicated, it is generally easy to hitch in and out of the city, as long as you know where the good spots are. \\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== North to [[Amsterdam]]===\\n{{Coords|52.0802|5.0870}}<br>\\nThe (arguably) best place to get a ride to Amsterdam is near the ''24 Oktoberplein'' in ''Kanaleneiland'', where the flyover comes down to the traffic lights. Taking any tram for Central Station, get out at ''24 Oktoberplein'', walk back to the traffic square, pass underneath the flyover and make an immediate left. Follow the road until the flyover comes down, and position yourself on the small shoulder between the two traffic lights. Absolutely awesome place. Also works well for going south!\\n\\n=== South to [[Breda]], [[Belgium]], East to [[ Amersfoort]],[[Germany]] ===\\n{{Coords|52.0798|5.1435}}<br>\\nThere is a [[liftershalte]] - a special spot for hitchhiking - at the ramp of the ''Waterlinieweg'' near ''De Galgewaard'' stadium. It's good for going northwards on the A27 and A28 (on the right when coming from Galgewaard Stadium) or southwards on the A12, A2 and A27 (crossed the highway on the left when coming from Galgewaard Stadium, indicated by a BP gas station). Official hitching spot, indicated by a traffic sign with a thumb on it. \\nTo get there, take bus 12 from the Central Station and get off at bus stop 'Stadion Galgewaard'. Cross the road and you're at the sliproad!\\n\\n(Note: as of April 28th 2019 the bus 12 does not run on Sundays however another bus [if I remember correctly the 41] does go to the same stop.)\\n\\nAlternatively, you can take bus 55 in the direction ''Maartensdijk'' and get off at the stop ''Nieuwe wetering''. From there you are able to walk to a petrol station directly on the A27. Beware though, you have to walk for about 1 kilometer next to the motorway and a hitchhiker once got a 90€ fine for that, but otherwise it's a great starting place to go south direction [[Paris]] (A27) as well as [[Luxembourg]] (A2) (Note: Looking at the satellite image on Google Maps, there seems to be some bushes between the A27 and the railway parallel to it, walking in this strip as far as possible from the A27 '''may''' just keep you out of view!)\\n\\nAlso, you can reach a petrol station on the west side of Nieuwegein, on the A2 highway. Take any tram from Utrecht Central Station, get out at Nieuwegein Stadscentrum, and walk along the Wijkerslootweg in the direction of the A2 highway (be careful, there is no sidewalk, only vegetation you'll have to walk through, and cars pass by fast, but it's perfectly doable). Cross the highway (there is a sidewalk on the bridge), take the first right after the bridge, and take another right at the little pedestrian roundabout up ahead. Then, keep walking until the petrol station appears on your right. You're already at the front end of the station by now. There's a low fence you can easily step over and walk into the station. Stepping over the fence is probably technically illegal as you enter part of the highway, but you can step over and walk in in just 10 seconds, and you circumvent the creek running round the station. From here, you can hitch to either southwest (A2) or southeast (A27).\\n\\n=== East towards [[Arnhem]] and Germany ===\\n{{Coords|52.0618|5.1786}}<br>\\nTo go east, direction [[Arnhem]] and Germany, the best thing to do is to take the train from central station to [[Bunnik]] (6 minutes), cross the footbridge across the highway, and walk along the highway back towards where you just came from for 2 kilometers. This petrol station, ''De Forten'',on the A12 is a good spot to find rides towards Arnhem. (From this place it is also possible to go to direction Berlin if you take the A50 north near Arnhem.) \\n\\nIn addition, the abovementioned liftplaats at Stadion Galgewaard is also a viable place for hitchhiking east towards Arnhem/Germany.\\n\\n=== West [[Rotterdam]],[[The Hague]] ===\\n{{Coords|52.0606|5.1056}}<br>\\nGet down to ''Kanaleneiland'' in the southwest corner of Utrecht, for instance by taking any tram leaving from Utrecht Central Station. Get out at ''Kanaleneiland Zuid''. Walk towards the A12 highway. There's an entry lane leading up to the A12 on your right hand side where there's ample room for cars to stop on the hard shoulder. \\n\\nAlternatively, try the spot near the 24 Oktoberplein as mentioned above. Although the road directly leads to the North/Southbound A2, you can find people going west on the A12. (I tried this myself and it worked)\\n\\n== Sleeping ==\\nFor wild camping, it's best to stay at the university area (De Uithof). Take bus 28 or 12 from the main train station in Utrecht (Utrecht Centraal Station) and you will know where to get out when you see the large school buildings. There are great spots to camp there and little to no guards. It's pretty far away from the city center, so you should be able to sleep pretty safe there.\\n\\nAlternatively you can ask the friendly people at the local vegan café if they know anywhere you can stay for free:\\n''ACU, Voorstraat 71'', vegan food on donation basis is served on Saturdays, and Sundays.\\n\\n== Other useful info ==\\n\\n=== Free Internet ===\\n\\nThe main Library in Utrecht has a computer that you can use without paying for the internet. It's on the second floor, and as you face the room, there is a row of three computers in front of you (but behind the desk of the person who works there). The one that works for free is at the end of the row on the right from the perspective of sitting at the computer.\\n\\nThe library in the university area (Uithof) also has some computers with free internet. Enter the area by the Heidelberglaan, this is the street with only buses on it. There are two buildings above the road. The second building (coming from the city centre) is connected to the library. The north of this building is connected to the computer rooms, which have a few computers with free internet, and don't require you to log in. \\n\\nA pilot project until the end of 2013 offers free wifi at Vredenburg, Stadhuisplein and Domplein. Network name: 'Free Wifi Utrecht'.\\n\\nAs of Sep 2013 free wifi at central station on the KPN network as well as on  [http://www.ns.nl/over-ns/nieuwscentrum/nieuwsberichten/2013/09/ns-biedt-in-samenwerking-met-kpn-gratis-wifi-op-stations-aan.html  48 train stations in NL].\\n\\n[http://www.openwifispots.com/country-city_free_wifi_wireless_hotspot-Utrecht_NL.aspx  Free hotspots in Utrecht (unverified)].\\n\\n\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n<!--Infoboxes and categories.

One highway, the {{E|15}}, is linking [[Marseille]] to [[Lyon]], and another highway is going towards [[Grenoble]] and [[Italy]].\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== North/South towards [[Lyon]], [[Paris]], [[Marseille]] ===\\nTo get on the A7, you have two possibilities : Valence Nord (North) or Valence Sud (South). I much prefer the on-ramp at Valence Nord, because there\\'s more space for cars to stop. I never waited more than 30 minutes at this spot. I use it to either go North or South, but most cars are going North. I have to sometimes decline a few cars going North if I want to go South, but I always end up finding a car rather quickly.\\nGoing South : The first service area is soon after Valence South, so if a car is going past Valence accept the ride, and get dropped at this service area to search for another car.\\nGoing North : Most cars are going to Lyon, and if you don\\'t you\\'ll have to get down at the toll near Vienne (there\\'s a parking area with a few cars) or before in a bigger gas station.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Marseille]], [[Montpellier]], [[Barcelona]] ===\\n\\nIt is actually very easy to get to the first service area south of Valence, in Aire de Portes-lès-Valence, by taking the city bus. As of November 2019 the fare is 1.4 euros and the bus route is number 10. It runs every 20-30 minutes, passing right in front of the Valence Ville station in the centre. Full details can be found [https://storage.googleapis.com/is-wp-46-prod/uploads-prod/2019/07/bfb39599-ligne-10-depliant-2019-2020.pdf/ here].\\n\\nYou take it to the very end, getting off at the stop d\\'Orves (the bus does a little loop and passes the same spot as the second to last stop out of Valence and first on the way back in, as the map in the above link demonstrates). From there you walk west on Rue Estienne d\\'Orves to Route Nationale 7, cross the A7, and then turn left down the road that you see immediately after crossing (there will be a little shortcut trail at the bend there). Continue down this road and you get to the gate for the service area. Though the gate looks imposing upon approach, when [[User:Movethathoof|Movethathoof]] passed through in November 2019 he found the gate without a lock; there was a place for where it may have once been, but it now just pushes open.\\n\\nFrom this station there is lots of traffic to Marseille, but much less toward Montpellier and Barcelona. [[User:Movethathoof|Movethathoof]] was quickly offered many rides to Marseille on his way to Montpellier, and decided to take one to get to the final service area before the road splits. This service area, Aire de Mornas Village, is around 80 kilometers further down the road, just before Orange. It is much bigger, with more traffic (including a much larger area for trucks), and though he was again offered many rides to Marseille first, he did get a ride quite quickly to Nimes. The roundabout before entering the highway doesn\\'t leave a lot of space for people to stop, but that didn\\'t stop many people from stopping to offer a ride. \\n\\nNote: Neither of the above mentioned service areas have easily accessible recyclable containers; if you\\'ll need cardboard for a sign you might be better served finding it before heading there.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Grenoble]], [[Italy]] ===\\nThere\\'s a massive roundabout near the shopping area \"Les Couleures\". There\\'s a bus stop not far from there. You can stand at the entrance of the national road N532 towards Grenoble. It becomes a highway after 30-40 kilometers, but there are a few service areas in between. There\\'s enough space for cars to stop.\\n\\n== Accommodation and Sleep ==\\nYou can probably get away with camping for a night near the Rhone river.\\n\\n{{IsIn|Rhône-Alpes}}\\n[[Category:Rhône-Alpes]]\\n\\n[[Category:France]]\\n[[Category:E15]]',\n",

Together with Viña del Mar and other towns it creates a conurbation of more than 900,000 inhabitants. Locals call the city Valpo.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== North towards [[La Serena]] or East towards [[Mendoza]] ([[Argentina]])===\\nFrom \\'\\'Avenida Errazuriz\\'\\' in Valparaíso, for example near the metro station \\'\\'Bellavista\\'\\' take any micro (mini bus) that goes to Quilpue, there\\'s plenty of them and it costs around 600 pesos. Tell the driver that you want to get off near the \\'\\'\\'\\'\\'Puente Lusitania\\'\\'\\'\\'\\' (Lusitania Bridge) in Viña del Mar. Go to the other side of the bridge and turn left (east). After 500m you will see a roundabout where motorway begins. Hitch there with a sign. A lot of the traffic will be heading southeast to Santiago by motorways 62 and 5, so you can make a sign \"Peaje Llay Llay\", which is a huge toll plaza located on the Panamerican Higway 5, twenty km south from La Calera. From there you can hitch either south to Santiago, east to San Felipe, Los Andes and Mendoza or north to La Serena.\\n\\n=== Southeast towards [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]]===\\nGet to \\'\\'\\'\\'\\'Avenida Argentina\\'\\'\\'\\'\\'. You can either walk from the historic centre (30 minutes) or take any micro (mini bus) that goes to \\'\\'Congreso\\'\\' or \\'\\'Terminal de Buses\\'\\'. At the southern end of the avenue there is a beginning of the motorway 68 with a COPEC petrol station. It\\'s a perfect spot for hitching. Make a sign. There will be no trucks, but it\\'s easy to find a lift with cars and they usually go to the centre of Santiago.  \\n\\n\\'\\'Thumbing it, I got a ride from this gas station in less than five minutes.  \\'\\' --[[User:Dr.Keith|Keith]]\\n\\nAnother option is to take a micro (mini bus) in Valparaíso to Placilla and leave the bus in the entrance to Placilla, then walk like 500 meters to the last petrol station, which is COPEC (there are three petrol stations in a row) always walking near the highway. After the COPEC there is a curve where all the trucks leave the city and it is very easy to catch one. Not all the trucks go to Santiago so try to take one going straight there or get off at the last toll plaza before Santiago called \\'\\'Peaje Lo Prado\\'\\' and catch another lift.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking in ==\\nIf you happen to be going to Valparaíso and your driver is going to Viña del Mar, your fastest option is to get off in Placilla located 12 km south from Valpo. From there you can take a micro (mini bus) going to the city centre. It should cost around 600 pesos. The bus stop is located on the side of the motorway near the pedestrian bridge over the road.\\n\\n\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n{{IsIn|Chile}}\\n{{Category|Chile}}\\n[[Category:Chile]]\\n\\n[[fr:Valparaiso]]',\n",

Even more so, hitchhiking out of Veliky Novgorod towards Saint Petersburg is quite easy for there is only one road going out of the city which is the Bolshaya Sankt-Peterburgskaya (Большая Санкт-Петербургская). The busses from the centre which drive over this road towards the North are numbers 5, 9, 9a and 101 and costs about 20p.\\n\\nThe best spot to start hitchhiking is just after the last major turn of the main road, because than you can be sure that all cars are going towards Saint Petersburg. I started just after the Петербургская топливная компания petrol station. I got out of the bus, walked a bit further back where the bus came from so that cars could stop at the busstop and hold up my sign saying Kуда Санкт-Петербургская (Direction Saint Petersburg).

Take from the main railway station the bus to Sommacampagna or Villafranca (should be n°160, not sure though) and get off where the driver will tell you. Turn right from the bus route, then left at the first stop sign, should be about 1km walking, the gas station fence is very easily jumpable.\\n\\n===West towards [[Brescia]], [[Milano]], [[Torino]] and [[France]]===\\nDidn\\'t try this way yet, though should be easier from the motorway entrance \"Verona Nord\". Quite near, west of the city, reachable with public transport.\\n\\n===South towards [[Florence]], [[Bologna]], [[Modena]] and [[Rome]]===\\nDo not take the south gates to the highway! Never!

You have to jump a gate and get through a fence (which had been partially cut through in April 2018) to reach the toll stations.\\n\\nUpdate August 2019: Gate was under CCTV and you can\\'t fully see what\\'s going on. Walked around to the other main road that takes you towards the highway. Can hitch asking for Casello (toll) or telepass. Alternatively, there is a dirt road just off the main road that will take you all the way, need to climb a hill at the end. \\n\\nOnce at the Casello, hold up a sign saying Trento. Once in a car ask to be dropped at the last petrol station before Trento. It can be a very long wait at the toll but you will need to do a trip north in small jumps along the highway. Trento > Brennero > Innsbruck etc. Be sure to hitch in front of the toll otherwise the police tell you to move on, and bring plenty of water. Nothing around in this area and the sun can be brutal.\\n\\n====Other option====\\nTake train from Verona to \"Borghetto sull\\'Adige\" (cca 5 euros in August 2024). Cross a bride over the river (Adige) and take a small road on the left (just before the bridge over highway A22). The road leads to an Eni gas station (Area de Adige Est). Unfortuanately, the gas station is completely fenced off, but at one point (about midway between bridge and the gas station) the type of fence changes and it is relatively easy to climb over it. \\n\\n===Other Options===\\nFrom Peschiera, a place near Lago di Garda (the train from Verona to Peschiera is about 5 euros) it is about 2-3 kilometers walk from the center to the entrance on the highway and you might try hitchiking from there.\\n\\n== Sleeping ==\\n\\nThere are hills just near the center around Castel San Pietro and probably stealth camping is possible there, but there is also a great camp: http://www.campingcastelsanpietro.com/articles.asp?id=8\\nThey have clean showers separated for men and women, a big terrace with a kitchen and free wi-fi and power outlets.

Since a direct ride to Salzburg is possible try to avoid \"part-rides\" and avoid going to St. Polten at all cost- the traffic there is very low and mostly local.

Then cross over the bridge. You\\'ll see the petrol station after about 300m to your left. Cross the bridge and then it\\'s a short walk behind the barrier along the side of the road.  There is as a big resting area with service station.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Prague]] ===\\n\\nThe easiest way to get from Vienna to Prague is to go through [[Brno]]. \\n\\nThere is an option to go straight from Vienna to Prague. Take a train from \\'\\'Handelskai\\'\\' to \\'\\'Kornneuburg\\'\\'. Get out of the station and turn left. You\\'ll get to a street called Doktor-Max-Burckhard-Ring, it will take you to the main street (Stockerauer Straße) Follow the main street, and then turn left on any of the first two streets (Scherzgasse or Hofaustraße) Turn right, and you\\'ll get to the street that crosses the railways. Cross the railway and walk further until you see an on-ramp. There is also a petrol station to hitchhike from. However, most cars are only going to nearby towns from which it is not possible to hitchhike further. Again, try going through Brno instead.\\n\\n\\n=== North towards [[Brno]] ([[Czech Republic]]) {{European Route Number|461}} ===\\n\\n[[File:MrTweek.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[MrTweek]] hitching to [[Vienna]]]]\\n\\n====Option 1====\\n\\nFrom central Wien take tram 31 to the last stop, \\'\\'Stammersdorf\\'\\'.

From where the bus stops, cross the parking lot towards the big street that the bus had taken out of Vienna and cross that street.

[https://goo.gl/maps/a9pXqeusHft GoogleMaps Footpath]\\n\\n=== East towards [[Bratislava]], [[Győr]] and [[Budapest]] {{Aat|4}} {{European Route Number|60}} ===\\n\\nThere is an OMV [[petrol station hitchhiking|petrol station]] with a McD on the motorway to Budapest where you can easily find a ride to Bratislava, [[Hungary]] or further.\\n\\nTo get to this petrol station by public transport, take metro line U3 to \\'\\'Enkplatz\\'\\' and from there you can take a bus 76A to \\'\\'7.&nbsp;Haidequerstraße\\'\\' (the bus stop is on the other side of the street at the intersection when you leave the metro station). Be careful because there are two stops with almost the same name, \\'\\'7.&nbsp;Haidequerstraße\\'\\' and \\'\\'11.&nbsp;Haidequerstraße\\'\\' – get off at the first one, which comes after the stop \\'\\'Simmeringer Haide\\'\\'. After the stop, the bus turns right, but to get to the petrol station, walk straight on on to the north for just 200&nbsp;m. The petrol station is on the [[A4 (Austria)|A4]] highway towards Bratislava, Győr and Budapest. Once you have reached the petrol station, just wait near the entrance and ask drivers entering the shop.\\n\\nNote: Watch out for Romanian drivers who may attempt to charge you for the ride; make sure before you accept a lift from a Romanian driver that you are not going to pay by saying e.g. \\'\\'E gratis? / N-am bani sa va dau.\\'\\' ‘\\'\\'\"Is the lift free? / I can\\'t pay.’\\n\\nMost of the cars passing in this petrol station are coming off the motorway or going to the airport. You can get more cars going to [[Slovakia]] or [[Hungary]] if you take the first ride to the next petrol station on the motorway, named Göttlesbrunn, which is just before road splits into the E58 towards Bratislava and the E60 towards Budapest. The E60 road enters Hungary at the [[Hegyeshalom-Nickelsdorf border crossing]].\\n\\nIf your ultimate destination is [[Romania]], then ask your driver to leave you at the [[Hegyeshalom-Nickelsdorf border crossing]] and hitch from there with a sign Romania\\n\\n\\n=== South towards [[Graz]], [[Slovenia]], [[Zagreb]] {{Aat|2}}===\\n\\n===Option 1: Triesterstraße, highly recommended===\\n\\nWith the completion of the construction site the hitchspot at the [https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2043915283 onramp from Triesterstraße] is open again.\\n\\nThere is a lot of space to stop. On empty streets cars will go 70km/h but they are slower (<50km/h) when there is more traffic (during most of the day). There is also street light and a bridge in case of night or rain. There is even a small section of gras with trees where you can camp. Public transport: Badner Bahn from Wien Meidling, station Wien Inzersdorf, ~5 min walk. A regular Vienna City Ticket (2,40€ in 2020) is sufficient.\\n\\nThere are several places beforehand on Triesterstraße where people tried hitchhiking. Triesterstraße / Computerstraße, public transport: Bus 16a from U6 Am Schöpfwerk. Triesterstraße / Herta-Firnberg-Straße, you can only ask people - no thumbing, includes a McDonalds and a gas station, public transport: Bus 7B from train station Wien Meidling\\n\\n===Option 2: ===\\n\\nOther option if you want to pay EUR 3.40 for the train then take the \\'\\'Badener Bahn\\'\\' to \\'\\'Maria-Enzersdorf (Südstadt)\\'\\' Advantages of the latter one: it goes more often and earlier in the morning than the bus. If you take the train, you can go to one station after \\'\\'Shopping City Süd\\'\\' which is called \\'\\'Maria-Enzersdorf (Südstadt)\\'\\'. This one is closer to the actual [[slip road|interchange]]: just get off the train, head the direction you came from, turn right by the end of the platform, cross the tracks, pass 100 m of wild grass and there is a curved street – you\\'ll see the signs.\\n\\nAlternatively you can take public transport to \\'\\'Matzleinsdorfer Platz\\'\\' where the \\'\\'Triester Straße\\'\\' begins [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Triester+Stra%C3%9Fe+2,+Vienna,+%C3%96sterreich&aq=0&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=26.674078,56.513672&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Triester+Stra%C3%9Fe+2,+Favoriten+1100+Wien,+Austria&z=15] (direction South-West). This road is extremely long but it has on-ramps for heading South ([[Graz]]). Try hitching along this road, or ask at the petrol station. If you keep walking down there is a perfect place for hitchhiking where cars take the exit and join the highway. There is a lot of grass and a perfect place with enough room for even a truck to stop.\\n\\n===Option 3: Grünbergstraße / Altmannsdorfer Straße===\\n\\nIf you are OK with hitchhiking at traffic lights, you can also just go to \"Schönbrunn\" with U4 (underground – green line). Cross the street and walk towards the entrance of Schönbrunn-castle. Now you are on \"Grünbergstraße\". Here you can try to hitchhike from the traffic lights. This street leads to \"Altmannsdorfer Straße\" which leads to A2 (the motorway leading to the south)\\n\\nFor everyone going to Slovenia or Zagreb, know that there are no petrol station on your side of the road some 100 kilometres before Graz. The first one is near Leibnitz, some 15-20 km after Graz. So if someone offers you a ride to Graz, try to see if they\\'re maybe going to Leibnitz or past Leibnitz. There are many people from Maribor working in Graz, so if you end up in Graz, try using a sign for Maribor on roads going out of the city towards the highway. The petrol station near Leibnitz is on the way to Maribor.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking in ==\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'From [[Germany]]\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nMost of the traffic going through [[Passau]] is heading East to [[Linz]], [[Vienna]], [[Budapest]] while most of the traffic going through [[Salzburg]] is heading South to [[Trieste]], [[Italy]], [[Slovenia]], [[Balkans]].\\n\\nYou should then seriously consider coming by the E56 (even if you come from southern Germany).\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'From East, West\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nIf your driver heads to [[Slovakia]] ([[Bratislava]]), [[Hungary]] or the eastern [[Balkans]] they\\'ll pass the Airport at \"Schwechat\". There is public transportation, of course, but if you are in the departure area there are a lot of drivers emptying their cars before going back to the city.\\n\\nIf you find yourself in a car that is passing through Vienna on the eastern ring road, try getting out around the Donau island (German: \\'\\'Donauinsel\\'\\'), close to the river. From here you can walk to a metro-station that usually heads directly towards the centre of Vienna.\\n\\nYou will often find yourself, especially at night, on the E60 passing south of Vienna. I dont know if trucks can go there since you have to go through an underpass: Jump out at the exit \"Campus 21\"/\"Breitenfurterstrasse\" [https://goo.gl/maps/arqWXJGH2eD2 GoogleMaps]. Take care since it is an exit with 2 exits, you should keep as right as possible! About 100m further there is a roundabout where you can jump out and the car can get directly back to the highway. From that roundabout it is about 3km to the next U-Bahn, the final stop of U6. I found this to be the shortest way to get to public transport. If you come at night, there is a so called ASTAX, you call a number, and from the moment when there are enough people that want to go a small bus comes and picks you up, you pay by buying a regular ticket ([http://www.wienerlinien.at/media/download/2015/ASTAX_N64_141310.pdf Number, Schedule, ... in German]). The ASTAX will bring you to the night bus N64 that is driving through basically all Vienna ([http://www.netzplanwien.at/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Nachtnetz-Wien_20131215.pdf map in German for public nightlines in Vienna]).\\n\\n== Public transport ==\\n\\nIt is possible to ride the subway, bus, and tram system with no ticket, though at your own risk. Buses and trams are almost never controlled (except night buses and in the first month of each semester, e.g. October and March), but checks on the metro are rather frequent.

Exit the station, then walk 300 m southeast to the pedestrian bridge over the railway tracks. This pedestrian bridge will bring you over the railway tracks, the Danube canal and the motorway. On the other side, behind a few houses, there is a vast park where you can pitch a tent. You can even sleep late, as in the mornings the only passers-by are joggers and riders on horseback.\\n\\n[[File:Vienna-erdberg-sleeping.png|200px|thumb|left|The walk from Vienna\\'s U3 metro station Erdberg to a park for camping.]]\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2: Park Prater\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nAlmost the same as Erdberg but a lot closer to the city centre, you can camp in the Prater Park / Jesuitenwiese.

More than 1.6 million people live there. It is the largest city of Austria and is surrounded by the state of [[Lower Austria]]. It is also an administrative district (Bundesland) of its own.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n\\n=== From Vienna Airport all directions [[Bratislava]], [[Budapest]], [[Brno]], [[Linz]] or [[Graz]] ===\\n\\nVienna Airport is the largest one in the region and many people who are leaving or landing are being dropped or picked up there by their friends or family members. You can find rides in all of the directions by asking the drivers there according to their license plates. Departing travelers are often dropped at the Abflugstrasse above the ground floor of the terminals, arriving travelers are picked at the Kurzparkplatz in front of the arrival hall. Chance of getting such ride might be better at the Abflugstrasse as the driver going back has free place, but the with the arriving ones you will surely hear fresh travel stories.\\n\\n\\n=== West towards [[Linz]], [[Salzburg]], [[Munich]] {{Aat|1}} {{European Route Number|60}} ===\\n\\n==== Option 1: Petrol station Unter-St. Veit ====\\n\\nTake the U4 to \\'\\'Ober St. Veit\\'\\' and you\\'ll find a petrol station on the other side of the road. Just ask around and you\\'ll find a ride within minutes.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Personal experiences\\'\\'\\'\\n\\n\\'\\'Lots of German license plates coming through here. Was able to get a ride going all the way to Western Germany in around an hour of waiting. Worth holding out if you would like to get through Austria all in one chunk. - [[User:AloysiusDente|AloysiusDente]] (March 2024)\\'\\'\\n\\n==== Option 2: Hadikgasse Busstop, recommended option ====\\n\\nTake the U4 to \\'\\'Hütteldorf\\'\\', get off and go towards \\'\\'Hadikgasse\\'\\' (left), walk left again, then you are right on the main road leading out of \\'\\'\\'Vienna\\'\\'\\' towards the A1. There is a bus stop which is a well known hitching spot. Change cars (if necessary) at the [[rest area]]s \\'\\'[[Sankt Pölten|St. Pölten]]\\'\\' or \\'\\'Ansfelden\\'\\'. Since a direct ride to Salzburg is possible try to avoid \"part-rides\" and avoid going to St. Polten at all cost- the traffic there is very low and mostly local. From here you can as well get to option \"2\" by crossing the motorway via the bridge and walk for about 2km to the right.<br>\\n\\n==== Option 3: OMV petrol station on Wiener Straße (A1) ====\\n\\nTake train (S50) to \\'\\'Wien Wolf in der Au\\'\\'. Then cross over the bridge. You\\'ll see the petrol station after about 300m to your left. Cross the bridge and then it\\'s a short walk behind the barrier along the side of the road.  There is as a big resting area with service station.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Prague]] ===\\n\\nThe easiest way to get from Vienna to Prague is to go through [[Brno]]. \\n\\nThere is an option to go straight from Vienna to Prague. Take a train from \\'\\'Handelskai\\'\\' to \\'\\'Kornneuburg\\'\\'. Get out of the station and turn left. You\\'ll get to a street called Doktor-Max-Burckhard-Ring, it will take you to the main street (Stockerauer Straße) Follow the main street, and then turn left on any of the first two streets (Scherzgasse or Hofaustraße) Turn right, and you\\'ll get to the street that crosses the railways. Cross the railway and walk further until you see an on-ramp. There is also a petrol station to hitchhike from. However, most cars are only going to nearby towns from which it is not possible to hitchhike further. Again, try going through Brno instead.\\n\\n\\n=== North towards [[Brno]] ([[Czech Republic]]) {{European Route Number|461}} ===\\n\\n[[File:MrTweek.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[MrTweek]] hitching to [[Vienna]]]]\\n\\n====Option 1====\\n\\nFrom central Wien take tram 31 to the last stop, \\'\\'Stammersdorf\\'\\'. Continue on your right down the main street, Brünner Str (road no.&nbsp;7); go past the Billa Plus supermarket until you come to another shopping centre, about 300&nbsp;m further. Hitchhike right after the entrance to the parking lot. \\n\\nYou can use a sign \"Brno\", but if you don\\'t get a lift after 30 minutes, then just hitchhike without a sign and ask any driver to take you to Wolkersdorf or Mistelbach. There is a huge petrol station 5&nbsp;km north of Wolkersdorf and from there it is easy to find a lift into the Czech Republic.\\n\\n====Option 2====\\n\\nTake the [https://www.g3-shopping.at/services/bus-shuttle-s11150/ free bus to G3 Shopping Center] . The Bus starts from the regional buses\\' stop in front of the \"Floridsdorf Bahnhof\" train station, they depart in 30 minute intervals, more frequently during Fridays/Saturdays, first bus at 08:00am. If you do make the terrible mistake of taking the local bus instead of the free one, it will cost you 4.20 euro and you can\\'t black-ride, as it\\'s paid to the driver. From where the bus stops, cross the parking lot towards the big street that the bus had taken out of Vienna and cross that street. There is a petrol station \"Eni\" (the yellow one) and next to that there is a free, unused lane for cars and trucks to stop easily. [https://goo.gl/maps/a9pXqeusHft GoogleMaps Footpath]\\n\\n=== East towards [[Bratislava]], [[Győr]] and [[Budapest]] {{Aat|4}} {{European Route Number|60}} ===\\n\\nThere is an OMV [[petrol station hitchhiking|petrol station]] with a McD on the motorway to Budapest where you can easily find a ride to Bratislava, [[Hungary]] or further.\\n\\nTo get to this petrol station by public transport, take metro line U3 to \\'\\'Enkplatz\\'\\' and from there you can take a bus 76A to \\'\\'7.&nbsp;Haidequerstraße\\'\\' (the bus stop is on the other side of the street at the intersection when you leave the metro station). Be careful because there are two stops with almost the same name, \\'\\'7.&nbsp;Haidequerstraße\\'\\' and \\'\\'11.&nbsp;Haidequerstraße\\'\\' – get off at the first one, which comes after the stop \\'\\'Simmeringer Haide\\'\\'. After the stop, the bus turns right, but to get to the petrol station, walk straight on on to the north for just 200&nbsp;m. The petrol station is on the [[A4 (Austria)|A4]] highway towards Bratislava, Győr and Budapest. Once you have reached the petrol station, just wait near the entrance and ask drivers entering the shop.\\n\\nNote: Watch out for Romanian drivers who may attempt to charge you for the ride; make sure before you accept a lift from a Romanian driver that you are not going to pay by saying e.g. \\'\\'E gratis? / N-am bani sa va dau.\\'\\' ‘\\'\\'\"Is the lift free? / I can\\'t pay.’\\n\\nMost of the cars passing in this petrol station are coming off the motorway or going to the airport. You can get more cars going to [[Slovakia]] or [[Hungary]] if you take the first ride to the next petrol station on the motorway, named Göttlesbrunn, which is just before road splits into the E58 towards Bratislava and the E60 towards Budapest. The E60 road enters Hungary at the [[Hegyeshalom-Nickelsdorf border crossing]].\\n\\nIf your ultimate destination is [[Romania]], then ask your driver to leave you at the [[Hegyeshalom-Nickelsdorf border crossing]] and hitch from there with a sign Romania\\n\\n\\n=== South towards [[Graz]], [[Slovenia]], [[Zagreb]] {{Aat|2}}===\\n\\n===Option 1: Triesterstraße, highly recommended===\\n\\nWith the completion of the construction site the hitchspot at the [https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2043915283 onramp from Triesterstraße] is open again.\\n\\nThere is a lot of space to stop. On empty streets cars will go 70km/h but they are slower (<50km/h) when there is more traffic (during most of the day). There is also street light and a bridge in case of night or rain. There is even a small section of gras with trees where you can camp. Public transport: Badner Bahn from Wien Meidling, station Wien Inzersdorf, ~5 min walk. A regular Vienna City Ticket (2,40€ in 2020) is sufficient.\\n\\nThere are several places beforehand on Triesterstraße where people tried hitchhiking. Triesterstraße / Computerstraße, public transport: Bus 16a from U6 Am Schöpfwerk. Triesterstraße / Herta-Firnberg-Straße, you can only ask people - no thumbing, includes a McDonalds and a gas station, public transport: Bus 7B from train station Wien Meidling\\n\\n===Option 2: ===\\n\\nOther option if you want to pay EUR 3.40 for the train then take the \\'\\'Badener Bahn\\'\\' to \\'\\'Maria-Enzersdorf (Südstadt)\\'\\' Advantages of the latter one: it goes more often and earlier in the morning than the bus. If you take the train, you can go to one station after \\'\\'Shopping City Süd\\'\\' which is called \\'\\'Maria-Enzersdorf (Südstadt)\\'\\'. This one is closer to the actual [[slip road|interchange]]: just get off the train, head the direction you came from, turn right by the end of the platform, cross the tracks, pass 100 m of wild grass and there is a curved street – you\\'ll see the signs.\\n\\nAlternatively you can take public transport to \\'\\'Matzleinsdorfer Platz\\'\\' where the \\'\\'Triester Straße\\'\\' begins [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Triester+Stra%C3%9Fe+2,+Vienna,+%C3%96sterreich&aq=0&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=26.674078,56.513672&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Triester+Stra%C3%9Fe+2,+Favoriten+1100+Wien,+Austria&z=15] (direction South-West). This road is extremely long but it has on-ramps for heading South ([[Graz]]). Try hitching along this road, or ask at the petrol station. If you keep walking down there is a perfect place for hitchhiking where cars take the exit and join the highway. There is a lot of grass and a perfect place with enough room for even a truck to stop.\\n\\n===Option 3: Grünbergstraße / Altmannsdorfer Straße===\\n\\nIf you are OK with hitchhiking at traffic lights, you can also just go to \"Schönbrunn\" with U4 (underground – green line). Cross the street and walk towards the entrance of Schönbrunn-castle. Now you are on \"Grünbergstraße\". Here you can try to hitchhike from the traffic lights. This street leads to \"Altmannsdorfer Straße\" which leads to A2 (the motorway leading to the south)\\n\\nFor everyone going to Slovenia or Zagreb, know that there are no petrol station on your side of the road some 100 kilometres before Graz. The first one is near Leibnitz, some 15-20 km after Graz. So if someone offers you a ride to Graz, try to see if they\\'re maybe going to Leibnitz or past Leibnitz. There are many people from Maribor working in Graz, so if you end up in Graz, try using a sign for Maribor on roads going out of the city towards the highway. The petrol station near Leibnitz is on the way to Maribor.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking in ==\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'From [[Germany]]\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nMost of the traffic going through [[Passau]] is heading East to [[Linz]], [[Vienna]], [[Budapest]] while most of the traffic going through [[Salzburg]] is heading South to [[Trieste]], [[Italy]], [[Slovenia]], [[Balkans]].\\n\\nYou should then seriously consider coming by the E56 (even if you come from southern Germany).\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'From East, West\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nIf your driver heads to [[Slovakia]] ([[Bratislava]]), [[Hungary]] or the eastern [[Balkans]] they\\'ll pass the Airport at \"Schwechat\". There is public transportation, of course, but if you are in the departure area there are a lot of drivers emptying their cars before going back to the city.\\n\\nIf you find yourself in a car that is passing through Vienna on the eastern ring road, try getting out around the Donau island (German: \\'\\'Donauinsel\\'\\'), close to the river. From here you can walk to a metro-station that usually heads directly towards the centre of Vienna.\\n\\nYou will often find yourself, especially at night, on the E60 passing south of Vienna. I dont know if trucks can go there since you have to go through an underpass: Jump out at the exit \"Campus 21\"/\"Breitenfurterstrasse\" \\'\\'GoogleMaps\\'\\' {{Coords|48.116017|16.2891633|1}}. Take care since it is an exit with 2 exits, you should keep as right as possible! About 100m further there is a roundabout where you can jump out and the car can get directly back to the highway. From that roundabout it is about 3km to the next U-Bahn, the final stop of U6. I found this to be the shortest way to get to public transport. If you come at night, there is a so called ASTAX, you call a number, and from the moment when there are enough people that want to go a small bus comes and picks you up, you pay by buying a regular ticket ([http://www.wienerlinien.at/media/download/2015/ASTAX_N64_141310.pdf Number, Schedule, ... in German]). The ASTAX will bring you to the night bus N64 that is driving through basically all Vienna ([http://www.netzplanwien.at/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Nachtnetz-Wien_20131215.pdf map in German for public nightlines in Vienna]).\\n\\n== Public transport ==\\n\\nIt is possible to ride the subway, bus, and tram system with no ticket, though at your own risk. Buses and trams are almost never controlled (except night buses and in the first month of each semester, e.g. October and March), but checks on the metro are rather frequent. Also they check trams around center.The fine is EUR 103, but foreigners can give a fake address in their home country and avoid paying.\\n\\nThe Wiener Linien themselves provide information on where their ticket inspectors are riding on any given day (https://www.wienerlinien.at/web/wiener-linien/kontrollen).

It is an important spot on the direct connection between [[Germany]] and Slovenia respectively [[Croatia]]. Every year numerous people that go for holidays to the Croatian coast pass here.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\nIn Villach there is a big motorway intersection (\\'\\'Knoten Villach\\'\\' in German). You can go to Italy via the {{Aat|2}}, to Slovenia via the {{Aat|11}}, north towards Salzburg via the {{Aat|10}} and east towards Vienna via the {{Aat|2}}.\\n=== South towards [[Slovenia]], [[Ljubljana]] {{Aat|11}} {{E|61}} ===\\nTo the south there is a motorway going through the Karawanken Tunnel over to Jesenice (\\'\\'Aßling\\'\\' in German) in Slovenia. Apart from that there is also the old road over the pass.\\n\\nOne possibility is catching a ride towards Salzburg to the next petrol station in Feistritz. Plenty of cars stopping there in \\'\\'\\'both\\'\\'\\' directions (north and south).\\n\\nBut the best is to go from the city centre almost directly to the east along Faakersee-Bundesstrasse (Ludwig Walter Strasse, then Maria Gailer Strasse) over the river and before the fork to the Süd-Autobahn there is a bus station where you can hitchhike and cars can stop and pick you up.\\nYou can already start hitchhiking at the bus stop across from the McDonald\\'s on your way, it is between a gas station and the McDonald\\'s and just after a traffic light so cars go slow.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Salzburg]], [[Germany]] {{Aat|10}} {{E|55}} ===\\nTo the north there is the {{Aat|10}} motorway going to [[Salzburg]] and [[Germany]].\\n\\nFrom the central train Station walk the Vassacher Straße North until you hit Drautal Straße. Behind the Bridge is a tiny Spot on the left side between two streets. The 100 going North eventually Hits the A10, it is possible to get a ride to that point or further.\\n\\nThe Meeting Point between 100 an A10 after that Spot to the north is a rather small roundabout. It is difficult to walk to that point. If somebody drives you there you can place yourself right before the entering Street to the A10. If people want to stop for you they will have to stop right in the roundabout - it will feel very unlikely to get a ride from that spot (but it is possible). If you don\\'t enter the A10 the police won\\'t bother you there - but might stop and question you. \\n\\n=== East towards [[Graz]], [[Vienna]] & [[Hungary]] {{Aat|2}} {{E|66}} ===\\nThere is the {{Aat|2}} motorway going east towards Graz, Vienna and Hungary. Try to find a ride which takes you to the service station between Villach and [[Klagenfurt]]. There are a lot of rides going in all directions from there.\\n\\nBehind the bus stop Villach Neulandskron there\\'s an A1 gas station and you can stand with your sign in front of it. Using a sign with \"Klagenfurt\" (or \"KL\") will let people know which way you want to go on the Autobahn, however we caught a ride in less 10 minutes and it took us all the way to Graz.\\n\\nWe were also recommended a spot at the  Vassacher See bus stop. We abandoned it because it is very cold and wet there in the early morning but it seems to be a decent option and there\\'s a camping site nearby.\\n\\n=== Southwest towards [[Udine]], [[Venice]] & [[Italy]] {{Aat|2}} {{E|55}} ===\\nThere is the {{Aat|2}} motorway going southwest towards Udine, Venice and Italy in general. Just before the border there is a big service station.\\n\\nThe OMV gas station near a McDonald\\'s on Maria-Gailer-Straße has traffic to Vienna, Germany and Italy. It took a while but eventually we caught a ride to Venice from there and it seems like there could be some good spots to spend the nigh in the area as well.\\n\\nOther option is to go to bus station Federaun Brücke and in direction to Villach you can stop cars heading to A2 highway. We used sign A2 with Italy flag and after 45 minutes we caught a car to Udine. \\n\\n=== Personal experiences ===\\nIf you are hitching south, from Salzburg to Slovenia for example, and get a ride to Villach, you can try your luck at the blackhole called Rasthof Feistritz and wait something like the usual 3+ hours for a ride, or you could go an extra 5kms to the new Parkplatz/toilet just down the road which recently opened (2018). There is obviously less traffic there, but in one hitchhikers experience/opinion there is way more of a chance to get a ride!\\n\\n\\'\\'In August 2016, on the way to Italy we caught a ride directly to Venice in Villach. It took us 2-3 hours but admittedly we didn\\'t spend the whole time asking around so it\\'s possible it could\\'ve been quicker if we had tried harder. Then on our way back we got rescued after maybe half an hour from a dark, closed gas station and brought to a better spot and then in the early morning we only waited a few minutes before getting a ride to Graz.\\'\\'\\n\\n\\'\\'In July of 2022 on our way from Munich to Ljubljana, we waited 5+ hours at the Maria Gailer bus station before finally getting a direct ride to Ljubljana.\\'\\'\\n\\n\\'\\'in september 2019 I hitchhiked from this town with 0 experience and got a pick to Salzburg easily.\\'\\'\\n\\nDuring the [[Abgefahren hitchhiking race 2010]] some teams had major problems getting away from Villach to Slovenia and from Rasthof Feistritz in particular. Also, the on-ramp Faakersee didn\\'t work well for them. The Villach experience was so traumatizing for some of the teams that they made the new figure of speech \"to have a Villach\" (German \"einen Villach haben\") - if you had a very unlucky or bad day - and now trying to establish this phrase among the [[hitchhikers jargon]].\\n\\nThis was also confirmed on the 2009 University of Sheffield\\'s 1500 mile hitch \\'Bummit to Zadar\\'. Of the three hundred hitch-hikers an unprecedented (for Bummit) sixty two people descended on the bottle neck in Villach during one single night. The ever worsening weather of the mountainous region caused all of the participants to take shelter in the central train station and try and \\'blag\\' a train.

The first option is to take the local train (at the main trainstation; go trough the tunnel on the left to the local train station) to take a train to Tatyanka-Yuzhnaya (Krasnoarmeyskiy region of Volgograd). From there the road to the south is only 600 meters. The train is however only two times a day. The second option is to take a marshrutka to Yubileyniy. It takes you all the way to the south of the city. It stops at a market, maybe you should get off a little bit earlier, but from there you can easily walk to the road. Ask for \\'trassa\\'. There\\'s a big road, with still some local traffic, but getting a car to Astrakhan oblast shouldn\\'t be too hard.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Rostov-on-Don]], [[Ukraine]] ===\\n\\nTake a local train from Volgograd-1 to Surovikino (Суровикино), there are two trains in the morning and they need 3-4 hours, but take you far out of town (140 km) and only cost 120 Roubles (3 Euros). They use old \"platskart\"-wagons and it\\'s usually not crowded at all, so you can just lay down and have a little nap.\\nRight outside of the Surovikino train station, take bus #1 to the very last stop, you can already easily spot the bridge of the main road Volgograd-Rostov from here.\\nDrivers are likely to go all the way to Rostov.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t fancy long train trips, then get off after one hour at Karpovskaya (Карповская), but you will face more local traffic here only going to Kalach-On-Don.\\n\\nWell, if you don\\'t fancy going on train trip at all you can go to the main train station from which you can take marszrutka number 88. It costs 17 rubles and will take you outside the city. You should get out after it exits the city and turns right (after a long time going just straight). It one stop before the last. Then you should come back to the main road. There is a train passage and the cars go very slow and there\\'s a lot of space to pull over so you won\\'t have any problems getting a ride.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Moscow]] ===\\n\\nTake a local train from Volgograd-1 to Kotluban (Котлубань), there are two trains in the morning and both take about one hour. It takes you about 40 km out of town for the price of 48 Roubles (1,20€) and the station is just 300 meters from the main road to Moscow.\\n\\nAlternatively, take a bus or mini-bus from the center towards Gorodishzhe (Городище) and get off at the METRO shopping center (ТЦ МЕТРО).\\n\\n=== North towards [[Saratov]], [[Samara]] ===\\nTake a subway tram in the center of the city (the old tram, not the new model, because the old one is going to the direction you need) to the last stop (Traktornaya pasazhirskaya). You need to find round about at Opolchenskaya street. It\\'s only one on that street, so check it on google maps how to get there through smaller streets. From there, take a bus number 298 to Yerzhovka. Get out of the bus before it goes to the city, stay on the road which is going around the city and HH from there towards north.\\n\\nIf you have difficulties to find round about at Opolchenskaya street, just ask people where is the bus station for village Yerzhovka and they will tell you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n{{IsIn|Russia}}\\n\\n\\n\\n[[Category:Russia]]\\n\\n[[ru:Волгоград]]',\n",

There you can get in the bus 713 and get off at ''Mory'' (The first stop on public transport zone 2 (''strefa II'')).

After, you cross the road and arrive at the on-ramp described under ''#1''. The whole walk is around 1,5km.\\n\\nYou can take the trains from platform #3 at ''Warszawa Śródmieście'' which is next to the Central Station\\n\\n====Option 4, S2 bus stop on the entry to bypass from southern part of the city==== \\n{{Coords|52.1398|21.0161}}<br>\\nTake the bus from metro station ''Wilanowska'' to the stop ''Żołny'' (lines 319, 709, 715, 727, 739). Then go back a bit to the direction you arrived under the overpass and turn left. There is a place where a lot of the southern inhabitants of Warsaw go to A2. There is an unused bus stop on the highway entrance. There is enough space to stop a truck. The drivers will come around the bend, but if you stay at the end of the bus stop they will go slow enough and they will have much time to see you and stop.

Another few hundred meters to the East you will find a bus stop with plenty of space to stop (it's across the street from the church). It's just one lane, cars are going quite slow and you avoid a great deal of local traffic out of Warsaw.

To get there you have two different possibilities:\\n\\nA. Take the tram 8, 10, 26 direction ''Os. Górczewska'' and get off at ''Ciepłownia Wola''. There you can get in the bus 713 and get off at ''Mory'' (The first stop on public transport zone 2 (''strefa II'')). Walk back around 200m in the direction your bus came from, until the on-ramp of the A2 snd hitchike there\\n\\nB.  Especially during rush hour, there is a faster way to get to the on-ramp at the A2: Take the ''KM3'' train in direction of [[Łowicz]] or [[Sochaczew]] (sometimes only going to [[Błonie]]) and get of at the station ''Gołąbki''. From the pedestrian crossing over the tracks you can already spot the highway's noise barrier to the north-west. Follow the road on the northern side of the train station to the north, turn right at the next crossing and the road should lead you through an under-bridge under the highway after a couple of minutes. After, you cross the road and arrive at the on-ramp described under ''#1''. The whole walk is around 1,5km.\\n\\nYou can take the trains from platform #3 at ''Warszawa Śródmieście'' which is next to the Central Station\\n\\n====Option 4, S2 bus stop on the entry to bypass from southern part of the city==== \\n{{Coords|52.1398|21.0161}}<br>\\nTake the bus from metro station ''Wilanowska'' to the stop ''Żołny'' (lines 319, 709, 715, 727, 739). Then go back a bit to the direction you arrived under the overpass and turn left. There is a place where a lot of the southern inhabitants of Warsaw go to A2. There is an unused bus stop on the highway entrance. There is enough space to stop a truck. The drivers will come around the bend, but if you stay at the end of the bus stop they will go slow enough and they will have much time to see you and stop. It is a great place to catch direct car to [[Łódź]], to [[Poznań]] or even [[Gdańsk]] you can change on the service station (MOP) ''Nowosady'' (there are Burger King and Shell gas station), if the driver comes to Łódź and you want to go west or north it is important to left before A1 and A2 junction.\\n\\n====Option 5, National road 92 slower option==== \\n{{Coords|52.2103|20.7997}}<br>\\nIf you wish to take the old main road DK92 (not advisable if you want to travel fast...) you can use a place which takes a bit more time to reach:\\n\\nTake the ''KM3'' train in direction of [[Łowicz]] or [[Sochaczew]] and get out at ''Ożarów Mazowiecki''. \\n\\nWhen you get out at the station in ''Ożarów Mazowiecki'' (make sure you keep an eye out for the correct station, Ożarów Mazowiecki only has one sign at the end of the station) just leave the station to the right (facing away from Warsaw) and follow ''Marii Konopnickiej'' Street until you reach a bigger street, ''Poznańska'' (about 500m). Another few hundred meters to the East you will find a bus stop with plenty of space to stop (it's across the street from the church). It's just one lane, cars are going quite slow and you avoid a great deal of local traffic out of Warsaw. Even though this is the old main road to the West and some drivers (especially trucks) take it to avoid the highway fees, it will probably take longer than using the highway.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Radom]], [[Kielce]], [[Kraków]] {{National Road Number Poland|7}} {{E|77}} ===\\n{{Coords|52.1394|20.9018}}<br>\\nGet tram 7, 9, 35 from the city centre e.g ''Aleje Jerozolimskie'', ''Warszawa Centralna'' (Main Train Station), ''Centrum'' (Warsaw Metro station) going in the direction of ''P+R Aleja Krakowska'' and get off at the last stop.

Start hitchhiking on Wroclawska street for example at \"Bielany Wr. - MAKRO\" bus station.\\nFor this option taking train from Wroclaw main station to \"Bielany Wroclawskie\" could be convenient.\\n\\n==== Warning for option 2 and 3 ====\\nIn case of getting a lift which will be crossing going by any other place than Kudowa Zdroj, \\'\\'\\'do not\\'\\'\\' take it (only if you can drive directly to Prague or Hradec Kralove). All other roads (as Miedzylesie - Mladkovske sedlo) are pretty dead and you might find it very difficult to get a lift in there.\\n\\n== Hitching in ==\\n\\nThere are a few different highways that circle around Wroclaw. If your driver isn\\'t travelling directly to Wroclaw, it is unlikely that they will take you to the centre because it is a rather large diversion for them. \\n\\nIf you\\'re coming either from Kraków or from Germany along the A4 motorway ask your driver to drop you off at Bielany Orlen petrol station. From there you can take a bus 612 to Wrocław main railway station. The last bus leaves at 22.14 Monday till Sunday and the bus stop is located on Wrocławska Street south of the motorway, next to Hotel Bielany.\\n\\nIf you\\'re going along the A8, ask the driver to let you out at the airport.

Otherwise you might get stuck in some very bad spot with only local traffic.\\n\\n=== Northeast towards [[Łódź]], [[Warsaw|Warszawa]] {{National Road Number Poland|8}} {{E|67}} ===\\n\\n\\n==== Option 1: Opposite \"Wroclaw Psie Pole\" train station ====\\n\\nUse [https://jakdojade.pl/wroclaw/trasa/ website] to find the connection with Wroclaw Psie Pole Train Station.\\nStart hitching on the opposite side of the road to the train station. There is bus stop so you can hitchhike there just before the bus stop.\\n\\n==== Option 2: \"Wroclaw Lotnisko\" A8 motorway exit ====\\n\\nIn the west of the city you can find a roundabout in Graniczna street where it meets with Plaska street, just before the S8. There is a shopping centre nearby. You can stand in the exit of the roundabout with a Warszawa sign. There is just enough place for the cars to stop, and they are going very slow, so they can see you easily.\\n\\n==== Option 3: \"Wroclaw Polnoc\" A8 motorway exit ====\\n\\nUse the spot North towards Poznan, Bydgosz from this website.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Poznań]], [[Bydgoszcz]] {{National Road Number Poland|5}} {{E|261}} ===\\n==== \"Wroclaw Polnoc\" A8 motorway exit ====\\n\\n[[File:Wroclav-Poznan.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[User:Rafkoo|Rafkoo]] hitching out towards Poznan]]\\nHitchhiking spot: bus stop of bus 908.

Then walk west about 3 km where road 94 joins. Or take bus 938 948 to Żar.\\n=== South towards [[Prague]] ([[Czech Republic|CZ]])  ===\\n\\n==== Option 1: \"Bielany Wroclawskie\" A4 motorway exit with Orlen petrol station on the spot {{Apl|4}} {{E|40}} -> {{National Road Number Poland|5}} {{E|65}} ====\\nIt is exactly the same spot as going \"West towards Berlin, Dresden\" so follow instructions above. You need to enter A4 motorway in direction West and exit it on \"Kostomloty\" exit towards Lubawka (PL / CZ) border crossing {{National Road Number Poland|5}} (it is about ~30km after entering it). All cars that go west fit you, you just need to ask driver to drop you off at that exit so that you can go {{National Road Number Poland|5}} .\\n\\n==== Option 2 (via [[Kłodzko]]): Magnice village {{National Road Number Poland|8}} {{E|67}} ====\\nTake the bus to the village Magnice. There is direct bus number 862 from main train station (Dworzec PKP (Sucha)) and it costs 4,50 zloty but it goes not so often (once per hour) so it is better to check timetable in advance [https://www.marcopolo.pl/transport-miejski-kobierzyce timetables]. Hitchhike on the bus stop that you get off at. This spot is straight after the roundabout, so cars go slowly. All the traffic from A8 motorway towards Kudowa-Zdroj (PL / CZ) border crossing goes through this point. \\n\\nUse [https://jakdojade.pl/wroclaw/trasa/ website] to find bus connection with Magnice.\\n\\n862 - direct bus from main train station\\n\\nAnother option is train to Kobierzyce. It takes you to the same route but a little bit further. From \"Kobierzyce\" train station it is 900m walk to {{National Road Number Poland|8}}.\\n\\n==== Option 3 (via [[Kłodzko]]): \"Wroclawska\" street in Bielany Wroclawskie {{National Road Number Poland|8}} {{E|67}} ====\\n\\nGo to Bielany Wroclawskie (follow instruction for going east or west from this website). Start hitchhiking on Wroclawska street for example at \"Bielany Wr. - MAKRO\" bus station.\\nFor this option taking train from Wroclaw main station to \"Bielany Wroclawskie\" could be convenient.\\n\\n==== Warning for option 2 and 3 ====\\nIn case of getting a lift which will be crossing going by any other place than Kudowa Zdroj, \\'\\'\\'do not\\'\\'\\' take it (only if you can drive directly to Prague or Hradec Kralove). All other roads (as Miedzylesie - Mladkovske sedlo) are pretty dead and you might find it very difficult to get a lift in there.\\n\\n== Hitching in ==\\n\\nThere are a few different highways that circle around Wroclaw. If your driver isn\\'t travelling directly to Wroclaw, it is unlikely that they will take you to the centre because it is a rather large diversion for them. \\n\\nIf you\\'re coming either from Kraków or from Germany along the A4 motorway ask your driver to drop you off at Bielany Orlen petrol station. From there you can take a bus 612 to Wrocław main railway station. The last bus leaves at 22.14 Monday till Sunday and the bus stop is located on Wrocławska Street south of the motorway, next to Hotel Bielany.\\n\\nIf you\\'re going along the A8, ask the driver to let you out at the airport.

Dez. 2015)\\n|state = Bavaria\\n|plate = WÜ\\n|motorways = [[A3 (Germany)|A3]], [[A7 (Germany)|A7]], [[A81 (Germany)|A81]]\\n}}\\n\\'\\'\\'Würzburg\\'\\'\\' is a city located in the North West of the [[Germany|German]] \\'\\'Bundesland\\'\\' [[Bavaria]].\\n\\nThe city is located along the River Main and is historically an important traffic hub with 3 highways.\\n\\n== Hitching in ==\\nIf you\\'re coming from the [[A3 (Germany)|A3]], get out at the \\'\\'Raststätte Würzburg\\'\\' (service station). From there it\\'s just a 10 minutes walk to the S-train at the \\'\\'Berner Strasse\\'\\' in the borough \\'\\'Heuchelhof\\'\\'. It\\'s also just a 1 hour walk into the city center.\\n\\nIf you\\'re coming from the [[A7 (Germany)|A7]], get out at the ramp \\'\\'Würzburg/Lengfeld\\'\\'. It seems that there is enough space for cars to stop.\\n\\n== Hitching out ==\\n\\n=== East towards [[Nürnberg]] ===\\n* For hitching out, take tram 3 or 5 towards \\'\\'Berner Straße\\'\\' (Direction Heuchelhof or Rottenbauer). From there you can walk towards the service station along the [[A3 (Germany)|A3]] called \\'\\'Raststätte Würzburg Süd\\'\\'. When you get off the tram there is a road called \"Straßburger Ring\" on the left. Follow the road (it makes a ring, that\\'s why it\\'s called so) and then turn on the left again in a street called \"Londoner Straße\". Turn directly right and keep walking straight (yes also hit the field path) until you reach the gas station. This is the safest bet, but from certain parts of the city it can take a long time to reach this point. \\n\\n* Another option would be taking one of various busses going from the central bus station to the bus stop \"Europastern\". There are two petrol stations nearby (OMV and Shell) where you can ask people or just put your thumb up. Most of the people are going north at the A7 or east towards Nürnberg on the A3.\\n\\n* Take the bus 554/55 out towards \"Frickenhausen\". Before reaching \"Eibelstadt\" you will pass under the A3. Get out here and you will see the ramp to the A3 on the left. There is a few places to pull in on the ramp.  \\n\\n* *UPDATE- March 2018* The service station \\'Raststätte Würzburg Süd\\' is currently closed as part of ongoing construction on the A3.\\n\\n=== West towards [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] ===\\n* There used to be a connection beetween the two service stations along the [[A3 (Germany)|A3]] but due to construction works there is none anymore. So if you want to go to the northern service station which leads towards West, this would be the best way to get there: take tram 3 or 5 towards \"Reuterstraße\" and then take bus nr. 33 to the bus stop \"Bremenweg\". From there follow the road 200 metres and then go right up the hill on the road \"Unterer Kaulweg\". Another 400 metres further up there is road leading leftwards directly to the service station.\\n\\nDue to the ungoing construction works service station Würzburg Nord will be closed until June 2018.\\n\\n* An alternative is using the \\'\\'B19\\'\\', the arterial road, leading to the highway. However DO NOT just walk on there and try to find a place along the road, there is NO place where cars could possibly stop. Rather use one of the crossings that lead onto the \\'\\'B19\\'\\', for example the linkage with the \\'\\'Rottendorfer Straße\\'\\'. I personally have had surprising success there, using a sign saying \"A3\" and finding a lift to the highway, where you can just stand on the actual ramp.\\n\\nIf you go towards Stuttgart, both sides of the highway works, but going towards west is more of a logical choice as a lot less people are coming from west to go Stuttgart than the opposite.\\n\\n=== North towards [[A7 (Germany)|A7]] ===\\n* Take bus nr. 14 from the central bus station to the bus stop \"Annastraße\" and walk 200 m until you reach the big junction crossing the \"B19\". Go across and a couple of metres to the left, you will find some parking lots and ramps which provide enough space for cars to stop. Due to the traffic lights it is easy for cars to spot you.\\n\\n* Another option would be taking one of various busses going from the central bus station to the bus stop \"Europastern\". There are two petrol stations nearby (OMV and Shell) where you can ask people or just put your thumb up. Most of the people are going north at the A7 or east towards Nürnberg at the A3.\\n\\nIf your lift takes another highway splitting from the A7 (e.g. A70, A71) or the other way round, the best option might be the first service station called \"Riedener Wald\".\\n\\n=== South towards [[A7 (Germany)|A7]] ===\\n\\n* One option is to take a regional train from Würzburg main station to Dettelbach Bahnhof, which is just ten minutes away. From there, you have to walk 40-60 minutes to the A7 ramp crossing the B8 (instead of walking, you could also take a bus (line 8101) to Bibelried). There is enough place for cars to stop. The next service station on the A7 south of Würzburg is Ohrenbach West.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n{{hitchbase_city|58}}\\n\\n[[Category:Bavaria]]\\n[[Category:E45]]\\n[[Category:E43]]\\n[[Category:Germany]]\\n\\n[[de:Würzburg]]',\n",

To access this Hwy, travel westbound on Hwy #16 to just west of [[Stony Plain]], and then take the Hwy 43 exit ramp North.  There is a turnout within 1km of this junction that offers an ideal place to hitchhike from.  Hwy 43 is the main truck route, and so your odds of being picked up by a big rig that is going all the way up to Yellowknife is high.  Carry a sign that says NWT or Yellowknife to better your odds of a lift.\\n\\nTo get from Edmonton to Stony Plain, try hitching with a sign, or taking the greyhound as it is a very short trip, but can sometimes be tricky getting out of Edmonton.  \\n\\nOnce Northbound on Hwy 43, you will eventually hit the town of [[Valleyview]] which is where the highway forks, and you can either continue North-West on what is the [[Alaska Highway]] or North on the [[Mackenzie Highway]].  The most direct route to Yellowknife is via the \"Mackenzie Highway\".\\n\\nIf hitching in the summer, be prepared for swarms of black flies, horseflies and mosquitoes, as well be aware that there are many black bears in the area and it is not uncommon to see them.  It is not recommended to opt for rides that will drop you off on a desolte stretch of highway, its safer to start and end legs of your trips in communities or at the very least, near a gas station.  There are a handful of stretches where there are no communities or gas stations for several hundred km\\'s, and these are terrible areas to be stranded.  Be sure to carry adequate food, water and a tent/sleeping bag.\\n\\nAlso, for summer travelers, be aware that there is a ferry crossing at the [[Mackenzie River]], roughly 315km south of Yellowknife.  There is no cost for the ferry, and it runs from 6am - Midnight seven days a week.  If traveling Northbound, the last ferry crossing is at 11:30pm, and if traveling south, 11:45pm.\\n\\n[[Category:City\\'s]]\\n[[Category:Canada]]\\n[[Category:Northwest Territories]]\\n{{IsIn|Northwest Territories}}',\n",

It seemed to me that those are not only for the safety of tourists, but also for more control of the government about what foreigners are allowed to see. (There are some tribes that do not accept the government, but the government isn't very nice to them either -- it is better not to get in between, check the current situation when you get there about which areas are no-go). Army check points that control for guns and your permits could be seen as the metro stations of Yemen (as service stations are on German highways, you jump from one to the other). The guys there have been very friendly to me and also helped me to organised lifts for my onward journey. However, sometimes I found it personally to much of a hassle as they are not very used to this, so I recommend just to organise your lift at other places and cross those points in a car (when the situations allows it). It is helpful to have some knowledge of Arabic, but I think it is not obligatory for getting around. Payment for the lift is generally expected, but this will be agreed on in the beginning of the journey (when you decide to use this car). On the main routes I turned those lifts down as there is enough traffic on the streets.

There are many small nearby islands which can be reached by a hitchhiking a boat. \\n\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n\\n=== South [[Šibenik]], [[Split]] ===\\n\\nFrom the central Bus station you will have to walk 1 km  the Ante Starcevića until there is a really big cross. Then you turn right on to the Jadranska cesta. This road is heading to Šibenik and Split. After 200 m you will find a bus stop where you can place yourself. Landscape on the coastal road is much more beautiful.\\n\\n\\n\\n=== East & North [[Zagreb]], [[Rijeka]] ===\\n\\nThe main highway starts about 10 km away, therefore if someone offers to take you there, it's best to agree. From there, if you want to go to Zagreb, go to the péage (cestarina). There are two ways to Rijeka, one of them is the same highway, the other is along the coast. \\n\\n\\n'''Option 1'''\\n\\nThe street is named Zagrebačka ulica and can be easily reached by walking straight up East (leaving the sea behind) from the main bus station on Anta Starcevića or taking buses 4 or 6 from there (be sure you get into the one going the right direction! There are two bus stops on the same side of the street across the bus station, and you want the one on the East side; when not sure, ask the driver if they are going towards Supernova shopping mall, otherwise you might end up taking a long tour around Zadar). For bus 6, you want to get out at Supernova and go back to the main road (just on the side of the mall), there is a bus stop there. For bus 4, get out at Crno (the first stop when it goes out of the Zagrebačka) and get back to the road, there is a bus stop, as well. No shade, so have water to survive Balkan summer heat.\\n\\n'''Option 2'''\\n\\nStand at/around the INA gas station on Zagrebačka, right before Ul Antuna Dobronića. You can catch both the passing traffic and ask around the gas station. You can walk there from the old town in around 45 mins. \\n\\n\\n== Sleeping ==\\n\\nThere is an abandoned campground at the end of Karma road Kkarma ulika). Just next to Tequila Sunrise Cafe. Locals go there to swim during the day. People sometimes pitch their tents for a few days. Also you can find some more private spot right before the Sunrise cafe in the Olive Garden. Please leave the place clean as there was a lot of trash last time we were there and the spot is really nice. Here is geo location (44.0962027, 15.2480287)\\n\\nPlease DON'T do it south of the city, there are areas left which are contaminated with landmines.\\n\\n[[File:Zadar.jpg|thumb|left|Old town of Zadar]]\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n[[de:Zadar]]\",\n",

Savski most a bus terminal where you can catch buses #111 or #132. These buses pass by the pay tolls \"Lučko\". Get off after 15 minutes of ride at bus stop  Put Za Leskovac . You can recognise a big restaurant \"Calypso\". Once you get off you will see that one road goes over the bridge - take the other road that doesn\\'t go over the bridge, take first left and go through the parking lot and voila! you\\'re there. \\n\\nAlso if you walk a bit highway forward you get on the Crodux petrol station. There is less traffic than on tolls.\\n\\nIf you are going to \\'\\'Dalmatia\\'\\' (Zadar, Split, etc.) don\\'t take rides to Rijeka because it is a bit out of your way. Car plates for each city: Pula and Istria (PU), Rijeka (RI) Zadar (ZD) Šibenik (ŠI) Split (ST).\\n\\n*\\'\\' I followed the instructions about the bus to go to the Lucko toll station. The bus driver was very frıendly and explained me where to get off. From the busstop towards the toll station is 10 minutes walk. I first tried at the toll station for one hour with no luck. Then I changed strategy and I walked towards the first petrol station behind the toll station. Here you can find more shade facilities and cleaner air. Also you are able to talk to drivers. Most of the cars where tourısts with no space left. It took me 3 hours to fınd a direct ride to Split. But it was worth it. Although there is less traffic at the petrol station I believe it is a better option than the toll station. Good Luck. May 2012. Len \\'\\'\\n\\n*\" I\\'m always lucky with this spot, no matter where I am heading. I wait about 5-10 minutes when going to Rijeka and about 20-30 when going to Zadar, Šibenik or Split. But then again, I\\'m a girl. HAVE A SIGN with car plates of the city you\\'re going to. December 2012, Nina_Unexia \"\\n\\n*\" July 2015: spot worked well. There\\'s a lot of police around, but they seemed not to care at all. Be careful of getting dropped on one of the rest areas though, there are quite many so traffic isn\\'t very heavy on each one, and in the summertime almost all traffic is fully loaded vacation cars heading for the coast. The best rest stop before the highway split at Bosiljevo is probably Draganic, as it has both a Burger King and a Marche Bistro. We were stuck at Vukova Gorica rest area for hours.\"\\n\\n*\" Even though the ticket inspectors are more common now and the bus drivers control if you have the ticket, these buses (#111 and #132) are almost always crowded so you can still sneak in without buying a ticket. April 2014, Nina_Unexia \"\\n\\n*\" You can skip the bus part - just exit the tram (14 or 7) on \"Jadranska avenija\" which is the name of the street in which you will get after crossing the bridge and following a small road going east (with some bigger shops on your right), you can hitch on the spot where the small street is flowing into the big one, the cars go fast but there is space - even a truck. If they\\'re not going your way, just ask to be dropped at the pay toll. Great place for finding long rides. --[[User:Uyku.tulumu|Uyku.tulumu]] ([[User talk:Uyku.tulumu|talk]]) 18:38, 15 March 2013 (CET) \"\\n\\nFurther to the above directions, you\\'ll stay on tram 14 until it\\'s crossed the river, then find yourself on the lower level of a motorway roundabout junction.  You have several possible exits under bridges.  When you get off the tram with the river to your back, go right.  You\\'ll see a Billa supermarket and a McD\\'s.  There is a slip road there with a decent dirt layby where cars can pull in.  Have a sign that reads \\'LUCKO\\' and you\\'ll easily get a lift to the toll station five minutes up the road.  From there it\\'s easy pickings.  --[[User:Looking for Stu|Looking for Stu]] ([[User talk:Looking for Stu|talk]]) 10:42, 14 May 2013 (CEST)\\n\\n*\" July 2017 : I were in this spot and i have some advices . Really really really avoid WEEKENDS ! I were there a saturday and the jam were incredible with cars and vans full of people and staffs from many europenas countries heading to croitian costs. I didn\\'t found a problem for the stop of the bus because we were 10 or 12 people( all locals except me) heading to split and other destinations. I waited maybe 2 or 3 hours in a very hot day , so i went to the petrol station 200 metres from the poll station to refresh , and some local news catch me for interview xD . My ride was fun because both of us spoke about sports and football ;)) . he was nice and ride me to Zadar poll station, so i took another stop from there to the bus station (10 minutes) . Good luck and from my personal opinion ovoid weekend guys !\\n\\n=== Direction [[Osijek, Slavonski Brod]], [[Belgrade]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] ===\\n__TOC__\\nTHEY MOVED TOLL STATION 8KM TOWARDS EAST, so going to Dumovec is no longer a good option. Get on a bus #216 or #276 from Kvaternikov trg and get off at a stop called \\'\\'Ivanjorečka pošta\\'\\' (post office in Ivanja Reka), cross the street and follow the road going on the right, it\\'s called \\'\\'Rimski put\\'\\', it will take you straight to Tifon petrol station. There you can ask drivers to take you to the toll station (in croatian: naplatne kućice) or hitch on the road.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'THE BEST OPTION\\'\\' to Serbia and Hungary\\'\\nI was hitchhiking around 10 times from this spot and always got a ride within a minute or two. Take a bus 216 or 276 from Kvaternikov trg to Ivanja reka. After about 25 minutes of ride, you should see a small church on your right side (https://goo.gl/maps/pwcr0). Get off the bus, walk back to the church and turn right. This street is going directly to the entrance of the highway. You have to walk around 5 minutes and you will see an intersection with a traffic light (https://goo.gl/maps/doL7v). Ask drivers at traffic light to take you to the toll gate Ivanja Reka which is now farther than it used to be before, but don\\'t worry. Same HH spot if you are going north towards Budapest, just ask people if they are going to the north toll gate. (by [[User:NixyJungle|NixyJungle]])\\n\\nYou have three options for these destinations. \\n* First option is outdated and deleted. Look up for updated version.\\n* Second option is to get the tram #2, #3 or #13 to \\'\\'Savišće\\'\\' or \\'\\'Žitnjak\\'\\'. Get out at the last stop and then walk for about 15 minutes towards the motorway. On the motorway you\\'ll find a bus stop and there you can easily hitchhike towards the on-ramp in \\'\\'Ivanja Reka\\'\\' or you can even stop cars who are going to Belgrade or Bosnia. Ask the locals for extra tips and explanations.\\n: \\n- [[User:Chillion|Chillion]] (2018) This method is good. About 5-10mins before the bus stops (there are two on the same Street), is a church where you can fill up your water bottles at the tap inside the church yard. When I hitched from the bus stop I had both \"Slavonska Brod\"  and \"Ivanja Reka\" signs. After using both, the latter sign got me a ride in 5 mins, taking me to the town of Ivanja, where I was dropped off on the highway in the direction of Serbia. Got to Serbia that same day (1 car and 2 truck rides).\\n\\n\\'\\'[[User:nuclearphyllis|Nuclearphyllis]]\\' local experts took him to the first toll station on the Zagreb-Belgrade motorway, even though it was illegal to hitchhike from there. They weren\\'t troubled and got a ride within 10 minutes.\\'\\'\\n* Third option, go to Savski most and get on IKEA bus. It will take you to IKEA, and this is right on the highway to Belgrade, next to Dumovec. This bus ticket costs 10 kuna and you can use 5 kuna discount in IKEA for food or coffee. \\nBus leaves Savski most station at Mon-Sat: 9:00, 10:00, 12:00, 14:00, 16:00, 18:00\\nSun: 9:00, 10:00, 12:00, 14:00, 16:00\\nHere are the stops:\\nhttp://www.ikea.com/ms/hr_HR/about_store/ikea_bus.html?icid=hr%7Citl%7Chpl%7Ctxt_link_bus_line\\n\\n*I hitched 3 times in direction of Belgrade, so just one tip - if the car that is giving you a ride goes to Slavonski Brod (half way before Belgrade) ask him to drop you off at EAST EXIT of the city. in Croatian - ISTOČNI IZLAZ. because, if he drops you off at west exit, 95% of cars go to direction of Zagreb, I waited there 2 hours once, and the second time 3 hours ;)\\n\\nI could just add if you need to go from Zagreb to Osijek on high way A3 and a lot of cars are driving forward to Slavonski Brod Belgrade. You need to go out on turn to Đakovo and Osijek(high way A5). Than you walk right to high way and just climb up till turning for Osijek direction and hitchhike there at the beginning, cars need to slow down when they join to high way that leads to Osijek. If driver left you after Đakovo on some rest place near high way, try not to stuck up or avoid that.  Because on this high way in one hour maybe 15 cars passed by, so it is not so crowded with cars even that is main high way, try to catch ride directly to Osijek. People probably do not use often this high way becaue you must pay fee for driving there and normal road is free.\\n\\n=== Direction [[Budapest]], [[Varazdin]] and [[Cakovec]] ===\\n(Read below, this one doesn\\'t exist anymore! The best option is on the bottom - to HH on Slavonska avenija ) Take bus number 216 from Kvaternikov trg to the last stop in Ivanja Reka or bus 276 till 2 stations before the final station. Ask for the church in Ivanja Reka, people will know it, you should get out there. There will be a small road which leads to the on ramp, ask people for which one it is. You should walk till the traffic lights, the turn right and you already see the place. After the lights you should walk about 300 meters and you can start hitching there with a sign VZ for example. Works like a charm, someone waited there for less than 10 minutes.<br />\\n[[User:NixyJungle|NixyJungle]] edit: No need to walk 300 meters after traffic lights. You can ask people on the traffic light. It\\'s easier and more safe, plus, if the police comes, you are legal, because sign for the beginning of the highway and forbidden hitchhiking is 200 meters after the traffic light.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Update\\'\\'\\': This place doesn\\'t exist anymore, as the new road was built and there\\'s no stopping lane, so cars can\\'t stop to pick you up. Don\\'t hitchhike here.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Update - april 2012\\'\\'\\': There is able to hitchhike there, last year I was there, but it is \\'\\'\\'very hard to get out of there\\'\\'\\'. You need reach \\'\\'petrol station\\'\\' and the exit from station has got long shoulder where U can safely try to cach someone.\\n\\nThree problems:\\n#90% of cars which stop are those which leave the station.\\n#From those who stops almost everyone was local people.\\n#It was my one of the longest stops (no less than 3 houers).\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Update\\'\\'\\': The main problem with direction towards Hungary is that pay tolls are quite far away from Zagreb, so it would be easier if you first get to the pay tolls. The best starting point is the \"Tifon\" petrol station as it\\'s the furthest hitchhiking spot on the way to Varaždin and Budapest you can get to by public transportation (directions to there are already described in the directions to Belgrade section on the top of this topic - bus 216 or 176 from Kvaternikov trg...) and hold a sign \"ZELINA\" (the closest town to the pay tolls) or \"SV. HELENA\" (the exact name of that pay tolls). Many drivers get off the highway just before the pay tolls, so maybe you\\'ll have to walk a few kilometers. But once you\\'re there, you can easily get a ride straight to Budapest.\\n\\nSecond option is to hitchhike on Slavonska avenija, this way you dont have to take any public transportation. You can stand after the crossroad of Slavonska avenija and Ulica Josipa Marohnića. Many people go towards the highway on this road. We hitchhiked with the sign \"Sesvete\", got a ride in 15 mins and got dropped at the petrol station right in front of highway ramps in Ivanja Reka. From here we hitchhiked with sign \"Varazdin\" and got a ride in 15-20 mins and got dropped at the pay tolls towards north.\\n\\nNote: this (the crossing of Slavonska avenija and Ul. Ulica Josipa Marohnića) seems to be the best and easiest option. Many cars in the direction, there\\'re traffic lights + lot of space for cars to stop. From the central square (Trg bana Josipa Jelačića) you can either walk (southwards, 3km) or take trams 14 (direction ZAPRUĐE) or 17 (direction BORONGAJ)  for 15mins till the stop Vjesnik. The stop is near the crossing of Savska cesta and Slavonska avenija, so you have to walk 10min till the spot where Ul. Ulica Josipa Marohnića is. You can hold sign VŽ (Varaždin). Once you get a ride and are on the highway, be sure to get off at the first petrol station (OMV, some 20kms from the starting point), because it\\'s also the last one before Varaždin!\\n\\n[[User:Gallar|Gallar]] hitch-hiked (with girlfriend) from crossroad of Slavonska avenija and Ulica Josipa Marohnića and he waited 9 hours just for a single lift to mentioned OMV station. It might be bad luck, but be aware there is no better place to hike and yet this one might be not so perfect.\\n\\nNote: This can\\'t be a good hitchhiking spot by any reason as it\\'s too much inside the town and there\\'s too much of local traffic, also there are more cars coming to Zagreb from the west than those departing to the east. However, it\\'s not impossible, but getting a lift there in a normal time is more about the luck...\\n\\nUpdate: I think the best spot to hitchhike from is the gas station on Slavonska avenija 110, you can get there by taking 286 bus and walking for like 15 mins, even though it\\'s like 40 mins from the city centre but there is plenty of room to stop, also I dont recommend going to Varazdin and hoping to get a ride at the toll booth going to the highway because the traffic is pretty small there and mainly not towards budapest. There is a gas station before Varazdin(like 10 km) and we got a ride from there in like 5 mins.\\n\\nJune 2019\\n\\nAnother good option is to take the tram until Dubec.  At least 3 different lines end there.  Once you get there look for a bus going to Sesvete.  There will most likely be many people trying to board and you should be able to enter from any door.  The ride shouldn’t take more then 10 minutes and you will find it makes a left turn followed by two right turns soon after.  This is where you want to get off and cross the street. (Veraždinska cesta; bus stop Selčina) The bus stop on this side is slightly further up the road. You will then want bus 273 going to Lužan. (Someone entered this bus from the middle door as well.)  Take bus 273 to the end of the line.  From here it is just a 3.2 kilometer walk to the first gas station directly on the highway.  There is a gravel road after you cross over the highway which you can easily reach by going a couple hundred meters past the highway.  (No need to try and cross the ditch to reach it.) As you approach the gas station fence and the road turns to lead around the back you will see a gap where you can easily hop the fence and follow a well formed path directly to the parking lot.  It should be just a handful of meters after the curve and very easy to notice.\\n\\nThere are also plenty of good places where one can pitch a tent for the night if one wants to come out here in the evening and get a nice and early start the following morning.\\n\\n=== Direction [[Ljubljana]], [[Austria]], [[Novo Mesto]] ===\\n\\'\\'\\'From town\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nTake tram #5 or #17 from the centre of Zagreb towards the \\'\\'Precko\\'\\'. Notice that the ride takes a lot of time, 45 minutes at least. In \\'\\'Precko\\'\\', exit the tram and walk left. You\\'ll see a street that turns right. Take this street and walk 5 minutes till you get to the main street \\'\\'Ljubljanska Avenija\\'\\' (also called \\'\\'Zagrebacka Avenija\\'\\'). Cross this street in front of the \\'\\'Konzum\\'\\' supermarket and turn left. You will see a small bus station, this is your spot. However most people commute from this point. Best is to hitchhike from there with a SLO sign. Don\\'t take rides that don\\'t take you at least to the border - There is no good places to hitchhike further down the road. From the border crossing itself it\\'s relatively easy to get a good ride, even as far as to Austria.\\n\\nOn a [[Good times to hitchhike|Sunday]] Erga and [[User:Guaka|guaka]] waited way to long. Not a single car stopped in two hours time, and at the petrol stations everyone with space pretended not to go anywhere near Slovenia (West or North). Two Belgian guys didn\\'t manage to get a ride in the same period, also trying in different spots in the area ([[User:Guaka|guaka]] somehow convinced the West Gate bus driver to also pick them up). Use the West Gate option if you\\'re simply heading to Austria, find another solution if you\\'re heading towards Ljubljana...\\n\\nAfter more than one hour of waiting, I went further down the road to the next bus stop (in front of FORD car dealer center) where most of the local traffic is gone and I found a ride after 15min.\\n\\n* I recommend following this advice, after going to the Konzum market to get some food and cardboard I spent only 40 mn before someone offered to take me to Slovenia. You are highly visible and this worked at dawn.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'INA Lučko - north\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nINA Lučko - north is a big rest stop just outside Zagreb, and it takes quite a long time to come there from the city center. You have to take a tram to Savski most and then bus line 112 or 168 to Lučko centar. Don\\'t panic when you won\\'t see any shopping center as you expect, this place looks like a village;) from there, you walk for about 2km to reach the stop.\\n\\nIt is good place to hitchhike and locals told me that\\'s where everybody goes. For me it took whole 3.5h to get a pick (december 2019), but it was one day before christmas, so the place was deserted. I got a direct ride to Ljubljana after all, so i can recommend.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Take a bus to the highway\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nThis option takes you a bit longer to get started with (nearly an hour), it takes you directly to the highway though.\\n\\n== Much better option to Slovenia ==\\nTake a bus number 112 from \"Savski most\" bus station. Get of the bus at the last station. You should see highway from that place. If you don\\'t, ask for the direction. Above highway you will see an overpass. Go to the opposite side and hitchhike there at the entrance of the road. There is a petrol station with many cars entering the highway. If it\\'s easier for you, it is a place called Motel Plitvice and it\\'s here https://goo.gl/maps/eM865 (by [[User:NixyJungle|NixyJungle]])\\n\\nCaution: On a Sunday check the [http://www.zet.t-com.hr/media/144255/112nnn.pdf schedule for bus 112], since it does not depart very frequently that day - [[User:Questrayer|Questrayer]] had to wait for about 80 minutes. Apart from that, this option is very good, and he got a ride all the way to Ljubljana within 15 minutes approaching people at the petrol station.  \\n\\n=== North, direction [[Maribor]], [[Graz]], [[Vienna]] ===\\n==== First option ====\\nFrom the Črnomerec and Ljubljanica bus terminal there\\'s a free bus (red or white colour) to West Gate shopping centre which is adjacent to toll station (check out the West Gate Zagreb page to find out its schedule), see also [http://maps.google.com/?q=zagreb&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=City+of+Zagreb,+Croatia&ll=45.874518,15.829003&spn=0.009815,0.02459&t=h&z=16 Google Maps], the toll station is very close to the shopping center, you can see it from the parking lot where the bus arrives. But you will have to cross a bit of water. Don\\'t try this in the dark. Look for one of the areas with stones covered by metal or just walk about 300 metre in opposite direction of the shopping mall and you will find a little bridge, handy! then come back to the toll station.\\n\\nIf you\\'re heading to [[Slovenia]] or further you\\'ll have to make it to the [[Macelj-Kozminci border crossing]], from where you can easily get rides far into [[Germany]].\\n\\nYou better forget about trying the Precko option (towards Ljubljana), Erga and [[User:Guaka|guaka]] waited for about 2 hours, asking people, with signs (\\'\\'Macelj\\'\\', \\'\\'Maribor\\'\\', SLO) and without sign. Fortunately the free bus to the West Gate center also goes from this above spot.\\n\\n[[User:T0ma5|t0ma5]] was hitchhiking here in January 2011 and he got a ride all the way to Vienna in about 20min.\\n\\n[[User:Cro_gavran|Cro_gavran]] tried to hitchhike here in September 2014 but was in just few minutes forced to leave by highway guards. They said that same day they moved out from highway already 5 hitchhikers and called police to arrest two who didnt wanted to leave the highway. If someone else had same experience, please share.\\n\\n[[User:Uncle sam01|uncle_sam01]] hitched a direct ride to Bratislava in about 20 minutes in August 2015. Definitely wouldn\\'t recommend going over the bridge, since the right side is virtually impossible to walk towards the highway (bushes, trees, water, weeds, etc.). In August 2015 there was only a relatively short fence, which was easy to climb over but you must cross the highway, which is obviously not the safest thing to do, but cars go slow and there are no barriers in the middle. No one bothered us, except some maintenance guy in a pick up who was driving by, but we couldn\\'t make out what he was saying and no one from the toll booths told us anything even though they clearly saw us hitching.\\n\\n--[[User:Yeguaerrante|Yeguaerrante]] ([[User talk:Yeguaerrante|talk]]) 13:05, 18 November 2015 (CET) You can\\'t get to the toll station, it\\'s all fenced, i waited on the road after going for the blue small bridge, you will see a bridge that crosses the highway, a car pick me up after 20 min and took me to small town area, was really hard to get into the highway this way because there was a lot of locals not going too far away. \\n\\n--[[User:Duffajfka|Duffajfka]] walked from the shopping centre along D1 in the direction back to Zagreb until the highway ramp to the north. As it\\'s a two lane one with not too dense traffic, he tried to hitchhike from the guardrail with a sign \"Odmorište\" (service area), probably \"Naplatna Postaja\" (toll booth) would be easier. As he has already been inside the fence, he walked to the toll booth. It was quite a hard walk, but probably worth it. Tried to hitch right from the gates but was expelled by the staff few tens of meters behind the booth, where a car to Graz easily stopped in 20 mins. (May 2019)\\n \\nAs alternative, try to get Plitvice petrol station (not to confuse with famous National park!). It is reachable from Lučko trough the village. It is around 3 km walk.\\n\\n==== Second option ====\\n\\nInstead of the seemingly risky toll station, you can also get a bus to King Cross shopping center or simply walk along Ljubljanska avenija until you reach the on-ramp of the highway. The spot is an approach road of a nearby, not very frequented truck park and offers great visibility and space to pull over for bypassing drivers. [[User:Vapaakulkuri|vapaakulkuri]] however still had to wait about two hours to get a ride to the first gas station that is located about 20km down the road.\\n\\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\\n\\n[[trash:Zagreb]] [[nomad:Zagreb]]\\n\\n\\n[[Category:E65]]\\n[[Category:E59]]\\n[[Category:E71]]',\n",

Savski most a bus terminal where you can catch buses #111 or #132. These buses pass by the pay tolls \"Lučko\". Get off after 15 minutes of ride at bus stop  Put Za Leskovac . You can recognise a big restaurant \"Calypso\". Once you get off you will see that one road goes over the bridge - take the other road that doesn\\'t go over the bridge, take first left and go through the parking lot and voila! you\\'re there. \\n\\nAlso if you walk a bit highway forward you get on the Crodux petrol station. There is less traffic than on tolls.\\n\\nIf you are going to \\'\\'Dalmatia\\'\\' (Zadar, Split, etc.) don\\'t take rides to Rijeka because it is a bit out of your way. Car plates for each city: Pula and Istria (PU), Rijeka (RI) Zadar (ZD) Šibenik (ŠI) Split (ST).\\n\\n*\\'\\' I followed the instructions about the bus to go to the Lucko toll station. The bus driver was very frıendly and explained me where to get off. From the busstop towards the toll station is 10 minutes walk. I first tried at the toll station for one hour with no luck. Then I changed strategy and I walked towards the first petrol station behind the toll station. Here you can find more shade facilities and cleaner air. Also you are able to talk to drivers. Most of the cars where tourısts with no space left. It took me 3 hours to fınd a direct ride to Split. But it was worth it. Although there is less traffic at the petrol station I believe it is a better option than the toll station. Good Luck. May 2012. Len \\'\\'\\n\\n*\" I\\'m always lucky with this spot, no matter where I am heading. I wait about 5-10 minutes when going to Rijeka and about 20-30 when going to Zadar, Šibenik or Split. But then again, I\\'m a girl. HAVE A SIGN with car plates of the city you\\'re going to. December 2012, Nina_Unexia \"\\n\\n*\" July 2015: spot worked well. There\\'s a lot of police around, but they seemed not to care at all. Be careful of getting dropped on one of the rest areas though, there are quite many so traffic isn\\'t very heavy on each one, and in the summertime almost all traffic is fully loaded vacation cars heading for the coast. The best rest stop before the highway split at Bosiljevo is probably Draganic, as it has both a Burger King and a Marche Bistro. We were stuck at Vukova Gorica rest area for hours.\"\\n\\n*\" Even though the ticket inspectors are more common now and the bus drivers control if you have the ticket, these buses (#111 and #132) are almost always crowded so you can still sneak in without buying a ticket. April 2014, Nina_Unexia \"\\n\\n*\" You can skip the bus part - just exit the tram (14 or 7) on \"Jadranska avenija\" which is the name of the street in which you will get after crossing the bridge and following a small road going east (with some bigger shops on your right), you can hitch on the spot where the small street is flowing into the big one, the cars go fast but there is space - even a truck. If they\\'re not going your way, just ask to be dropped at the pay toll. Great place for finding long rides. --[[User:Uyku.tulumu|Uyku.tulumu]] ([[User talk:Uyku.tulumu|talk]]) 18:38, 15 March 2013 (CET) \"\\n\\nFurther to the above directions, you\\'ll stay on tram 14 until it\\'s crossed the river, then find yourself on the lower level of a motorway roundabout junction.  You have several possible exits under bridges.  When you get off the tram with the river to your back, go right.  You\\'ll see a Billa supermarket and a McD\\'s.  There is a slip road there with a decent dirt layby where cars can pull in.  Have a sign that reads \\'LUCKO\\' and you\\'ll easily get a lift to the toll station five minutes up the road.  From there it\\'s easy pickings.  --[[User:Looking for Stu|Looking for Stu]] ([[User talk:Looking for Stu|talk]]) 10:42, 14 May 2013 (CEST)\\n\\n*\" July 2017 : I were in this spot and i have some advices . Really really really avoid WEEKENDS ! I were there a saturday and the jam were incredible with cars and vans full of people and staffs from many europenas countries heading to croitian costs. I didn\\'t found a problem for the stop of the bus because we were 10 or 12 people( all locals except me) heading to split and other destinations. I waited maybe 2 or 3 hours in a very hot day , so i went to the petrol station 200 metres from the poll station to refresh , and some local news catch me for interview xD . My ride was fun because both of us spoke about sports and football ;)) . he was nice and ride me to Zadar poll station, so i took another stop from there to the bus station (10 minutes) . Good luck and from my personal opinion ovoid weekend guys !\\n\\n=== Direction [[Osijek, Slavonski Brod]], [[Belgrade]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] ===\\n__TOC__\\nTHEY MOVED TOLL STATION 8KM TOWARDS EAST, so going to Dumovec is no longer a good option. Get on a bus #216 or #276 from Kvaternikov trg and get off at a stop called \\'\\'Ivanjorečka pošta\\'\\' (post office in Ivanja Reka), cross the street and follow the road going on the right, it\\'s called \\'\\'Rimski put\\'\\', it will take you straight to Tifon petrol station. There you can ask drivers to take you to the toll station (in croatian: naplatne kućice) or hitch on the road.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'THE BEST OPTION\\'\\' to Serbia and Hungary\\'\\nI was hitchhiking around 10 times from this spot and always got a ride within a minute or two. Take a bus 216 or 276 from Kvaternikov trg to Ivanja reka. After about 25 minutes of ride, you should see a small church on your right side (https://goo.gl/maps/pwcr0). Get off the bus, walk back to the church and turn right. This street is going directly to the entrance of the highway. You have to walk around 5 minutes and you will see an intersection with a traffic light (https://goo.gl/maps/doL7v). Ask drivers at traffic light to take you to the toll gate Ivanja Reka which is now farther than it used to be before, but don\\'t worry. Same HH spot if you are going north towards Budapest, just ask people if they are going to the north toll gate. (by [[User:NixyJungle|NixyJungle]])\\n\\nYou have three options for these destinations. \\n* First option is outdated and deleted. Look up for updated version.\\n* Second option is to get the tram #2, #3 or #13 to \\'\\'Savišće\\'\\' or \\'\\'Žitnjak\\'\\'. Get out at the last stop and then walk for about 15 minutes towards the motorway. On the motorway you\\'ll find a bus stop and there you can easily hitchhike towards the on-ramp in \\'\\'Ivanja Reka\\'\\' or you can even stop cars who are going to Belgrade or Bosnia. Ask the locals for extra tips and explanations.\\n: \\n- [[User:Chillion|Chillion]] (2018) This method is good. About 5-10mins before the bus stops (there are two on the same Street), is a church where you can fill up your water bottles at the tap inside the church yard. When I hitched from the bus stop I had both \"Slavonska Brod\"  and \"Ivanja Reka\" signs. After using both, the latter sign got me a ride in 5 mins, taking me to the town of Ivanja, where I was dropped off on the highway in the direction of Serbia. Got to Serbia that same day (1 car and 2 truck rides).\\n\\n\\'\\'[[User:nuclearphyllis|Nuclearphyllis]]\\' local experts took him to the first toll station on the Zagreb-Belgrade motorway, even though it was illegal to hitchhike from there. They weren\\'t troubled and got a ride within 10 minutes.\\'\\'\\n* Third option, go to Savski most and get on IKEA bus. It will take you to IKEA, and this is right on the highway to Belgrade, next to Dumovec. This bus ticket costs 10 kuna and you can use 5 kuna discount in IKEA for food or coffee. \\nBus leaves Savski most station at Mon-Sat: 9:00, 10:00, 12:00, 14:00, 16:00, 18:00\\nSun: 9:00, 10:00, 12:00, 14:00, 16:00\\nHere are the stops:\\nhttp://www.ikea.com/ms/hr_HR/about_store/ikea_bus.html?icid=hr%7Citl%7Chpl%7Ctxt_link_bus_line\\n\\n*I hitched 3 times in direction of Belgrade, so just one tip - if the car that is giving you a ride goes to Slavonski Brod (half way before Belgrade) ask him to drop you off at EAST EXIT of the city. in Croatian - ISTOČNI IZLAZ. because, if he drops you off at west exit, 95% of cars go to direction of Zagreb, I waited there 2 hours once, and the second time 3 hours ;)\\n\\nI could just add if you need to go from Zagreb to Osijek on high way A3 and a lot of cars are driving forward to Slavonski Brod Belgrade. You need to go out on turn to Đakovo and Osijek(high way A5). Than you walk right to high way and just climb up till turning for Osijek direction and hitchhike there at the beginning, cars need to slow down when they join to high way that leads to Osijek. If driver left you after Đakovo on some rest place near high way, try not to stuck up or avoid that.  Because on this high way in one hour maybe 15 cars passed by, so it is not so crowded with cars even that is main high way, try to catch ride directly to Osijek. People probably do not use often this high way becaue you must pay fee for driving there and normal road is free.\\n\\n=== Direction [[Budapest]], [[Varazdin]] and [[Cakovec]] ===\\n(Read below, this one doesn\\'t exist anymore! The best option is on the bottom - to HH on Slavonska avenija ) Take bus number 216 from Kvaternikov trg to the last stop in Ivanja Reka or bus 276 till 2 stations before the final station. Ask for the church in Ivanja Reka, people will know it, you should get out there. There will be a small road which leads to the on ramp, ask people for which one it is. You should walk till the traffic lights, the turn right and you already see the place. After the lights you should walk about 300 meters and you can start hitching there with a sign VZ for example. Works like a charm, someone waited there for less than 10 minutes.<br />\\n[[User:NixyJungle|NixyJungle]] edit: No need to walk 300 meters after traffic lights. You can ask people on the traffic light. It\\'s easier and more safe, plus, if the police comes, you are legal, because sign for the beginning of the highway and forbidden hitchhiking is 200 meters after the traffic light.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Update\\'\\'\\': This place doesn\\'t exist anymore, as the new road was built and there\\'s no stopping lane, so cars can\\'t stop to pick you up. Don\\'t hitchhike here.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Update - april 2012\\'\\'\\': There is able to hitchhike there, last year I was there, but it is \\'\\'\\'very hard to get out of there\\'\\'\\'. You need reach \\'\\'petrol station\\'\\' and the exit from station has got long shoulder where U can safely try to cach someone.\\n\\nThree problems:\\n#90% of cars which stop are those which leave the station.\\n#From those who stops almost everyone was local people.\\n#It was my one of the longest stops (no less than 3 houers).\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Update\\'\\'\\': The main problem with direction towards Hungary is that pay tolls are quite far away from Zagreb, so it would be easier if you first get to the pay tolls. The best starting point is the \"Tifon\" petrol station as it\\'s the furthest hitchhiking spot on the way to Varaždin and Budapest you can get to by public transportation (directions to there are already described in the directions to Belgrade section on the top of this topic - bus 216 or 176 from Kvaternikov trg...) and hold a sign \"ZELINA\" (the closest town to the pay tolls) or \"SV. HELENA\" (the exact name of that pay tolls). Many drivers get off the highway just before the pay tolls, so maybe you\\'ll have to walk a few kilometers. But once you\\'re there, you can easily get a ride straight to Budapest.\\n\\nSecond option is to hitchhike on Slavonska avenija, this way you dont have to take any public transportation. You can stand after the crossroad of Slavonska avenija and Ulica Josipa Marohnića. Many people go towards the highway on this road. We hitchhiked with the sign \"Sesvete\", got a ride in 15 mins and got dropped at the petrol station right in front of highway ramps in Ivanja Reka. From here we hitchhiked with sign \"Varazdin\" and got a ride in 15-20 mins and got dropped at the pay tolls towards north.\\n\\nNote: this (the crossing of Slavonska avenija and Ul. Ulica Josipa Marohnića) seems to be the best and easiest option. Many cars in the direction, there\\'re traffic lights + lot of space for cars to stop. From the central square (Trg bana Josipa Jelačića) you can either walk (southwards, 3km) or take trams 14 (direction ZAPRUĐE) or 17 (direction BORONGAJ)  for 15mins till the stop Vjesnik. The stop is near the crossing of Savska cesta and Slavonska avenija, so you have to walk 10min till the spot where Ul. Ulica Josipa Marohnića is. You can hold sign VŽ (Varaždin). Once you get a ride and are on the highway, be sure to get off at the first petrol station (OMV, some 20kms from the starting point), because it\\'s also the last one before Varaždin!\\n\\n[[User:Gallar|Gallar]] hitch-hiked (with girlfriend) from crossroad of Slavonska avenija and Ulica Josipa Marohnića and he waited 9 hours just for a single lift to mentioned OMV station. It might be bad luck, but be aware there is no better place to hike and yet this one might be not so perfect.\\n\\nNote: This can\\'t be a good hitchhiking spot by any reason as it\\'s too much inside the town and there\\'s too much of local traffic, also there are more cars coming to Zagreb from the west than those departing to the east. However, it\\'s not impossible, but getting a lift there in a normal time is more about the luck...\\n\\nUpdate: I think the best spot to hitchhike from is the gas station on Slavonska avenija 110, you can get there by taking 286 bus and walking for like 15 mins, even though it\\'s like 40 mins from the city centre but there is plenty of room to stop, also I dont recommend going to Varazdin and hoping to get a ride at the toll booth going to the highway because the traffic is pretty small there and mainly not towards budapest. There is a gas station before Varazdin(like 10 km) and we got a ride from there in like 5 mins.\\n\\nJune 2019\\n\\nAnother good option is to take the tram until Dubec.  At least 3 different lines end there.  Once you get there look for a bus going to Sesvete.  There will most likely be many people trying to board and you should be able to enter from any door.  The ride shouldn’t take more then 10 minutes and you will find it makes a left turn followed by two right turns soon after.  This is where you want to get off and cross the street. (Veraždinska cesta; bus stop Selčina) The bus stop on this side is slightly further up the road. You will then want bus 273 going to Lužan. (Someone entered this bus from the middle door as well.)  Take bus 273 to the end of the line.  From here it is just a 3.2 kilometer walk to the first gas station directly on the highway.  There is a gravel road after you cross over the highway which you can easily reach by going a couple hundred meters past the highway.  (No need to try and cross the ditch to reach it.) As you approach the gas station fence and the road turns to lead around the back you will see a gap where you can easily hop the fence and follow a well formed path directly to the parking lot.  It should be just a handful of meters after the curve and very easy to notice.\\n\\nThere are also plenty of good places where one can pitch a tent for the night if one wants to come out here in the evening and get a nice and early start the following morning.\\n\\n=== Direction [[Ljubljana]], [[Austria]], [[Novo Mesto]] ===\\n\\'\\'\\'From town\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nTake tram #5 or #17 from the centre of Zagreb towards the \\'\\'Precko\\'\\'. Notice that the ride takes a lot of time, 45 minutes at least. In \\'\\'Precko\\'\\', exit the tram and walk left. You\\'ll see a street that turns right. Take this street and walk 5 minutes till you get to the main street \\'\\'Ljubljanska Avenija\\'\\' (also called \\'\\'Zagrebacka Avenija\\'\\'). Cross this street in front of the \\'\\'Konzum\\'\\' supermarket and turn left. You will see a small bus station, this is your spot. However most people commute from this point. Best is to hitchhike from there with a SLO sign. Don\\'t take rides that don\\'t take you at least to the border - There is no good places to hitchhike further down the road. From the border crossing itself it\\'s relatively easy to get a good ride, even as far as to Austria.\\n\\nOn a [[Good times to hitchhike|Sunday]] Erga and [[User:Guaka|guaka]] waited way to long. Not a single car stopped in two hours time, and at the petrol stations everyone with space pretended not to go anywhere near Slovenia (West or North). Two Belgian guys didn\\'t manage to get a ride in the same period, also trying in different spots in the area ([[User:Guaka|guaka]] somehow convinced the West Gate bus driver to also pick them up). Use the West Gate option if you\\'re simply heading to Austria, find another solution if you\\'re heading towards Ljubljana...\\n\\nAfter more than one hour of waiting, I went further down the road to the next bus stop (in front of FORD car dealer center) where most of the local traffic is gone and I found a ride after 15min.\\n\\n* I recommend following this advice, after going to the Konzum market to get some food and cardboard I spent only 40 mn before someone offered to take me to Slovenia. You are highly visible and this worked at dawn.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'INA Lučko - north\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nINA Lučko - north is a big rest stop just outside Zagreb, and it takes quite a long time to come there from the city center. You have to take a tram to Savski most and then bus line 112 or 168 to Lučko centar. Don\\'t panic when you won\\'t see any shopping center as you expect, this place looks like a village;) from there, you walk for about 2km to reach the stop.\\n\\nIt is good place to hitchhike and locals told me that\\'s where everybody goes. For me it took whole 3.5h to get a pick (december 2019), but it was one day before christmas, so the place was deserted. I got a direct ride to Ljubljana after all, so i can recommend.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Take a bus to the highway\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nThis option takes you a bit longer to get started with (nearly an hour), it takes you directly to the highway though.\\n\\n== Much better option to Slovenia ==\\nTake a bus number 112 from \"Savski most\" bus station. Get of the bus at the last station. You should see highway from that place. If you don\\'t, ask for the direction. Above highway you will see an overpass. Go to the opposite side and hitchhike there at the entrance of the road. There is a petrol station with many cars entering the highway. If it\\'s easier for you, it is a place called Motel Plitvice and it\\'s here {{Coords|45.7747269|15.8804763}} (by [[User:NixyJungle|NixyJungle]])\\n\\nCaution: On a Sunday check the [http://www.zet.t-com.hr/media/144255/112nnn.pdf schedule for bus 112], since it does not depart very frequently that day - [[User:Questrayer|Questrayer]] had to wait for about 80 minutes. Apart from that, this option is very good, and he got a ride all the way to Ljubljana within 15 minutes approaching people at the petrol station.  \\n\\n=== North, direction [[Maribor]], [[Graz]], [[Vienna]] ===\\n==== First option ====\\nFrom the Črnomerec and Ljubljanica bus terminal there\\'s a free bus (red or white colour) to West Gate shopping centre which is adjacent to toll station (check out the West Gate Zagreb page to find out its schedule), see also [http://maps.google.com/?q=zagreb&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=City+of+Zagreb,+Croatia&ll=45.874518,15.829003&spn=0.009815,0.02459&t=h&z=16 Google Maps], the toll station is very close to the shopping center, you can see it from the parking lot where the bus arrives. But you will have to cross a bit of water. Don\\'t try this in the dark. Look for one of the areas with stones covered by metal or just walk about 300 metre in opposite direction of the shopping mall and you will find a little bridge, handy! then come back to the toll station.\\n\\nIf you\\'re heading to [[Slovenia]] or further you\\'ll have to make it to the [[Macelj-Kozminci border crossing]], from where you can easily get rides far into [[Germany]].\\n\\nYou better forget about trying the Precko option (towards Ljubljana), Erga and [[User:Guaka|guaka]] waited for about 2 hours, asking people, with signs (\\'\\'Macelj\\'\\', \\'\\'Maribor\\'\\', SLO) and without sign. Fortunately the free bus to the West Gate center also goes from this above spot.\\n\\n[[User:T0ma5|t0ma5]] was hitchhiking here in January 2011 and he got a ride all the way to Vienna in about 20min.\\n\\n[[User:Cro_gavran|Cro_gavran]] tried to hitchhike here in September 2014 but was in just few minutes forced to leave by highway guards. They said that same day they moved out from highway already 5 hitchhikers and called police to arrest two who didnt wanted to leave the highway. If someone else had same experience, please share.\\n\\n[[User:Uncle sam01|uncle_sam01]] hitched a direct ride to Bratislava in about 20 minutes in August 2015. Definitely wouldn\\'t recommend going over the bridge, since the right side is virtually impossible to walk towards the highway (bushes, trees, water, weeds, etc.). In August 2015 there was only a relatively short fence, which was easy to climb over but you must cross the highway, which is obviously not the safest thing to do, but cars go slow and there are no barriers in the middle. No one bothered us, except some maintenance guy in a pick up who was driving by, but we couldn\\'t make out what he was saying and no one from the toll booths told us anything even though they clearly saw us hitching.\\n\\n--[[User:Yeguaerrante|Yeguaerrante]] ([[User talk:Yeguaerrante|talk]]) 13:05, 18 November 2015 (CET) You can\\'t get to the toll station, it\\'s all fenced, i waited on the road after going for the blue small bridge, you will see a bridge that crosses the highway, a car pick me up after 20 min and took me to small town area, was really hard to get into the highway this way because there was a lot of locals not going too far away. \\n\\n--[[User:Duffajfka|Duffajfka]] walked from the shopping centre along D1 in the direction back to Zagreb until the highway ramp to the north. As it\\'s a two lane one with not too dense traffic, he tried to hitchhike from the guardrail with a sign \"Odmorište\" (service area), probably \"Naplatna Postaja\" (toll booth) would be easier. As he has already been inside the fence, he walked to the toll booth. It was quite a hard walk, but probably worth it. Tried to hitch right from the gates but was expelled by the staff few tens of meters behind the booth, where a car to Graz easily stopped in 20 mins. (May 2019)\\n \\nAs alternative, try to get Plitvice petrol station (not to confuse with famous National park!). It is reachable from Lučko trough the village. It is around 3 km walk.\\n\\n==== Second option ====\\n\\nInstead of the seemingly risky toll station, you can also get a bus to King Cross shopping center or simply walk along Ljubljanska avenija until you reach the on-ramp of the highway. The spot is an approach road of a nearby, not very frequented truck park and offers great visibility and space to pull over for bypassing drivers. [[User:Vapaakulkuri|vapaakulkuri]] however still had to wait about two hours to get a ride to the first gas station that is located about 20km down the road.\\n\\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\\n\\n[[trash:Zagreb]] [[nomad:Zagreb]]\\n\\n\\n[[Category:E65]]\\n[[Category:E59]]\\n[[Category:E71]]'},\n",

The development of the modern city is closely connected to the Bata Shoes company.\\nAnyway, the city is really calm and nice. The architecture is not so impressive but there are many good galleries especialy for young artist. Also you can see there nice museum of shoes, of course :D There is also the second biggest Zoo in Cz (if you support this cause) which is made in the forest.\\n\\nZlín is very good town for hitch-hike in every direction. its normal to wait between 10 - 20 minutes . Its better if you have [[signs]].\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== West towards [[Brno]] {{National Road Number Czech Republic|49}} ===\\nThe spot is near to Otrokovice but its no problem if you start hitch-hike from the bus stops in the city. It works perfect. [[User:Gavriella|Gavriella]] has never waited more than 20 minutes. Usually to Brno you can change 2 cars but if you want to go to another direction after Brno, tell the driver to leave you at the petrol station before Brno.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Slovakia]] and north towards [[Ostrava]] {{National Road Number Czech Republic|49}} ===\\n==== First option ====\\nYou can go on the main street \"Třída Tomáše Bati\" at the end of the street there is a Lidl supermarket and after another 5 min of walking you\\'re on a goodish spot; sometimes it\\'s a stand for speed measuring police car. At Vizovice (15 km) continue by the road {{National Road Number Czech Republic|49}} towards [[Slovakia]] or by the road {{National Road Number Czech Republic|69}} towards [[Vsetín]] and [[Ostrava]]. Most of people from Zlín goes the latter direction.\\n\\n==== Second option ====\\nTake a trolleybus 1, 11 or 12 to Příluky. Hitchhike before the traffic lights at the neighboring bus stop. Great spot - plenty of space to shoulder, no walking.\\n\\n{{Cities Czech Republic}}\\n{{Highways CZ}}\\n\\n__NOTOC__\\n[[Category:Czech Republic]]\\n[[Category:Zlínský kraj]]',\n",

Tell your driver to turn right at the traffic light an then immediately right again. At the upcoming traffic light you can get off. The driver should make 2 left turns to get back on the motorway again.\\n\\nYou\\'re now fairly central: Go trough the tunnel and follow the road: Bleiswijkseweg, Den Hoorn, Schinkelweg, Dorpsstraat and you\\'ll end up in the city centre (<1 km).\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n=== South/West towards [[Den Haag]], [[Delft]], [[Rotterdam]] ===\\nAt railway station Zoetermeer (not Zoetermeer Oost) (tram stop Driemanspolder) you will find a bridge for motorised vehicles, next to the pedestrian bridge \\'\\'Nelson Mandela\\'\\'. On the north side of this bridge is a bus stop (walk up the ramp). From here you can Hitch hike to Den Haag, Delft and Rotterdam as well as further south.\\n\\nAt the bus stop Fonteinbos on the road Afrikaweg (about 200 metres from the spot mentioned above) is an official hitch hiking spot. This hitch hiking spot is useful to acquire rides towards Den Haag, Delft and Rotterdam as well as further south. To reach this spot from Centrum West bus station, walk over the pedestrian bridge, walk down and turn right at the traffic lights, trough the pedestrian / cyclist tunnel.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Leiden]], [[Amsterdam]] ===\\nIn the Centre, next to the AIVD building on Europaweg you will find road N206 (Zwaardsloodseweg). Here is a bus stop and a small parking space, these are ideal for hitch hiking.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Gouda]], [[Utrecht]] ===\\nAt the bus stop Pruimengaarde on the road Australieweg is an official hitch hiking spot. This hitch hiking spot is useful to acquire rides towards [[Gouda]] and [[Utrecht]]. In [[Gouda]] it is very easy to obtain a ride to [[Utrecht]].\\nTo reach this spot from tram stop Palenstein, walk under the viaduct, turn right on the small bicycle road Kangaroepad, after a while turn right trough the tunnel and then up to the bus stop.\\n\\n== Public Transport ==\\nZoetermeer has two tram lines and various bus lines to most areas of the city. The tram goes to Den Haag. Be aware that though most of the two tram routes are the same, both lines start and finish differently. paying works like everywhere in the Netherlands. The city has two zones Oosterheem and everything else. In the trams are ticket vending machines witch accept coins only. The driver doesn\\'t sell tickets, sometimes controllers do. You don\\'t have to pay when the machine is broken. After 9:00 a cheap trip to Den Haag and back can be made using a \"Dalurenretour Den Haag Plus\" (off-peak return for The Hague metropolitan area), EUR 4.\\n\\nZoetermeer has two railway stations on the Den Haag - Gouda line, only so called \\'\\'sprinter\\'\\' trains stop at Zoetermeer and Zoetermeer Oost railway stations.\\n\\nOn the night between Saturday and Sunday Zoetermeer is connected to the night railway network by bus B17 to Rotterdam central station and bus N5 to Den Haag centre (Buitenhof) and the central station (the Nighttrain stops at Den Haag Hollands spoor, take bus N1 to Buitenhof and transfer, same ticket). Night bus tickets cost about EUR 4.00 and can be bought at the driver.\\n\\n== Places to Visit ==\\nZoetermeer is not too exciting, but a nice centrally located city from where you can pay visits to the historical cities around it. Zoetermeer has an old centre consisting of only one street and some parks for you to have a relaxing walk. Zoetermeers architecture is very interesting as the city is build almost entirely in compliance with the VINEX Spatial Planning bill (even the street names are in alphabetical order).\\n\\n== Places to Avoid ==\\nZoetermeer is pretty safe, crime rates are lower then in average big cities in the Netherlands.\\nThe mayor of Zoetermeer has declared alcohol prohibition zones in the city centre and in some parks and squares.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n{{Cities Netherlands}}\\n{{Cities Zuid-Holland}}\\n\\n[[Category:E30]]\\n[[Category:City\\'s]]\\n[[ru:Зутермер]]\\n[[nl:Zoetermeer]]',\n",

There\\'s a bus stop right after the crossing. Once you hit the roundabout at the small village of Gietelo, make sure to continue on the {{Nnl|345}} towards Apeldoorn. That means you\\'ll have to turn left instead of going straight.\\n\\nIf your driver goes to the on-ramp at the {{Anl|1}} (on-ramp 21), it might be wise to leave the car at one of the two roundabouts after Gietelo.

From here you can hitchhike through the countryside in eastern direction on a straightforward route to Deventer.\\n\\n====Option 2====\\n{{Coords|52.4860|6.1272}} Roundabour<br>\\n{{Coords|52.4699|6.1322}} Crossing<br>\\nIf you are more in the south-east of the city, get to the roundabout on the {{Nnl|337}} just after the crossing of the ''IJsselallee'' and ''Oldeneelallee''. An alternative if you don't mind walking is getting to the crossing of the {{Nnl|337}} and the ''Hollewandsweg'' at very south-eastern part of the city.\\n\\n=== South-east towards [[Almelo]], [[Enschede]] and [[Germany]] ===\\n{{Coords|52.5049|6.1261}}<br>\\nIf you're heading to Twente or Germany, head down to one of the many bus stops on the ''Ceintuurbaan''. Bus stop ''Kuyerhuislaan'' seems to be the most suitable one because of its location (best compromise between distance from city centre and amount of local traffic), but feel free to try ''Meppelerstraatweg'' or the abandoned one next to the Isala hospital if you don't feel like walking that far or ''De Marslanden'' if you want to filter out local traffic. A shared trait of all of the above spots is that the cars might be going too fast to stop for you, but, with a little bit of luck, you should be able to get a ride to the south-east within no time.\\n\\n== Sleeping ==\\nSouth of the city centre is a park called ''Het Engelse Werk'' / ''Spoolderbos''. There are some quiet places here where you can pitch a tent. To get there follow the ''Nieuwe Veerallee'' and cross under the {{Nnl|337}} through the pedestrian/cyclist tunnel.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n----\\n<!--Infoboxes and categories.

It is the biggest city in Switzerland, but not its capital. The city is well connected with motorways in all directions. Keep in mind that Zürich (and Switzerland in general) is expensive compared to its neighbouring countries.     \\n\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n\\n=== Northwest towards [[Basel]] {{European Route Number|60}}, southwest towards [[Bern]] {{European Route Number|35}}, ===\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1 \\'\\'\\'\\n\\nTake tram 4 to \\'\\'Sportweg\\'\\'. Cross the tram tracks to the opposite platform and walk back about 30m in the direction the tram came to the lay-by on Pfingstweidstrasse.

It is also a spot easily accessible from the city center.  \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2 \\'\\'\\'\\n\\nAnother option is to reach a petrol station on the motorway by train and then foot. Take the S12 to \\'\\'Kilwangen-Spreitenbach\\'\\'. The stop is near the service station. One can also use this petrol station to go east and south of \\'\\'\\'Zürich\\'\\'\\' by using the opposite side to the Bern/Basel exit.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nThird option is to reach an other petrol station on the motorway by train and then foot.Take the S6 (Direction Baden) and stop at Würenlos or go to the train station Killwangen Spreitenbach (there are both at the same distance more or less). From there you will have to walk to the gas station (C8QX+F3 Würenlos, Suisse)  crossing the village and then follow a road leading the station itself (crossing nice fields and a little forest from Würenlos). There is a gate which opens in both direction that gives you access to this big gas station and you can access both sides of the motorway since the stations are connected. Easy rides towards to Lausanne/Geneve and even France.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Italy]] {{European Route Number|41}}, east towards [[Austria]] ===\\n\\nFollow signs in the city for motorway 4 to [[Luzern]]. You will reach West st. Just past the intersection of West and Werd, there is a driveway in front of an apartment building where cars can pull over just before the right turn onto the onramp of motorway 4. To get to the onramp of the motorway from Bahnhof Wiedikon (a railway station nearby) take a look at [https://www.google.ch/maps/dir/Z%C3%BCrich+Wiedikon,+Z%C3%BCrich/Manessestrasse+20,+8003+Z%C3%BCrich/@47.3702897,8.522488,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x47900a1e9e5a5b63:0x35a0725eba643021!2m2!1d8.5235907!2d47.3714192!1m5!1m1!1s0x47900a1dbcf1e373:0xc912a02604833ebf!2m2!1d8.5250992!2d47.3692875!3e2 this map]. It is also possible to walk from the city center, it should take you about 15-20 min.\\n\\n\\nThis spot is also an option if you are heading for the canton of Graubünden, Austria, Liechtenstein, and southern Germany, especially Munich (via Bregenz).\\n\\nSince there is the bypass tunnel, you can also stay at the spot at Pfingstweidstrasse (look above) to go towards Luzern and Italy. There are not so many cars going in this direction, but it is a very kindly spot.\\n\\n\\nUpdate nov 2024: \\nThis spot is outside a fire station and is illegal to stop there, I would not say this is a good spot. If you want to hitch this road there is another spot just down the road right before the road splits and where the big signs are.\\n\\nIn my experience this spot is not very good, a lot off traffic but nobody stopped for me, and many are probably not going far. I think a way better way of getting out of Zürich is to take the bus to Affoltern where you can go to the gas station and raststätte right by the highway.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Germany]], east towards [[Austria]], [[Germany]] ===\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\' from city centre\\n\\nTo start towards Germany from the City Centre you can also take the public transport to Limmatplatz and walk over the Kornhausbrücke. On the other side of the bridge you take the stairs down to the Wasserwerkstrasse. Just some hundred meters from there the highway starts into a tunnel to the left. You can walk near the tunnel and take position in the middle of the street on the traffic island just in front of the traffic light. Like that the cars can see you easily and you can jump in, while it is red. Unfortunately, this position is not very comfortable because you are standing in the middle of the traffic (an I am not sure, if it is legal... but normally you come away quite fast). If you don`t like that (or if it is raining) you can also stay under the Kornhausbrücke. There is not so much traffic, but it is also ok. The best thing is to write Winterthur on your board. Like that you are coming to the petrol station Kempttal just in front of Winterthur.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\' BP petrol station\\n\\nTake S-Bahn S7 to Kemptthal (~25 minutes from the main station), then walk up the hill in the direction from where the train came from. After a 5 min walk, you should see a grassy hill on your right hand side. Walk to the top of the grassy hill and you will find a BP petrol station, a restaurant and a small COOP supermarket.\\n\\n\\n== Public Transport (Freeriding) ==\\n\\nOn the buses after 21.00 (when the controllers stop their work day) one has to enter at the front and show the driver their ticket, before then, one should be really careful because the conductors can come with a whole bunch of people and won\\'t let anyone out. Better to take the tram - according to a friend who grew up in Zurich the chance is very small that there will be a control, and after 21 there won\\'t be any controllers at all. \\n\\nHowever, if taking the tram during the day, and there is a control, you are going to be caught. They come in a giant group of ~15 and take up the entire station so you can\\'t escape. I was caught 8/2015 and plead poverty, although while I had my wallet out giving ID, he discovered I had euros (40), so he took that, saying I owed the remaining 60 and gave me a receipt/bill/ticket.\\n\\nYou can also reach everything in Zürich very easy by bike.

There are many small islands which can be reached by hitchhiking a boat. \\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\nIf you are coming to Šibenik from one of the islands and want to hitchhike further, it makes sense to already begin asking people for a ride while you are still on the boat.\\n\\n=== Asking people coming back on land from the boats. ===\\n\\nOne option is to go to the harbor and wait for the many boats that constantly arrive from the islands. Many people are coming back from their holidays, get their car they parked somewhere in the city and head home, which might just be where you want to go. One option is to make a sign and wait at the place where people are coming back on land and ask for a ride.\\n\\n=== East & North [[Zagreb]], [[Rijeka]], [[Zadar]] ===\\n\\nWalk up the street Ulica kralja Zvonimira which later becomes Ulica 113. šibenske brigade HV-a till the petrol station. There you will have 2 different options. If you want to make some distance, ideally you find people who go on the A1, if they don't go so far they can drop you off on one of the gas stations on the A1. If you get on the coastal street D8 you will likely travel way slower by hitching from village to village with quite long waiting times.\\n\\n'''Option 1: Petrol Station'''\\n\\nYou can ask people directly at the petrol station if they can give you a ride. Unfortunately most people who tank there stay in the region.\\n\\n'''Option 2'''\\n[[File:On-road to zadar without space.jpeg|120px|thumb|left|On-ramp with no space for cars to pull over]]\\n[[File:On-road to zadar with space.jpeg|120px|thumb|right|On-ramp with space for cars to pull over]]\\nWalk north to the second roundabout. There are two different on-roads to go towards Zadar where it is possible to hitchhike. The first, the one more to the right, only has few cars but is ideal for cars to pull over. The second one is the other way around, many cars who pass by, but it is difficult for them to pull over as there is no space. Standing between the two on-roads, lifting up both of your thumbs, to hitchhike on both roads at the same time, doesn't work.\",\n",

You can hitchhike there, direction north, after the light. There isn\\'t any bus stop, but a lot of cars stop. With a sign with \"Jerusalem\" or \"Tel Aviv\" maybe it works better, but anyway its super easy.\\n\\n=== East to [[Arad (Israel)|Arad]], [[Dead Sea (Israel)|Dead Sea]] ===\\n\\nFrom Negev Brigade interchange, hitchhike east to the next major junction (\"Shoket\"), where road 60 meets road 31 west towards Tel Aviv or road 31 east towards Arad and the hotels area of the Dead Sea. Cars going directly onto highway 6 north won\\'t help you to get to \"Shoket\" junction, there\\'s no place to let you off and to walk to \"Shoket\" junction, unless they are willing to do an extra mile to \"Shoket\" junction, then they can take a left onto highway 31 west on back onto highway 6.\\n\\nOn \"Shoket\" junction hitch directly to the Dead Sea or to Arad (no point in taking a hitchhike to a beduoin camp along the way (there are plenty) - since most drivers won\\'t stop near bedouin camps for onward journeys) ([https://goo.gl/maps/KM3jBjRr6pw Google map for Shoket junction road 31 south hitch point]).\\n\\n=== South to [[Dimona]], [[Eilat]], Aqaba ([[Jordan]]), Taba ([[Egypt]]) ===\\nYou can try to hitchhike southwards from the junction of Derekh Eilat (Eilat road inside Be\\'er Sheva) and Tozeret Ha\\'Aretz, this is the southern part of civilization before it\\'s all desert. This should get you to Eilat via [[Mitzpe Ramon]] on highway 40.\\n\\nTo hitchhike to Eilat via Dimona (eastwards to highway 25 and then southwards to highway 90) - you can try hitchhiking from Yigal Alon blvd, just east of their junction with Derekh Eilat (Eilat road) ([https://goo.gl/maps/nevpGCi5sWG2 Google street view]). Another option is to get further under Sarah interchange (\\'\\'Google street view\\'\\' {{Coords|31.2249031|34.8298294|1}}).\\nThe road passes through Dimona, meets up with road 90, gets southbound traffic from the Dead Sea (and from Jerusalem) at [[Ha\\'Arava Junction]], and ends in [[Eilat]].\\nNext to [[Eilat]] (a great destination by itself) are Jordanian and Egyptian border crossings.\\n{{IsIn|Israel}}\\n\\n{{Cities Israel}}\\n[[Category:Israel]]'},\n",

The European route [[E30]] passes through it entering at [[Brest (Belarus)|Brest]] on the border with [[Poland]] and leaving at the [[Russia]]n border between [[Orša]] and [[Smolensk]]. It is a fantastic and easy-going place for hitchhiking and the police or the political system generally will not bother you at all, so once you have your visa (if needed) you can just relax and go for it. You will enjoy!\\n\\n== General information ==\\n72% of the population live in towns and cities, and virtually all the population speaks Russian as their first language. In rural areas a mix of Russian and Belarusian may be spoken. It is therefore better to make destination [[signs]] in Russian when hitchhiking.\\n\\nAlso, there are two versions of the Belarusian flag – the official one is the red-green flag (also jokingly known as “dusk over a swamp”), whereas the one used by the opposition is a three-striped white-red-white flag. For your own safety, it is not advised to demonstrate the latter one in public.\\n\\nFreedom of speech is very restricted in Belarus, try not to ask too many questions about mr. Lukashenko, people might get in trouble when saying something bad about their politics.\\n\\n== Language ==\\nIn big cities, especially Minsk, you can expect young people to speak at least a basic level of English. If you are hitch-hiking to Russia along [[E30]]/[[M1 (Belarus)|M1]], expect some truck drivers to speak Polish as well as Russian.\\n\\nLanguage barrier can cause some troubles since many drivers speak almost exclusively only Russian or \\'\\'Trasianka\\'\\', the mishmash of Belarusian and Russian, therefore learn some basic phrases in Russian before you go there. If you do understand some Russian but you are not familiar with Belarusian culture don\\'t get scared or disappointed hearing many swearing words when drivers talk to you – these words aren\\'t directed to you but are rather a simple hearty expression.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking ==\\n\\nHitchhiking in Belarus is very easy and rarely your waiting time will exceed 15 minutes, at least on the main road M1 from [[Brest]] via [[Minsk]] to [[Moscow]]. As it is very common in Belarus, often drivers may pick you up without being curious about you or what you are doing, sometimes no communication at all. Belarusian people can seem gloomy at first sight, but in the end they are mostly very nice and helpful and drop you on a good spot. In rare cases a small number of older drivers might ask for some money when giving you a ride – to avoid that, tell the driver about your intention to travel for free before you sit into the car (\\'\\'\"Ja puteshestvuju avtostopom, bez deneg\"\\'\\' [\\'\\'\"u\"\\'\\' is pronounced as \\'\\'\"oo\"\\'\\' in English] – \\'\\'\"I travel by hitch-hiking, not paying any money\"\\'\\'). Usually, just saying \\'no money\\' works just fine too. It might be more difficult if you are more than 2 persons travelling together – in such case it would be smart to split up for some time. \\n\\nWhen hitchhiking in Belarus, it is very likely to find some other people standing next to the road, waiting for a car to pick them up. Although most people do not speak English well, it is nice to try to make some contact. Most of them might look angry, but it\\'s just on the outside and once you start talking to them they\\'re just very friendly and warm people. Some Belarusians will even wait for an hour with you in a snowstorm, waiting for another car to stop :) \\n\\nRussian and Baltic truck drivers are reluctant to stop for hitchhikers in Belarus while Belarusian and Polish trucks are happy to have a company of some traveller(s). Hitchhiking at night is difficult but if you make yourself very visible you can get a ride even at two o\\'clock at night (some cars might stop just because a driver thinks you are police – light reflectors might give such an impression).\\n\\nThe average waiting time is about 20 minutes. It’s better to travel using main roads as road traffic on local roads is pretty poor. In Belarus there are no roads with limitations for hitchhikers, you can start stopping a car wherever you like, the only exception is bridges. Roadsides are usually wide enough to stop even a truck. Main roads are in a good condition while roads in rural areas might unpleasantly surprise you. \\n\\n[[File:IMG 20170717 154059.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Light-returning reflectinve band. This little thing can save you about 10€ when you meet the policy at the road]]\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Note\\'\\'\\': In Belarus you have to wear a flicker (light-returning element or reflective band) when you are on the road after sunset. The [[police]] have a plan to get some amount of violators each month, so the possibility of penalty (about € 10) is quite high. It\\'s better to buy a flicker (it costs from € 1), and it\\'s not a problem – now they are sold in any shop in Belarus. And it\\'s [[hitchhiker\\'s safety|a good idea]] to use them anyway when [[hitchhiking at night]].\\n\\n\\n== Maps ==\\n[[File:Ratmir_autostop_Minsk.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Ratmir]] hitching from [[Minsk]] to [[Polack]]]]\\nThere are only about fifteen main roads in Belarus, so if you are not staying in Belarus for long you can hitch through having just a print from any Internet source (for example, this [http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/google_map_belarus.htm]). More detailed maps can be bought in any kiosk of \"Bielsajuzdruk\" (\"Белсаюздрук\"), where newspapers are sold.\\n\\n== Eating ==\\nIn Belarus the road service is very poor, and restaurants in normal amount (for every 30-40 km) exists only on main roads, like [[E30]]/[[M1 (Belarus)|M1]]. But on the way there are usually a lot of small towns and villages, where in the shops you can find anything what you need (and 2-3 times cheaper than in a cafe). And of course, if you want to find some ready dishes, you can go to a students canteen or something like that.\\n\\n== Visa ==\\nForeign citizens of 74 countries, who \\'\\'\\'both enter\\'\\'\\' and \\'\\'\\'leave\\'\\'\\' via Minsk International Airport, can enter Belarus for up to 30 days \\'\\'\\'without visa\\'\\'\\' (since July 27, 2018). This does not extend to persons coming to Belarus by plane from Russia, as well as to those who would fly out via Russia (such flights are considered as internal ones and do not have border control).\\n\\nNevertheless you have to fulfil several requirements to be able to enter the country without visa. For more information check web-pages of the Belorussian MFA and State Border Committee of the Republic of Belarus:\\n\\n[http://mfa.gov.by/en/visa/visafreetravel/e0ced19bb1f9bf2c.html \\'\\'Information on visa-free travel via the checkpoint \"Minsk National Airport\"\\'\\']<br>\\n[https://gpk.gov.by/en/border-crossing/ \\'\\'Border crossing rules for foreign citizens\\'\\']\\n\\n[[File:Belarus_regional_visa-free_provisions_in_Grodno_and_Brest_regions.png|220px|thumb|right|Part of Belarus covered by Brest and Hrodna regional visa-free provision]]\\nAdditionally, you can also enter some parts of the country overland without a visa for up to 15 days. In order to visit Brest and Hrodna regions for 15 days without visas you need to get visa-free travel documents at least 72 hours before your journey to Belarus.\\n\\nFor more details check the following link: [https://bezviz.by/en/ \\'\\'Belarus visa free\\'\\'].\\n\\nFor an old-fashioned visa, follow this procedure:\\nTry to find someone on Couchsurfing/BeWelcome/TrustRoots who\\'d be willing to \"invite\" you to Belarus (thus you could apply for a \"private visit\" visa), as this would save you money in the visa application process - the only way to get a regular tourist visa is through an overpriced agency, which would be eager to book hotels on your behalf. Some embassies may be satisfied with a confirmed hotel booking, without an agency letter, but that would be up to their discretion. However, most Belarusian embassies will issue a \"private visit\" visa without a letter of invitation or other supporting documents where only the personal info of the inviting person would suffice if the visa duration is less than 30 days. In some cases, they may however ask for a copy of the inviting person\\'s passport but again that would be up to the discretion of the embassy personnel.\\n\\n\\'\\'[[user:uncle_sam01|uncle_sam01]] applied for a private visit visa at the embassy in Warsaw in July 2016 and was asked to provide a copy of the inviting person\\'s passport. Other than that the process was a mere formality.\\'\\'\\n\\n== Registration ==\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'UPDATE (2019): As from 2nd January 2019, foreigners can register online and for free. See [http://belarusfeed.com/belarus-allows-online-registration-tourists/] for more details on how to register online. Important caveat: online registration is NOT possible if you entered Belarus from Russia. In this case, you must register at a Department for Citizenship and Migration.\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nThe old-fashioned way:\\n\\nWhen travelling to Belarus, you have to be registered with the authorities as a \"temporary resident\" if you stay in the country for longer than 5 business days (\\'\\'\\'including Saturday!\\'\\'\\'). Registration consists of a Soviet-style blue stamp on the back of your \"Migration Card\" (you\\'ll get this at the border).How this is done will vary depending on where you stay:\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'1. Hotels only\\'\\'\\'\\nEasiest option - they\\'ll do it for you automatically and you won\\'t have to worry about it. In some rare instances, they may charge extra for registration.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'2. Couchsurfing/squatting/camping\\'\\'\\'\\nYou\\'ll have to visit the local \"Migration Department\" within 5 business days(\\'\\'\\'including Saturday!\\'\\'\\') \\'\\'\\'with your as well as your host\\'s passport\\'\\'\\'(they don\\'t have to be there in person, but if you don\\'t speak Russian, it\\'s best that they are). You\\'ll fill out a form and pay a fee(around EUR 10). It might sound scary, but it\\'s relatively straightforward. You should register with your first host upon arrival to Belarus for the entire duration of your stay(until your visa expires) - you won\\'t have to worry about/pay for registration again. Legally, you should re-register if you stay somewhere else for more than 5 days, but no one will bother you about this...\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'3. Couchsurfing+hotels\\'\\'\\'\\nThis is the most complicated option. Hotels will only register you for the duration of your booking. Once you check out, you\\'re no longer considered registered. Therefore, if you then stay with someone through couchsurfing, you\\'d need to register immediately, in person, as in option 2. If you register with a host first (regardless for how long) and \\'\\'\\'then\\'\\'\\' stay at a hotel, your previous registration becomes void and the hotel registration applies, so the moment you check out you need to re-register somewhere else (either stay in another hotel or register with a host - again the 5 day period won\\'t apply). You could ask the hotel to not stamp your card, so that your previous registration is still valid during and after your hotel stay but this is technically illegal and up to the receptionist\\'s discretion. ([[user:uncle_sam01|uncle_sam01]] got his hotel stamp on a sticky note with a \"you-naughty-boy\" gesture from the receptionist...) \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Lack of and/or incorrect registration will lead to fines for you and your host, sometimes even deportation!!! (if your host had a previous guest who also screwed up their registration, they\\'d be considered a repeat offender and would face a higher fine)\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nBasically, plan your first night in Belarus with a CS host and register with them until your visa expires. If you stay at a hotel afterwards, make sure they don\\'t stamp your migration card any more. Registration sounds way scarier than it is and shouldn\\'t deter you from visiting Belarus.\\n\\n== Border crossing ==\\n\\nBelarus is neither in the [[European Union]] nor in the [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen]] Common Travel Area, and most non-[[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] nationals would require a visa to enter the country. However, since July 2018 there is a possibility to enter the country without visa for citizens of about 80 foreign countries. See \"Visa\" section. \\n\\nYou can check [http://gpk.gov.by/en/maps/ochered.php border crossing queues] and find more [http://gpk.gov.by/en/maps/ detailed info about border crossings] at the web-site of State Border Committee of the Republic of Belarus.\\n\\n=== With [[Latvia]] (from east to west)===\\n* [https://www.google.com/maps/place/55%C2%B043\\'06.5%22N+26%C2%B052\\'27.4%22E/@55.718463,26.8721013,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d55.7184603!4d26.8742901?hl=en Urbany (BLR) / Silene (LV)] (bel.

The European route [[E30]] passes through it entering at [[Brest (Belarus)|Brest]] on the border with [[Poland]] and leaving at the [[Russia]]n border between [[Orša]] and [[Smolensk]]. It is a fantastic and easy-going place for hitchhiking and the police or the political system generally will not bother you at all, so once you have your visa (if needed) you can just relax and go for it. You will enjoy!\\n\\n== General information ==\\n72% of the population live in towns and cities, and virtually all the population speaks Russian as their first language. In rural areas a mix of Russian and Belarusian may be spoken. It is therefore better to make destination [[signs]] in Russian when hitchhiking.\\n\\nAlso, there are two versions of the Belarusian flag – the official one is the red-green flag (also jokingly known as “dusk over a swamp”), whereas the one used by the opposition is a three-striped white-red-white flag. For your own safety, it is not advised to demonstrate the latter one in public.\\n\\nFreedom of speech is very restricted in Belarus, try not to ask too many questions about mr. Lukashenko, people might get in trouble when saying something bad about their politics.\\n\\n== Language ==\\nIn big cities, especially Minsk, you can expect young people to speak at least a basic level of English. If you are hitch-hiking to Russia along [[E30]]/[[M1 (Belarus)|M1]], expect some truck drivers to speak Polish as well as Russian.\\n\\nLanguage barrier can cause some troubles since many drivers speak almost exclusively only Russian or \\'\\'Trasianka\\'\\', the mishmash of Belarusian and Russian, therefore learn some basic phrases in Russian before you go there. If you do understand some Russian but you are not familiar with Belarusian culture don\\'t get scared or disappointed hearing many swearing words when drivers talk to you – these words aren\\'t directed to you but are rather a simple hearty expression.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking ==\\n\\nHitchhiking in Belarus is very easy and rarely your waiting time will exceed 15 minutes, at least on the main road M1 from [[Brest]] via [[Minsk]] to [[Moscow]]. As it is very common in Belarus, often drivers may pick you up without being curious about you or what you are doing, sometimes no communication at all. Belarusian people can seem gloomy at first sight, but in the end they are mostly very nice and helpful and drop you on a good spot. In rare cases a small number of older drivers might ask for some money when giving you a ride – to avoid that, tell the driver about your intention to travel for free before you sit into the car (\\'\\'\"Ja puteshestvuju avtostopom, bez deneg\"\\'\\' [\\'\\'\"u\"\\'\\' is pronounced as \\'\\'\"oo\"\\'\\' in English] – \\'\\'\"I travel by hitch-hiking, not paying any money\"\\'\\'). Usually, just saying \\'no money\\' works just fine too. It might be more difficult if you are more than 2 persons travelling together – in such case it would be smart to split up for some time. \\n\\nWhen hitchhiking in Belarus, it is very likely to find some other people standing next to the road, waiting for a car to pick them up. Although most people do not speak English well, it is nice to try to make some contact. Most of them might look angry, but it\\'s just on the outside and once you start talking to them they\\'re just very friendly and warm people. Some Belarusians will even wait for an hour with you in a snowstorm, waiting for another car to stop :) \\n\\nRussian and Baltic truck drivers are reluctant to stop for hitchhikers in Belarus while Belarusian and Polish trucks are happy to have a company of some traveller(s). Hitchhiking at night is difficult but if you make yourself very visible you can get a ride even at two o\\'clock at night (some cars might stop just because a driver thinks you are police – light reflectors might give such an impression).\\n\\nThe average waiting time is about 20 minutes. It’s better to travel using main roads as road traffic on local roads is pretty poor. In Belarus there are no roads with limitations for hitchhikers, you can start stopping a car wherever you like, the only exception is bridges. Roadsides are usually wide enough to stop even a truck. Main roads are in a good condition while roads in rural areas might unpleasantly surprise you. \\n\\n[[File:IMG 20170717 154059.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Light-returning reflectinve band. This little thing can save you about 10€ when you meet the policy at the road]]\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Note\\'\\'\\': In Belarus you have to wear a flicker (light-returning element or reflective band) when you are on the road after sunset. The [[police]] have a plan to get some amount of violators each month, so the possibility of penalty (about € 10) is quite high. It\\'s better to buy a flicker (it costs from € 1), and it\\'s not a problem – now they are sold in any shop in Belarus. And it\\'s [[hitchhiker\\'s safety|a good idea]] to use them anyway when [[hitchhiking at night]].\\n\\n\\n== Maps ==\\n[[File:Ratmir_autostop_Minsk.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Ratmir]] hitching from [[Minsk]] to [[Polack]]]]\\nThere are only about fifteen main roads in Belarus, so if you are not staying in Belarus for long you can hitch through having just a print from any Internet source (for example, this [http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/google_map_belarus.htm]). More detailed maps can be bought in any kiosk of \"Bielsajuzdruk\" (\"Белсаюздрук\"), where newspapers are sold.\\n\\n== Eating ==\\nIn Belarus the road service is very poor, and restaurants in normal amount (for every 30-40 km) exists only on main roads, like [[E30]]/[[M1 (Belarus)|M1]]. But on the way there are usually a lot of small towns and villages, where in the shops you can find anything what you need (and 2-3 times cheaper than in a cafe). And of course, if you want to find some ready dishes, you can go to a students canteen or something like that.\\n\\n== Visa ==\\nForeign citizens of 74 countries, who \\'\\'\\'both enter\\'\\'\\' and \\'\\'\\'leave\\'\\'\\' via Minsk International Airport, can enter Belarus for up to 30 days \\'\\'\\'without visa\\'\\'\\' (since July 27, 2018). This does not extend to persons coming to Belarus by plane from Russia, as well as to those who would fly out via Russia (such flights are considered as internal ones and do not have border control).\\n\\nNevertheless you have to fulfil several requirements to be able to enter the country without visa. For more information check web-pages of the Belorussian MFA and State Border Committee of the Republic of Belarus:\\n\\n[http://mfa.gov.by/en/visa/visafreetravel/e0ced19bb1f9bf2c.html \\'\\'Information on visa-free travel via the checkpoint \"Minsk National Airport\"\\'\\']<br>\\n[https://gpk.gov.by/en/border-crossing/ \\'\\'Border crossing rules for foreign citizens\\'\\']\\n\\n[[File:Belarus_regional_visa-free_provisions_in_Grodno_and_Brest_regions.png|220px|thumb|right|Part of Belarus covered by Brest and Hrodna regional visa-free provision]]\\nAdditionally, you can also enter some parts of the country overland without a visa for up to 15 days. In order to visit Brest and Hrodna regions for 15 days without visas you need to get visa-free travel documents at least 72 hours before your journey to Belarus.\\n\\nFor more details check the following link: [https://bezviz.by/en/ \\'\\'Belarus visa free\\'\\'].\\n\\nFor an old-fashioned visa, follow this procedure:\\nTry to find someone on Couchsurfing/BeWelcome/TrustRoots who\\'d be willing to \"invite\" you to Belarus (thus you could apply for a \"private visit\" visa), as this would save you money in the visa application process - the only way to get a regular tourist visa is through an overpriced agency, which would be eager to book hotels on your behalf. Some embassies may be satisfied with a confirmed hotel booking, without an agency letter, but that would be up to their discretion. However, most Belarusian embassies will issue a \"private visit\" visa without a letter of invitation or other supporting documents where only the personal info of the inviting person would suffice if the visa duration is less than 30 days. In some cases, they may however ask for a copy of the inviting person\\'s passport but again that would be up to the discretion of the embassy personnel.\\n\\n\\'\\'[[user:uncle_sam01|uncle_sam01]] applied for a private visit visa at the embassy in Warsaw in July 2016 and was asked to provide a copy of the inviting person\\'s passport. Other than that the process was a mere formality.\\'\\'\\n\\n== Registration ==\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'UPDATE (2019): As from 2nd January 2019, foreigners can register online and for free. See [http://belarusfeed.com/belarus-allows-online-registration-tourists/] for more details on how to register online. Important caveat: online registration is NOT possible if you entered Belarus from Russia. In this case, you must register at a Department for Citizenship and Migration.\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nThe old-fashioned way:\\n\\nWhen travelling to Belarus, you have to be registered with the authorities as a \"temporary resident\" if you stay in the country for longer than 5 business days (\\'\\'\\'including Saturday!\\'\\'\\'). Registration consists of a Soviet-style blue stamp on the back of your \"Migration Card\" (you\\'ll get this at the border).How this is done will vary depending on where you stay:\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'1. Hotels only\\'\\'\\'\\nEasiest option - they\\'ll do it for you automatically and you won\\'t have to worry about it. In some rare instances, they may charge extra for registration.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'2. Couchsurfing/squatting/camping\\'\\'\\'\\nYou\\'ll have to visit the local \"Migration Department\" within 5 business days(\\'\\'\\'including Saturday!\\'\\'\\') \\'\\'\\'with your as well as your host\\'s passport\\'\\'\\'(they don\\'t have to be there in person, but if you don\\'t speak Russian, it\\'s best that they are). You\\'ll fill out a form and pay a fee(around EUR 10). It might sound scary, but it\\'s relatively straightforward. You should register with your first host upon arrival to Belarus for the entire duration of your stay(until your visa expires) - you won\\'t have to worry about/pay for registration again. Legally, you should re-register if you stay somewhere else for more than 5 days, but no one will bother you about this...\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'3. Couchsurfing+hotels\\'\\'\\'\\nThis is the most complicated option. Hotels will only register you for the duration of your booking. Once you check out, you\\'re no longer considered registered. Therefore, if you then stay with someone through couchsurfing, you\\'d need to register immediately, in person, as in option 2. If you register with a host first (regardless for how long) and \\'\\'\\'then\\'\\'\\' stay at a hotel, your previous registration becomes void and the hotel registration applies, so the moment you check out you need to re-register somewhere else (either stay in another hotel or register with a host - again the 5 day period won\\'t apply). You could ask the hotel to not stamp your card, so that your previous registration is still valid during and after your hotel stay but this is technically illegal and up to the receptionist\\'s discretion. ([[user:uncle_sam01|uncle_sam01]] got his hotel stamp on a sticky note with a \"you-naughty-boy\" gesture from the receptionist...) \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Lack of and/or incorrect registration will lead to fines for you and your host, sometimes even deportation!!! (if your host had a previous guest who also screwed up their registration, they\\'d be considered a repeat offender and would face a higher fine)\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nBasically, plan your first night in Belarus with a CS host and register with them until your visa expires. If you stay at a hotel afterwards, make sure they don\\'t stamp your migration card any more. Registration sounds way scarier than it is and shouldn\\'t deter you from visiting Belarus.\\n\\n== Border crossing ==\\n\\nBelarus is neither in the [[European Union]] nor in the [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen]] Common Travel Area, and most non-[[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] nationals would require a visa to enter the country. However, since July 2018 there is a possibility to enter the country without visa for citizens of about 80 foreign countries. See \"Visa\" section. \\n\\nYou can check [http://gpk.gov.by/en/maps/ochered.php border crossing queues] and find more [http://gpk.gov.by/en/maps/ detailed info about border crossings] at the web-site of State Border Committee of the Republic of Belarus.\\n\\n=== With [[Latvia]] (from east to west)===\\n* [https://www.google.com/maps/place/55%C2%B043\\'06.5%22N+26%C2%B052\\'27.4%22E/@55.718463,26.8721013,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d55.7184603!4d26.8742901?hl=en Urbany (BLR) / Silene (LV)] (bel.

Shortly after it crosses the ring there is a good spot: There is a junction, where all the eastbound traffic from the ring joins. One may ask waiting drivers at the traffic lights or stand beside the road after that, because it is not a motorway yet. Drivers can see you there and go slow because normally everyone has to stop at the traffic lights, and there is a broad hard shoulder and bus stops, where one can safely stop and continue.

It\\'s the capital city of the [[Aquitaine]] region.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\nBordeaux is encircled by a ring road (\\'\\'rocade\\'\\' in french), a fast dual-carriageway bypass, with no places to stop and pick up hitchhikers, and peages are far and not easy to reach by walking or public transport. This makes leaving Bordeaux very tricky, although not impossible. It is best to hitchhike on the approach roads to the ring road in the direction you wish to travel. It is advised to avoid going into the town centre.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Tours]], [[Paris]] ===\\n\\nTotal gas station on the ring road\\n\\nTake the tram A to Gravières stop. Follow the street Rue des Gravières/Rue François Villon which is on the right hand side just before the tram arrives at the stop from the city centre. At a big crossroad, go left down the big crossing road named Avenue de Paris. There is a small road parallel of this street in the industrial estate, take it (rue Jean Raymond Guyon). It ends to a roundabout but here is a small old pedestrian road. Take it. Cross the bridge that crosses the motorway. From it, you can see two Total gas station on different sides of the road. The fences are broken so you can walk easily to the furthest one away for the North (Paris, etc.)\\n\\nAsk for going to the next BP gas station, just before “Saint André de Cubzac” if nobody takes the A10. At the next petrol station, there is a restaurant, so a lot more people.\\n\\nFor the south one can use the first service station seen from the pedestrian bridge.\\n\\n=== East towards Perigeux, [[Clermont-Ferrand]], [[Lyon]] ===\\n\\nA big outward road leads from the city center over bridges over the Dordogne, over the ring motorway and later becomes the motorway A 89 (E 70) to the east. Shortly after it crosses the ring there is a good spot: There is a junction, where all the eastbound traffic from the ring joins. One may ask waiting drivers at the traffic lights or stand beside the road after that, because it is not a motorway yet. Drivers can see you there and go slow because normally everyone has to stop at the traffic lights, and there is a broad hard shoulder and bus stops, where one can safely stop and continue. A few hundred meters further there is also a small dedicated fStation Carrefour Lormont Fuel station on that road\\n\\nTo get there on public transit, take the purple line A (both lines to Dravemont or La Gardette bassens work) from the city center to the stop Buttinière. The line follows a big avenue (Avenue Carnot) for roughly 3km. At Buttinière you get out and walk along that same Avenue Carnot for another 1-1.5km passing on your left first the Polyclinique de Bordeaux then a gigantic Carrefour supermarket and stop lights. \\n\\n=== South towards [[Bayonne]], [[Toulouse]], [[Barcelona]] ([[Spain]]) ===\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\' Total gas station on the ring road\\n\\nTake the tram A to Gravières stop.

For the south one can use the first service station seen from the pedestrian bridge.\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nCloser to the entrance of the highway. Take the bus #15 towards \"Villenave d\\'Ornon\" and exit at \"Pont de la Maye\" (you can ask the bus driver to tell you when it is). Then, walk in the same direction that the bus went, on the road. Cross the bridge above the road. Just after the bridge there is a little grassy hill on the right. Walk down the hill. You\\'ll arrive on a roundabout with a road going directly to A62 ([[Toulouse]]). There is some space on the roundabout so the cars can stop and pick you up relatively easily. \\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nYou can take the tram B towards Pessac Centre and get off at Montaigne-Montesquieu stop. Then you can walk through the Ecole D\\'architecture university to this spot: \\'\\'see map\\'\\' {{Coords|44.7919076|-0.6069205|1}}. The cars there will most probably take the A63 that goes south. There is a bus stop (Ecole d\\'architecture) where you can stand with a sign and the cars will have space to stop and don\\'t go very fast. You can choose a bus stop Ecole de Management, which is just before university\\n\\n\\n== Public transport ==\\n\\nIn the tramway, there are very few controls, but there is no way to avoid the control when it happens.

Lunga and sos. Cristianului (Bartolomeu area) to the bridge. You can reach Bartolomeu from the center by buses number 28 and 5.Definitely use a sign reading \"Sibiu\".

When you reach the bus station, named \"Gara Hărman\", stop there and hitchhike with your sign from the bus station where there is plenty of space for a car or a truck to stop.

Showing a sign to cars stopped by the red light should work.\\n\\nThe highway M8 does run through the city of Glasgow and if one follows the way out of the Buchanan Bus Station , and then left on red light, past the university there one can see the road converging into the highway and could have been a good spot for hitch hiking but needs to be tried and tested.\\n\\n=== Direction [[Stirling]] ===\\nGet a train to Stepps. Walk out of the station over the bridge and turn right (north west) along the A80, continue to the roundabout with the big grassy \"pyramids\" where the [[M80 (GB)|M80]] joins the \\'\\'\\'A80\\'\\'\\'. Carefully cross the roundabout and stand on the \\'\\'\\'A80\\'\\'\\' Stirling exit, a little way forward from the [[lay-by]] by the golf cub where cars (but not trucks) can pull in. It\\'s not perfect, cars don\\'t have much time to see you and stop, but it usually works for me.\\n\\nIf you are going further than Stirling, don\\'t write Stirling on your sign. \\nHitching north from Stirling to Perth, Dundee, Aberdeen etc. is very difficult.\\n\\n=== Direction Loch Lomond, West Scotland ===\\nWalk down the Great Western Road for about a mile, heading west from the motorway. About 10 minutes after passing the Glasgow Botanical Gardens, there\\'s a BP petrol station on your left hand side. A lot of traffic from here will be heading out of the city and up the west of Scotland. Don\\'t get here too late, though, because a lot of the traffic is constituted by tourists. You can also use the petrol station as a lay-by and stand at the junction with traffic lights about 30 meters down the road.\\n\\nOr you can get a train from Glasgow Queen Street to Balloch (about 4 quid; it\\'s easy to get there for free if you show willingness to pay, but only have a quid or two). Come out of the station and turn right up the \\'\\'\\'A811\\'\\'\\' Lomond Road. You\\'ll come to a roundabout that joins with the \\'\\'\\'A82\\'\\'\\' - the main road heading north from here. Take a right at the roundabout and there\\'s a lay-by a little way up on the the left hand side.\\n\\n=== Direction South ([[England]], [[Liverpool]], [[London]],[[Peebles / Galashiels]]) ===\\n==== Option 1 ====\\nGet the bus 255 from the Buchanan bus station, and step off on Uddinston Road junction with Fallside Road just before Bothwell (next to a church).  Walk down Fallside Rd. until you get to the motorway and Uddingston services, quite busy with traffic heading South. The bus takes about an hour, and the walk 20 minutes, so it might be better to take the train to Uddingston (15min) and then do the 35min walk from there to the services. It\\'s best to hold a sign with the motorway number (AKA [[M74 (GB)|M74]], [[M6 (GB)|M6]]) or to approach drivers and ask. \\nThough being a very good option to get sure, fast and long distance lifts, be aware that the bus is very expensive! 4.75£, and difficult to blackride.\\n\\n==== Option 2 ====\\nIt is also, according to local hitchhikers, quite possible to hitch south by walking down N. Hannover St from Buchanan Bus Station, turn left at Cahedral St and then left again at Stirling St and walk until you get to the lights just before the motorway onramp, bear in mind that people go all different directions from here, west , east, south etc, so a sign and taking any lift going to Uddingston/Hamilton (where there are service areas) but being aware of shorter lifts might be a good idea, also if you try this option do come back and update this article.\\n\\nWill & Reed tried Option 2 in Oct. 2015 and had little luck. The bus lane is quite congested before the lights making it difficult to even see the cars as they make the turn.\\n\\n==== Option 3 ====\\nSo this option requires some back-tracking, but it seems like your best bet! Take the Megabus/900 Bus to Edinburgh (very easy to Blackride {see below] or just a couple of pounds) and ask the driver to let you out at the Harthill Services (the bus will pull off regardless but may not stop if you don\\'t tell the driver). From there, cross over the A1 on the bridge and wait at the service station. \\n\\n==== Option 4 ====\\nThe fourth option, which I tried and which may work for you, although I had no luck after waiting for 2,5 hours is the parking lane and the parking facility directly in front of the sliproad to the M74 [https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/House+of+Sher/@55.8524509,-4.2694017,18z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x3ff2a7b95b2c9cad!8m2!3d55.8525244!4d-4.2672122]. The place could be called ideal, as every traffic on your side of the road goes to the M74 in the right direction and there are often a lot of free spaces on the parking lane. If you walk down to the traffic lights, drivers can see you truning from both directions on to the M74.\\nOne of the most ideal places for hitchhiking I`ve ever tried. \\n\\n==== For going to Galashiels or Peebles ====\\nOne option proposed is to go to Edinburgh using the 900 Bus ( use megabus uk website for 5 pounds or lesser tickets to Edinburgh or see above) then in Ediburgh walk down to North Bridge take bus number 29 / Bus 49 to Eskbank, Tesco ( in Dalkeith ) { 1.5 pounds only } . Here go on A7 and hitch hike to Galashiels . On this route there are cars which also head to Peebles. Though it may seem a little longer, but its a faster and sure way to reach Galashiels or Peebles, which otherwise you may just be stuck on some country side road where people are just trying to reach to the next village and not going anywhere near your destination.\\n\\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\\n[[trash:Glasgow]] [[nomad:Glasgow]]\\n\\n{{IsIn|Scotland}}\\n\\n[[Category:Scotland]]\\n[[Category:E5]]\\n[[Category:E16]]',\n",

Showing a sign to cars stopped by the red light should work.\\n\\nThe highway M8 does run through the city of Glasgow and if one follows the way out of the Buchanan Bus Station , and then left on red light, past the university there one can see the road converging into the highway and could have been a good spot for hitch hiking but needs to be tried and tested.\\n\\n=== Direction [[Stirling]] ===\\nGet a train to Stepps. Walk out of the station over the bridge and turn right (north west) along the A80, continue to the roundabout with the big grassy \"pyramids\" where the [[M80 (GB)|M80]] joins the \\'\\'\\'A80\\'\\'\\'. Carefully cross the roundabout and stand on the \\'\\'\\'A80\\'\\'\\' Stirling exit, a little way forward from the [[lay-by]] by the golf cub where cars (but not trucks) can pull in. It\\'s not perfect, cars don\\'t have much time to see you and stop, but it usually works for me.\\n\\nIf you are going further than Stirling, don\\'t write Stirling on your sign. \\nHitching north from Stirling to Perth, Dundee, Aberdeen etc. is very difficult.\\n\\n=== Direction Loch Lomond, West Scotland ===\\nWalk down the Great Western Road for about a mile, heading west from the motorway. About 10 minutes after passing the Glasgow Botanical Gardens, there\\'s a BP petrol station on your left hand side. A lot of traffic from here will be heading out of the city and up the west of Scotland. Don\\'t get here too late, though, because a lot of the traffic is constituted by tourists. You can also use the petrol station as a lay-by and stand at the junction with traffic lights about 30 meters down the road.\\n\\nOr you can get a train from Glasgow Queen Street to Balloch (about 4 quid; it\\'s easy to get there for free if you show willingness to pay, but only have a quid or two). Come out of the station and turn right up the \\'\\'\\'A811\\'\\'\\' Lomond Road. You\\'ll come to a roundabout that joins with the \\'\\'\\'A82\\'\\'\\' - the main road heading north from here. Take a right at the roundabout and there\\'s a lay-by a little way up on the the left hand side.\\n\\n=== Direction South ([[England]], [[Liverpool]], [[London]],[[Peebles / Galashiels]]) ===\\n==== Option 1 ====\\nGet the bus 255 from the Buchanan bus station, and step off on Uddinston Road junction with Fallside Road just before Bothwell (next to a church).  Walk down Fallside Rd. until you get to the motorway and Uddingston services, quite busy with traffic heading South. The bus takes about an hour, and the walk 20 minutes, so it might be better to take the train to Uddingston (15min) and then do the 35min walk from there to the services. It\\'s best to hold a sign with the motorway number (AKA [[M74 (GB)|M74]], [[M6 (GB)|M6]]) or to approach drivers and ask. \\nThough being a very good option to get sure, fast and long distance lifts, be aware that the bus is very expensive! 4.75£, and difficult to blackride.\\n\\n==== Option 2 ====\\nIt is also, according to local hitchhikers, quite possible to hitch south by walking down N. Hannover St from Buchanan Bus Station, turn left at Cahedral St and then left again at Stirling St and walk until you get to the lights just before the motorway onramp, bear in mind that people go all different directions from here, west , east, south etc, so a sign and taking any lift going to Uddingston/Hamilton (where there are service areas) but being aware of shorter lifts might be a good idea, also if you try this option do come back and update this article.\\n\\nWill & Reed tried Option 2 in Oct. 2015 and had little luck. The bus lane is quite congested before the lights making it difficult to even see the cars as they make the turn.\\n\\n==== Option 3 ====\\nSo this option requires some back-tracking, but it seems like your best bet! Take the Megabus/900 Bus to Edinburgh (very easy to Blackride {see below] or just a couple of pounds) and ask the driver to let you out at the Harthill Services (the bus will pull off regardless but may not stop if you don\\'t tell the driver). From there, cross over the A1 on the bridge and wait at the service station. \\n\\n==== Option 4 ====\\nThe fourth option, which I tried and which may work for you, although I had no luck after waiting for 2,5 hours is the parking lane and the parking facility directly in front of the sliproad to the M74 [{{Coords|55.8524509|-4.2694017}}]. The place could be called ideal, as every traffic on your side of the road goes to the M74 in the right direction and there are often a lot of free spaces on the parking lane. If you walk down to the traffic lights, drivers can see you truning from both directions on to the M74.\\nOne of the most ideal places for hitchhiking I`ve ever tried. \\n\\n==== For going to Galashiels or Peebles ====\\nOne option proposed is to go to Edinburgh using the 900 Bus ( use megabus uk website for 5 pounds or lesser tickets to Edinburgh or see above) then in Ediburgh walk down to North Bridge take bus number 29 / Bus 49 to Eskbank, Tesco ( in Dalkeith ) { 1.5 pounds only } . Here go on A7 and hitch hike to Galashiels . On this route there are cars which also head to Peebles. Though it may seem a little longer, but its a faster and sure way to reach Galashiels or Peebles, which otherwise you may just be stuck on some country side road where people are just trying to reach to the next village and not going anywhere near your destination.\\n\\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\\n[[trash:Glasgow]] [[nomad:Glasgow]]\\n\\n{{IsIn|Scotland}}\\n\\n[[Category:Scotland]]\\n[[Category:E5]]\\n[[Category:E16]]'},\n",

In \\'\\'\\'religious neighborhoods\\'\\'\\', it can be perceived as offensive not to dress modestly, and can attract unwelcomed attention.

Make plastic card \"Rav Kav\\', otherwise you can\\'t pay. It\\'s free and possible to make in the CBS and another spots\\n\\n== Hitching out ==\\n__TOC__\\n[[File:CraigIsraelKfarAdomim.jpg|thumb|220px|right|[[User:Halt, Stop! Reudnitz kommt.|Craig]] at Maale Adumim Junction en route to Dead Sea (5 mins).]]\\n[Moriya:] Jerusalem has at least 6-7 roads to get out,to different directions. It\\'s changes often by the massive constractions but in general, choose your next destination and ask local where the best spot to hitch out. the following is list of spots based on the direction:\\n\\n\\n== MAIN Junction to get out: ==\\n\"Hayeziaa Me\\'A\\'ir\"- The enternace of the city, called as well Ginot Sacharov. ([https://goo.gl/maps/i8hDtLdz8tu Google street view]) 1 road, the huge Trempiyada that close to the CBS. it\\'s the road to Tel Aviv, Haifa and all Gush Dan, and the way to the states highways- 2, 6.. If you come from city center, you walk through tram lines to the ugly bridge, and down the bridge you continue straight.you will see 2 crossroads and on your right will be to petrols stations- yellow one and one call Sonol. Keep staright. you will see huge place to stand, bus statins and often tons of people that hitch hike too. find your spot and stand. Most likely you will see other hitchhikers standing there too. If you get bored or want to burn some time, just behind you there is an old Arab village (Lifta), which was deserted in 1948. Go down the stairs and find your way to the local spring. Although basicly from this spot people go to all the country, not many people stop, and you may stuck inside all the traffic jams. So if you want easyer, beautyer and often shorter way to south or north, use another way. \\n\\nHitch hike to Tel Aviv on road 443: You can stand at French Hill just in the other side of the tram of Givat Hamivtar. This is not the best spot to hitch towards Tel Aviv - use it only if you hitched here from the Dead Sea, northern Israel or from the West bank, and you wish to continue to Tel Aviv. On the other side of the big intersection there is a smaller bus stop. Cars that pass here might be going into Jerusalem, or towards Tel Aviv through highway 1 or highway 443, so a sign here can be a big help. There are no good places to stop on highway 1 except the  Hemed station and Latrun intersection.  It’s better to wait for a direct ride. If you can get a ride part of the way on highway 443, to Modiin for example, that is much better, because there are bus stops in almost every intersection on that road.\\n\\n== To the north, south and Dead sea: ==\\n\\nJerusalem locate, geographicly in the excat center of Israel, which explaines why to hitch hike to nirth and south is the same spot. for years, the best way was through the Trempiyada in French hill, but roads changed and people barely stop there nowdays .(2018) Currently spot is the station to Maa\\'le Adumim that close to the Hebrew Uni. From city center- take the tram to Ammunition Hill, \\'\\'or\\'\\' you hitchhike from in front the Damascus gate (sounds strange, but worked numerous times: 10 mins, 5 mins). Get down, cross the road to the right, you can see huge white stutue on your left. Keep it on your left.  and start walk, You will walk like 15 minutes. Than you will see station that have many buses that stop. Check if it\\'s written that there is a bus that go to Kfar Adumim. if the answer iis yes- than you are in the right staation. Take a lift to Kfar Adumim (or further) you will pass Maale Adumim, and Mishor Adumim. when you get down, you will see that you are in road 1#. all the lifts good for you, try to get to Bet Haarava junction, where road 1 meets highway 90, which can take you north towards Beit She\\'an, Tiberias and generally northern Israel (serving also Allenby border crossing and Sheikh Hussein border crossing to Amman) and south towards the Dead Sea and Eilat.\\nSo if you need to get to the Dead Sea and your ride goes to northern Israel (Beit She\\'an, Tiberias etc.) or vice versa, get off at the last junction before Beit HaArava - at Almog junction. Almog junction functions as a refreshment stop, so kiosks, mini-market and (free) toilets are available here, so that\\'s the best way to hitch another ride. Beware! this is a desert area, so being near a refreshment stop helps.\\n\\n== To the west bank- north area: Binyamin and Samaria sttelments, Nablus and cet: ==\\n\\nCheck the section of [[west bank]] for more detalis, but anyways, from Jerusalem: French Hill used to be the best spots, but it\\'s changed (2018). Nowdays the Trempiyada is in Hizma Junction. take the tram to Sayert Duchifat (almost last station), get down and take the crossroad to your right. there is a station, not so good spot but for lazy people you can hitch hike there insted of walk 20 minutes down in the road to Hizma junction. every lift is good to Hizma Junction, and sometime you will get lift straight to your destination. Hizma Junction is a soldiers checkpoint, you will see many people standing there. Sign can help and watch the que.The people that stop will be 90% of the time religius setllers, so if you want to go to Rammalla cheeck where excatly you need to get down to coninue, and be aware that people will not like the idea you go there, and can\\'t give you ride straight to there, due the politics issues. You can hitch from the same place towards Ramallah (and from there you can reach Nablus and other Palestinian cities). Be advised that if you’re standing in this stop with a sign that says “Ramallah” on it, it\\'s quite possible people are going to look at you like you’re crazy, and might try to convince you not to go there, that it’s dangerous, etc. \\nIt\\'s almost secret but you can even hitch hike to Netania, Tel Aviv, Haifa from this stop if you heading to Samaria (through 60 road, 5, 6) but it longer and you will need many lifts. Rides from here are available to the Ramallah area ([[Ramallah]], [[Ofra]], etc.) As well as further in, towards [[Nablus]], via \"Tapuach Junction\" ([[Ariel]], [[Salfit]], [[Buddya]] etc.)\\nThe buses to this area are really cheap (sometime 3 shekels!) so check where you need exactly to go and your time- maybe bus is better..\\n\\n== To the west bank- south- Gush Ezyon, Hebron, Beer Sheva ==\\n\\nSame rules about the [[west bank]] section. \\n\\nTake bus to Gilo (71, 31, 30..) get down in Afarsemon street. cross to the left, you will see huge road, on the left there is Trempiyada. If you need to Go to Hebron, ask people where exactly to stand. If you not sure where to get down ask the driver, where is the Gush Ezyon\\'s Trempiyada.\\n\\n \\nTo Tekoa (Gush Ezyon) : take the bus to Har Homa (Homat Shmuel) 74, 75. Get down in Shmuel Meir-Kvish 378. It\\'s the same way to Bet Lechem, but Israelies car not aloud to go there, and arabs not aloud to do the way around.A bus ride to Bethlehem only costs 8 NIS, consider using the bus. Bus #231 or #234 can be taken from the bus terminal in front of Damscus gate of the Old City of Jerusalem. You can hitch a ride to  [[Gush Etzion Junction]] and continue from there to most of the villages in Gush Etzion or on to Hebron and Kiryat Arba.\\n\\n\\nThough, to get to the Hebron or Kiryat Arba, there is a bus #381 which costs just 8.1 NIS. \\n\\n\\nYou can consider to walk instead of HH. Jerusalem to Bethlem is just 8 km. I\\'ve done it in less than 2 hours walking slow and take my time. The view is not the best but if you arrive walking you will able to see the big wall which it separetes Israel to the West Bank. You have to take the entrance for tourists,very fast, few people pass there. The palestinian pass by another gate. Above all you will see the wall and read the different stories of the palestinian during the occupation and you will see many grafitti on the wall, some of them were made by Bansky. Bansky\\'s graffitti are spread around Jerusalem but if you go to the center the (annoyng) taxies will take you to a tour to see Bansky\\'s graffiti.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n[[Category:\\n\\n[[Category:Palestinian Territory]]',\n",

In \\'\\'\\'religious neighborhoods\\'\\'\\', it can be perceived as offensive not to dress modestly, and can attract unwelcomed attention. However, in the city center and old city (not inside the religious sites themselves, obviously) there is no such problem.\\nYou can hitch hike in the nighbourhods, just find deserted stations and try. most of the city are walkable and the buses are cheap. Make plastic card \"Rav Kav\\', otherwise you can\\'t pay. It\\'s free and possible to make in the CBS and another spots\\n\\n== Hitching out ==\\n__TOC__\\n[[File:CraigIsraelKfarAdomim.jpg|thumb|220px|right|[[User:Halt, Stop! Reudnitz kommt.|Craig]] at Maale Adumim Junction en route to Dead Sea (5 mins).]]\\n[Moriya:] Jerusalem has at least 6-7 roads to get out,to different directions. It\\'s changes often by the massive constractions but in general, choose your next destination and ask local where the best spot to hitch out. the following is list of spots based on the direction:\\n\\n\\n== MAIN Junction to get out: ==\\n\"Hayeziaa Me\\'A\\'ir\"- The enternace of the city, called as well Ginot Sacharov. (\\'\\'Google street view\\'\\' {{Coords|31.7913627|35.1966262|1}}) 1 road, the huge Trempiyada that close to the CBS. it\\'s the road to Tel Aviv, Haifa and all Gush Dan, and the way to the states highways- 2, 6.. If you come from city center, you walk through tram lines to the ugly bridge, and down the bridge you continue straight.you will see 2 crossroads and on your right will be to petrols stations- yellow one and one call Sonol. Keep staright. you will see huge place to stand, bus statins and often tons of people that hitch hike too. find your spot and stand. Most likely you will see other hitchhikers standing there too. If you get bored or want to burn some time, just behind you there is an old Arab village (Lifta), which was deserted in 1948. Go down the stairs and find your way to the local spring. Although basicly from this spot people go to all the country, not many people stop, and you may stuck inside all the traffic jams. So if you want easyer, beautyer and often shorter way to south or north, use another way. \\n\\nHitch hike to Tel Aviv on road 443: You can stand at French Hill just in the other side of the tram of Givat Hamivtar. This is not the best spot to hitch towards Tel Aviv - use it only if you hitched here from the Dead Sea, northern Israel or from the West bank, and you wish to continue to Tel Aviv. On the other side of the big intersection there is a smaller bus stop. Cars that pass here might be going into Jerusalem, or towards Tel Aviv through highway 1 or highway 443, so a sign here can be a big help. There are no good places to stop on highway 1 except the  Hemed station and Latrun intersection.  It’s better to wait for a direct ride. If you can get a ride part of the way on highway 443, to Modiin for example, that is much better, because there are bus stops in almost every intersection on that road.\\n\\n== To the north, south and Dead sea: ==\\n\\nJerusalem locate, geographicly in the excat center of Israel, which explaines why to hitch hike to nirth and south is the same spot. for years, the best way was through the Trempiyada in French hill, but roads changed and people barely stop there nowdays .(2018) Currently spot is the station to Maa\\'le Adumim that close to the Hebrew Uni. From city center- take the tram to Ammunition Hill, \\'\\'or\\'\\' you hitchhike from in front the Damascus gate (sounds strange, but worked numerous times: 10 mins, 5 mins). Get down, cross the road to the right, you can see huge white stutue on your left. Keep it on your left.  and start walk, You will walk like 15 minutes. Than you will see station that have many buses that stop. Check if it\\'s written that there is a bus that go to Kfar Adumim. if the answer iis yes- than you are in the right staation. Take a lift to Kfar Adumim (or further) you will pass Maale Adumim, and Mishor Adumim. when you get down, you will see that you are in road 1#. all the lifts good for you, try to get to Bet Haarava junction, where road 1 meets highway 90, which can take you north towards Beit She\\'an, Tiberias and generally northern Israel (serving also Allenby border crossing and Sheikh Hussein border crossing to Amman) and south towards the Dead Sea and Eilat.\\nSo if you need to get to the Dead Sea and your ride goes to northern Israel (Beit She\\'an, Tiberias etc.) or vice versa, get off at the last junction before Beit HaArava - at Almog junction. Almog junction functions as a refreshment stop, so kiosks, mini-market and (free) toilets are available here, so that\\'s the best way to hitch another ride. Beware! this is a desert area, so being near a refreshment stop helps.\\n\\n== To the west bank- north area: Binyamin and Samaria sttelments, Nablus and cet: ==\\n\\nCheck the section of [[west bank]] for more detalis, but anyways, from Jerusalem: French Hill used to be the best spots, but it\\'s changed (2018). Nowdays the Trempiyada is in Hizma Junction. take the tram to Sayert Duchifat (almost last station), get down and take the crossroad to your right. there is a station, not so good spot but for lazy people you can hitch hike there insted of walk 20 minutes down in the road to Hizma junction. every lift is good to Hizma Junction, and sometime you will get lift straight to your destination. Hizma Junction is a soldiers checkpoint, you will see many people standing there. Sign can help and watch the que.The people that stop will be 90% of the time religius setllers, so if you want to go to Rammalla cheeck where excatly you need to get down to coninue, and be aware that people will not like the idea you go there, and can\\'t give you ride straight to there, due the politics issues. You can hitch from the same place towards Ramallah (and from there you can reach Nablus and other Palestinian cities). Be advised that if you’re standing in this stop with a sign that says “Ramallah” on it, it\\'s quite possible people are going to look at you like you’re crazy, and might try to convince you not to go there, that it’s dangerous, etc. \\nIt\\'s almost secret but you can even hitch hike to Netania, Tel Aviv, Haifa from this stop if you heading to Samaria (through 60 road, 5, 6) but it longer and you will need many lifts. Rides from here are available to the Ramallah area ([[Ramallah]], [[Ofra]], etc.) As well as further in, towards [[Nablus]], via \"Tapuach Junction\" ([[Ariel]], [[Salfit]], [[Buddya]] etc.)\\nThe buses to this area are really cheap (sometime 3 shekels!) so check where you need exactly to go and your time- maybe bus is better..\\n\\n== To the west bank- south- Gush Ezyon, Hebron, Beer Sheva ==\\n\\nSame rules about the [[west bank]] section. \\n\\nTake bus to Gilo (71, 31, 30..) get down in Afarsemon street. cross to the left, you will see huge road, on the left there is Trempiyada. If you need to Go to Hebron, ask people where exactly to stand. If you not sure where to get down ask the driver, where is the Gush Ezyon\\'s Trempiyada.\\n\\n \\nTo Tekoa (Gush Ezyon) : take the bus to Har Homa (Homat Shmuel) 74, 75. Get down in Shmuel Meir-Kvish 378. It\\'s the same way to Bet Lechem, but Israelies car not aloud to go there, and arabs not aloud to do the way around.A bus ride to Bethlehem only costs 8 NIS, consider using the bus. Bus #231 or #234 can be taken from the bus terminal in front of Damscus gate of the Old City of Jerusalem. You can hitch a ride to  [[Gush Etzion Junction]] and continue from there to most of the villages in Gush Etzion or on to Hebron and Kiryat Arba.\\n\\n\\nThough, to get to the Hebron or Kiryat Arba, there is a bus #381 which costs just 8.1 NIS. \\n\\n\\nYou can consider to walk instead of HH. Jerusalem to Bethlem is just 8 km. I\\'ve done it in less than 2 hours walking slow and take my time. The view is not the best but if you arrive walking you will able to see the big wall which it separetes Israel to the West Bank. You have to take the entrance for tourists,very fast, few people pass there. The palestinian pass by another gate. Above all you will see the wall and read the different stories of the palestinian during the occupation and you will see many grafitti on the wall, some of them were made by Bansky. Bansky\\'s graffitti are spread around Jerusalem but if you go to the center the (annoyng) taxies will take you to a tour to see Bansky\\'s graffiti.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n[[Category:\\n\\n[[Category:Palestinian Territory]]'},\n",

Medvode), or 8 (dir. Gameljne) from the city centre. If people who pick you up don\\'t go as far as you like, you can get a lift as far as the first \"Petrol\" gas station on the highway (17km away) or the former toll station Torovo and keep hitchhiking there. There is also a petrol station at the Radovljica-exit (right before Bled) which is useful for getting into Austria. Another option is to get dropped  at ~25km from Šentvid, there\\'s a great hitchhiking spot [https://goo.gl/maps/d4kMoNHzbEYPRT9d7 here] on a ramp where there\\'s enough room for a car to stop (GPS 46.267470, 14.339623).\\n\\n=== Southwest towards [[Koper]], [[Nova Gorica]], [[Rijeka]], [[Pula]] ([[Croatia]]), ([[Italy]]) {{E|61}} ===\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1: Rest stop Barje - North (Avtocestno počivališče Barje - Sever)\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nCatch bus 1 to bus stop \"Tbilisijska\", continue walking in the same direction and turn left at the roundabout. Follow the road for a few more minutes and cross the meadow to reach the rest stop. Alot of cars and trucks are going to Italy from here, easy to get a ride west. Just ask people at the gas station.\\nThere is a shower in fuel station for 3 eur and places for wild camping around.\\n\\nIf your destination is Venice or further, the easiest way is via Nova Gorica (town on the walkable distance from Gorizia, Italy): use sign GO and ask to be dropped at the service area on the border. For Trieste it doesn\\'t work well with TS sign - best option might be to use Koper sign and then ask the driver to drop you off at Kozina exit (go right in the crossroads after toll booths). It\\'s only 3 km from the border and on the main Rijeka-Trieste road.\\n\\nIf your destination is Rijeka, take also rides going to Postojna or further west. Get out at Postojna exit and walk across the highway from there (use the bridge). There is a good spot to hitchhike southwards just few hundred meters after the bridge.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2: Highway entrance Dolgi Most\\'\\'\\'\\n\\n[[File:DSCI0054.JPG|right|thumb|334px|Hitchhiking spot \\'\\'Dolgi most\\'\\']]\\n\\nFrom the city centre (Dunajska cesta, Slovenska cesta) take the bus number 6, 1, 1D (direction Dolgi most) or 6B (dir. Notranje gorice), to bus stop \"Dolgi Most\". You will be dropped off on a large parking lot right next to a motorway bridge. There is also a Bicike(lj) (bike rental) station nearby, if you prefer it to taking the bus. On the opposite side of the road, there is a busy motorway entrance with a great hitchhiking spot where cars can easily see you and stop safely.\\n\\nApril 2024: After the reconstruction the entrance is not as good for hichhiking as before, since drivers need to turn into a \"locals only\" street. Nevertheless it is still a safe spot with a lot of passing traffic.\\n\\nSeptember 2024: I was able to get a ride to Postonja from here within 5 minutes in a rainstorm. It looked like a not very ideal spot but it worked. The above mentioned spot in Postonja worked very well for getting towards Rijeka. If you do not feel comfortable crossing the bridge in a sidewalk or shoulder (which I didn\\'t want to do in a rainstorm) it\\'s possible with a roughly 40 minute diversion to find a pedestrian underpass to the west and then looping down to the above-mentioned spot.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3: Fuel station on the road to highway\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nNear the crossing of streets: \"Pot Na Rakovo Jelšo\" and \"Barjanska Cesta\" there is a fuel station with a lot of cars heading towards Koper.\\n\\n=== Southeast towards [[Novo mesto]], [[Zagreb]] ([[Croatia]]) {{Aat|2}} ===\\n\\n[[File:Hhspottowardszagreb.jpg|right|thumb|334px|Hitchhiking spot for direction: Zagreb]]\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1: Rest stop Barje - South (Jug)\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nThis service area is on the Ring around Ljubljana and is very well-served by a lot of long-distance drivers. To get there take a bus number 1 or 1B in direction of \"Dolgi most\" from the center. Get off the bus on the stop \"Mestni Log\" and walk back in the direction of the highway. When you reach the overpass look for a very small and steep pathway on your right, starting next to the overpass. Descend down to the fence, turn right and walk a few metres untill you reach an unlocked door. When you\\'re on the other side of the fence, you should already be able to see the rest stop. Follow the pathway for another 100 m or so and there you are. There is a shower for 3€, food and places for wildcamping around.\\n\\n* [[User:MartinJ888|MartinJ888]] August 2022: Works very well. The door is still unlocked! Took us about 1 hour to get a ride, asking people.\\n\\n*[[User:JackMcJackJack|JackMcJackJack]] August 2023: This gas station and has been demolished and people rarely stop here, avoid this place. The on ramp beside the Lidl on Pot Rdečega križa is a 20min walk away from Mestni Log bus station. Most people here are heading south, but we found a ride to Šmarje - Sap gas station after an hour.\\n\\nNovember 2024: Reconstruction is finished and the rest stop is open again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2: Highway entrance Barjanska cesta\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nCatch bus 9 in direction of \"Barje\" from the center or the train station and exit on the final stop \"Barje\". You can hitchhike next to the parking lot or walk down the \"barjanska\" street and try to find a better place. That\\'s the entrance people from Ljubljana would use to enter the highway going south, so this spot might be less suitable for long distance picks, but perfect to get you to Novo Mesto.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3: Highway entrance Rudnik\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nNot many cars go in this direction, and the ones that do usually do not enter the motorway here - this on-ramp mostly serves inter-urban traffic, so you might have to wait a bit longer. From the city centre take a bus line 3 in direction of \"Rudnik\", and get off at the final stop. In front of you there will be the motorway entrance. Cross the street and on the side of the on-ramp road, on your left, you will see a small asphalt surface where all the cars pass, and there you can stand and hitchhike easily. Pay attention that you\\'re hitchhiking on the highway entrance (the left turn) and not on the old road (Dolenjska cesta), which is continuing straight ahead. Drivers going to Kočevje and Ribnica use this entrance.\\n\\n== Transportation ==\\n\\nLjubljana is a very walkable and cyclable city, so those two are best options to move around. I highly recommend the bike share system \\'\\'\\'Bicike(lj)\\'\\'\\', used daily by many locals. It costs only 1€ for a weekly subscription (and 3€ for the whole year). You can use the bikes unlimitedly 24/7, the 1st hour of every use is free. Definitely the cheapest and most comfortable option, download the BicikeLJ app for use.\\nAnother option is taking the busses, payment is possible on the bus with a credit card - one 90 min ride costs 1.3€. In case of credit card payment changing the busses is not possible (every change will cost another 1.3€). Another option is to use the app Urbana or buying the city card.\\n\\n== Sleeping ==\\n\\nThe best option in a walkable distance from the city centre would be park Tivoli. It is huge so you can easily find a good place to hide and set up your tent somewhere. People often drink there in the evening so it might be a good idea to sleep in or at least close to the forest, so nobody will bother you.\\n\\nEdit: if you go to the forest behind Tivoli, be prepared for it is steep. Go there during daylight and plan in enough time to find a suitable spot. If you go until the bag side of the park (just before the forest starts) and go west you\\'ll reach a little staircase out of stone. Climb it and you\\'ll find a calm spot to spend the night \\n\\nAnother place is up the castle, close to the antena. Just follow the path going away from the castle entrance and it will take you to a small meadow and a small forrest. There is a bigger chance to be spotted here.\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[[Category:Slovenia]]\\n[[Category:E70]]\\n[[Category:E61]]\\n[[Category:E57]]\\n\\n[[de:Ljubljana]]',\n",

Walk towards the motorway which you can see from the train station and take the first road right alongside the fields. After 5 minutes you will come to the petrol station fence. You can climb over the locked fence, but the top is spiked. It\\'s better to turn right, and walk along the fence for about 250 metres, and climb over it at the first section with a stone-wall.

Cars can pull over just before the traffic lights, or at the sliproad. You can get a ride straight to Brussels, or to the above mentioned [[Capellen]] gas station (\\'\\'aire de Capellen\\'\\'), which is just about 10km down the road, and from there you can get rides to about anywhere in Belgium and the Netherlands.\\n\\n====Service station for Liege and the Netherlands====\\nYou have the option of going to the town of [[Martelange]] . This small town is famous for plenty of drivers due to the cheap fuel provided by dozens of service stations for drivers going to the Belgian Limburg, Dutch Limburg, and Aachen, etc. Get train from Luxembourg city station to Arlon. Walk left out of station, keep following the Bastogne road signs towards a roundabout which is a 20 minute walk.

Turn left at the cabin closest to you and walk further up the hill until you reach another crossing under the massive motorway bridge. Go right at this and keep climbing the hill until you reach a more developed road. Here, you turn right and keep following the access road until you reach the petrol station.

Take the first little path to the residential area (\\'\\'Rue Oscar Romero\\'\\'), pass a tiny roundabout and walk up towards the fields. Then you have a beautiful path through the fields straight ahead. You\\'ll pass by generous walnut and apple trees, you\\'ll have to climb over small cattle fences, and might say hi to some animals.  Otherwise: Turn left when you leave the Berchem train station, walk down the road 5 minutes and the second main road on the right is \\'\\'Rue Meckenheck\\'\\'.  Take \\'\\'Meckenheck\\'\\' up winding through a residential area all the way up to where it ends, at which point there is a big forest. Turn right onto Du Bois, and follow it curving around to the left. You should hear the highway and pretty soon you will arrive at a bridge that runs over the highway. Just before the bridge is the south-side petrol station, with loads of cars heading north towards Luxembourg city, Belgium, Netherlands and Germany. \\nWalk over the bridge and immediately at the end of it go down to the highway, through the concrete pavement or stairs, and walk 50m alongside of it until the station. \\nThere are vehicles traveling all over Europe.

Get off at the [[Capellen]] stop and walk less than 1 km west to some of the biggest petrol stations in Europe! Walk towards the motorway which you can see from the train station and take the first road right alongside the fields. After 5 minutes you will come to the petrol station fence. You can climb over the locked fence, but the top is spiked. It\\'s better to turn right, and walk along the fence for about 250 metres, and climb over it at the first section with a stone-wall. Many truck drivers use this service station.\\n\\n====Motorway exit for Brussels====\\n{{Coords|49.6184|6.0844}}<br>\\nFollow the \\'\\'Route d\\'Arlon\\'\\' to the entry onto the A6/{{E|25}}. This is a walk of about 4km from the town centre. You can also just take the Bus 28 and hop off at \\'\\'Hondseck\\'\\', or the Bus 22 and walk from \\'\\'Maternité\\'\\' (no need for a ticket ). Cars can pull over just before the traffic lights, or at the sliproad. You can get a ride straight to Brussels, or to the above mentioned [[Capellen]] gas station (\\'\\'aire de Capellen\\'\\'), which is just about 10km down the road, and from there you can get rides to about anywhere in Belgium and the Netherlands.\\n\\n====Service station for Liege and the Netherlands====\\nYou have the option of going to the town of [[Martelange]] . This small town is famous for plenty of drivers due to the cheap fuel provided by dozens of service stations for drivers going to the Belgian Limburg, Dutch Limburg, and Aachen, etc. Get train from Luxembourg city station to Arlon. Walk left out of station, keep following the Bastogne road signs towards a roundabout which is a 20 minute walk. Here you can hitchhikin at the junction after the bridge and across from the Fiat car garage. This road goes to Martelange and the North.\\n\\n=== East ([[Trier]], [[Germany]]) ===\\n====The better option====\\nJust walk out of the centre to the \\'\\'Avenue John Fitzgerald Kennedy\\'\\' in direction \\'\\'Kirchberg\\'\\'. You will find many banks, institutes and the Luxembourg fair (LuxExpo) there. You can hitch on every spot where cars can stop on this road and even in side roads and secondary roads which are leading to this avenue. Make sure holding a \\'\\'Trier\\'\\' sign. There are masses of people from \\'\\'Trier\\'\\' working in Luxembourg Kirchberg and especially on working days you won\\'t have to wait long. Hold a \\'\\'Trier\\'\\' sign even if you want to get further, if this is the case, you can be dropped at [[Wasserbillig]] service station on the motorway A1 (see The train option). A sign is very important for making the people from Trier stop, which will be your drivers here.\\n\\nTake the Bus 16 or tram to the stop just before the airport. This stop is next to an entrance to the highway and you can either stand in front of the bus stop with a sign or stand on a little traffic light island at the entrance so that you get all the traffic going towards Trier that is coming from both directions. Get a lift at least as far as the huge petrol station on the border, and then it is easier to hitch further.\\n\\n====The train option====\\n{{Coords|49.7265|6.4921}}<br>\\nGet the [[Trier]]/[[Wasserbillig]] (line 30) train from Luxembourg City station. Get off at the Wasserbillig stop. You should turn right outside the train station, walking up the road and turning left up the \\'\\'Route d\\'Echternach\\'\\' until you reach a crossing beside a big river. This option takes 30 minutes but there are beautiful views to be seen. You will notice that there is an old pathway going up the hill. If you follow this route you should arrive at two old cabins. Turn left at the cabin closest to you and walk further up the hill until you reach another crossing under the massive motorway bridge. Go right at this and keep climbing the hill until you reach a more developed road. Here, you turn right and keep following the access road until you reach the petrol station. This is located at the Luxembourg-German border. There should be plenty of international traffic.\\n\\n=== South ([[Metz]], [[France]]) (E25/A3) ===\\n{{Coords|49.5426|6.1173}}<br>\\nGet the line 60 train from Luxembourg City station. Get off at the \\'\\'Berchem\\'\\' stop. There are 2 exits from the station. Take the closest one, don\\'t take the stairs. And walk less than 2 km to some of the biggest motorway petrol stations in Europe! Take the first little path to the residential area (\\'\\'Rue Oscar Romero\\'\\'), pass a tiny roundabout and walk up towards the fields. Then you have a beautiful path through the fields straight ahead. You\\'ll pass by generous walnut and apple trees, you\\'ll have to climb over small cattle fences, and might say hi to some animals.  Otherwise: Turn left when you leave the Berchem train station, walk down the road 5 minutes and the second main road on the right is \\'\\'Rue Meckenheck\\'\\'.  Take \\'\\'Meckenheck\\'\\' up winding through a residential area all the way up to where it ends, at which point there is a big forest. Turn right onto Du Bois, and follow it curving around to the left. You should hear the highway and pretty soon you will arrive at a bridge that runs over the highway. Just before the bridge is the south-side petrol station, with loads of cars heading north towards Luxembourg city, Belgium, Netherlands and Germany. \\nWalk over the bridge and immediately at the end of it go down to the highway, through the concrete pavement or stairs, and walk 50m alongside of it until the station. \\nThere are vehicles traveling all over Europe.  You can also reach the petrol station by hitching from the roundabout that is located right at the start of the highways.\\n\\n \\'\\'\\'March 2025 update\\'\\'\\': the original bridge over the highway was demolished in 2023 and [https://www.google.com/maps/@49.5444643,6.1212696,3a,89.4y,19.89h,85.97t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1stgKhRK44OU4wb2oB9K-4Aw!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D4.030278064918235%26panoid%3DtgKhRK44OU4wb2oB9K-4Aw%26yaw%3D19.887534256622008!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDMwNC4wIKXMDSoJLDEwMjExNDUzSAFQAw%3D%3D the latest Street View imagery] shows the replacement in construction as of July 2024.

There is the highway North-West A55 that starts there (it\\'s a bridge going up so it\\'s better to stand at the traffic light just before it). A lot of the cars leaving from that point can take you out of Marseille\\'s metropolis and leave you at Fos-sur-Mer, where the road is only one-lane and it\\'s easy to get another lift. \\n\\nMetro to Bougainville station and walk to petrol station called Briançon Métro station (\\'\\'map\\'\\' {{Coords|43.3151284|5.3672314|1}}). Place is still in town\\n\\nTrain to Aéroport Marseille Provence and search for Agip fuel station on A7 highway 1 km away\\n\\n=== North or West by A7, towards A8, [[Aix-en-Provence]], [[Avignon]], [[Lyon]], or [[Nice]] ===\\n\\nTest option - Total petrolstation on A50. Go by bus 12 till stop  HLM la Rouguière. Petrol station is 300 metres away\\n\\n\\nYou can stand on the entrance to the [[L\\'Autoroute de Soleil]] (A7), 3 minutes\\' walk northwest from the central station Gare Saint Charles. From the station main entrance, follow the blue road signs.\\nGet a lift to the [[péage]], or the big [[petrol station]] \"Lançon\" and you\\'ll easily get a ride to Lyon, Montpellier or anywhere further.\\n\\n=== East to [[Nice]] and [[Italy]] and [[Toulon]] ===\\n\\nIt is highly recommended to first go north via A7 and then take the A8. The alternative - A50 east to [[Toulon]] and then up to A8 - is by far less frequented, since the highway goes directly through the city of Toulon, with traffic lights and speed limits. Stand just before the entrance of the motorway [[Toulon]], Aubagne: boulevard Rabatau, just in front of the Kyriad Hotel or Boulevard Jean Moulin, just after the last trafic light, at the entrance of the motorway which turns on the left.\\n\\nGood spot is on Bd Vincent Delpuech just before the roundabout where the A50 begins. Nice open space opposite traffic lights with an extra lane for drivers\\n\\n== Public Transportation ==\\n\\nThe metro is easy to blackride, walk through the open doors or follow somebody who is walking through the turnstiles with a ticket. People will hold open the doors for you if you have a backpack. If you see security, wait until they look away or go for a cigarette break. Buses are even easier, the drivers don\\'t check for tickets and inspectors (very rare, found sometimes around Vieux-Port) wear black-purple uniforms. The amount of purple on their uniforms is just one very thin line across their chest..so you have to look out really well. Trams are easy too, just be careful around the center and you`ll be fine. A lot of people blackride in this city.\\n\\n== Leave your bags ==\\nYou can leave your bags in supermarket LIDL (Rue Sante 71, Monday-Sunday, 9-20:00). I am not sure about other LIDL\\'s but in this one it works and it\\'s very close to city center. They have big storage boxes, that\\'s enough for your big backpack, deposit is 2 Euro. \\n\\n== Eat ==\\nNear Noailles metro station there is a food market with a lot of cheap arabic cafes. I can recommend you somme pizza cafes where you can buy big pizza for 4 Euro. Couple of good pizza cafes you can find on Rue des Feuillants.\\n\\n== Internet ==\\nYou can find computers with internet in the cenral library - Bibliotheque de l\\'Alcazar. Also they have free wi-fi, comfortable chairs, tables, sockets and toilet. You can use their wi-fi as much as you want. To use their computers you have 1 hour per each day. You need to make your own card with your personal login and password. To do it, you need any ID.  Working time Tuesday-Saturday, 11-19:00. I managed to use the computers for ~3 hrs/day by closing my session when I had 10-15mins left and then moving to another computer and opening a new session. I always had another 59mins, besides the last time, when it changed to 49mins.\\n\\nFor a quick check you can also use the computers in Office de Turisme. If you need internet for longer reaserch I recommed going to Les Terrasses du Port, it\\'s open everyday from 10.00 am to 8 pm (or even till 1 am - a part with restaurants).\\n\\n== Sleep==\\n\\nYou can find a perfect spot to pitch your tent at the green beaches (called in french Parc Balnéaire du Prado) just get the bus number 83 and get off there, you can\\'t miss it (and don\\'t even think about paying, cause you\\'ll be the only one to do that).\\nDo not do it on the beach! There are plenty of trees close by, do it there.\\nBy the way, the beach strip in this part of the city is probably the best. Good luck! {{hitchbase_city|160}}\\n\\n\\nI stayed at the above spot a few days ago; it really is in many ways a perfect spot. I was not bothered by the police, there is a grocery store (Casino), a cheap kebab place, and a cafe with wifi across the street. There are also public showers (typical outdoor cold water beach showers), which are great. However, be warned that around 4:30 AM, some sprinklers turned on and continued until about 5:30. Also a tractor combing the beach itself in the morning, so if you camp on the sand you will be woken up / run over\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n{{Cities France}}\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|Bouches-du-Rhône}}\\n\\n__NOTOC__\\n\\n[[Category:France]]\\n\\n[[de:Marseille]]\\n[[fr:Marseille]]'},\n",

It is situated within a ring road called \\'\\'le périphérique\\'\\', or \\'\\'le périph\\'\\'. The actual city is relatively small, but is surrounded by endless suburbs, which are linked to the urban public transportation system at no extra cost, as since January 2025 the Metro and the RER (suburban trains, not to be confused with Transilien trains) have a unified fare system.\\n\\nNote that there is an \"outer ring road\" to the Paris suburb area, motorway A86 (or \\'\\'super-périphérique\\'\\') and another wider ring even further called \"la Francillienne\" which isn\\'t completed but still used to connect . If your ride is not going to Paris itself, you might want to clarify which ring they are going to take as it may affect the place where you\\'d want to be dropped. You may also find them useful if you need to bypass Paris, especially the Francilienne, as it has more gas stations and less complex interchanges.\\n\\nGood to know if you\\'re starting to stink up in the City of Lights: the Municipality provides [https://www.paris.fr/pages/les-bains-douches-municipaux-138 free shower facilities ] in 17 locations around Paris. Note they are BYOT (bring your own toiletry).\\n\\n[[File:888_signs.jpg|thumb|240px|right|A small collection of the \"Paris\" signs for the [[Project 888]] where over 150 hitchhikers gathered and camped in front of the Eiffel Tower.]]\\n\\n== Hitching in ==\\n\\nDuring rush hours, it is possible (but illegal) to be quickly dropped on the ring road. This is useful if your ride is not willing to get out of it to drop you (which is often the case). Within the ring area, you are definitely linked to the whole regular fare subway system.\\n\\nIf you are coming from the Northeast and your ride is heading South (which is a normal truck route), chances are that your driver will not drop you on the ring road where it is complicated to stop. A frequent place to get dropped is the first exit South on the A6 called \"Rungis\". From there, you can reach the Metropolitan subway system by tram with one ticket, then use another one to your final destination. You can also reach other suburbs in the 94 department (Val de Marne) taking the TvM bus, which is also a normal Paris ticket.\\n\\n== Getting around ==\\n\\nIf you need to use the Metro and don\\'t want to pay for an ever more exorbitantly priced ticket (€2.50 now!): [https://paris-luttes.info/IMG/pdf/bahalorspageparpage-2.pdf here] is a detailed guide on blackriding. It\\'s in French but here are some main takeaways:\\n* An easy way to get in is to stand in front of an exit gate and reach your arm to the sensor on the other side to trigger its opening (as illustrated in the guide)\\n* Otherwise, the main types of entrance gates are:\\n# Turnstile with a half-gate behind it: wait for someone to pass so that the half-gate is open and is slowly closing, jump over the turnstile or sneak under it, go through the space left open (easier if you\\'re skinny)\\n# Short glass doors: literally just push them forward with a bit of force. Genius move by the RATP who are expanding this type to more and more stations.\\n# Tall glass doors: these are tricky. Find another type or use an exit gate.\\n* Be careful to avoid busy stations with 3 lines or more (Châtelet, République, Nation, the main train stations, etc) as ticket inspectors tend to concentrate there, but you can get always get a bad surprise. They congregate at corridor angles where they can\\'t be seen ahead of time, so keep an eye out for foot traffic that is slowing in front of you, or voices saying things like \"contrôle des titres de transport, s\\'il vous plaît\".\\n\\nThe same goes for RER trains, with two main differences: ticket inspectors tend to actually get on board of them, and you are supposed to use your ticket in order to go through the exit gates.\\n\\n== Hitching out ==\\n\\nThere are plenty of excellent spots for hitchhiking North (\\'\\'Aire La Courneuve\\'\\'), East ([[petrol station hitchhiking|petrol stations]] and \\'\\'[[péage|barrières de péage]]\\'\\') and also South (\\'\\'Aire de Lisses\\'\\'). It\\'s all about how much you are willing to pay in public transportation, and how daring you are.\\n\\n=== North/Northeast towards [[England]], [[Lille]] and [[Belgium]] {{afr|1}} ===\\n\\nThese are classified by cost in public transportation from Paris\\' centre.  There is a bonus pro-tip at the bottom involving Arras :)\\n\\n==== Option 1: Porte de la Chapelle ====\\n\\nThis option costs one local ticket. Porte de la Chapelle is where the A1 starts. Local drivers say they often see hitchhikers there. To get there, take the metro line 12 to Porte de la Chapelle, then walk to the roundabout. You can try getting a ride on the roundabout (there are traffic lights, which means that cars have to stop) or you can stand on the opposite side facing the roundabout where the motorway starts. Another good option is to start hitchhiking in the same street where the metro is. There are 2 petrol stations in that very street, just 50m deeper into the city. They aren\\'t overcrowded and, at the same time, quite a few cars going up north stop here to refill; nonetheless, at such places, much depends on your luck, and according to some hitchhikers, this place won\\'t make it to the top 10 best hitchhiking places in France. It is therefore recommended to hitchhike at the roundabout, where a quiet lane right by the traffic lights gives you a good opportunity to get onto the motorway (avoiding at the same time all the traffic that heads for Boulevard Peripherique).\\n\\nA good option to leave faster is to show at the roundabout a sign for the airport Charles de Gaulle. There is a petrol station (Aire La Courneuve - see Option 2) before the airport where the driver could let you out; don\\'t miss it! The station is not so big and many drivers just go to the airport but at least you can ask people, whereas it could be hard and long at Porte de la Chapelle.\\n\\n==== Option 2: Motorway services Aire La Courneuve ====\\n\\n[[File:Masaru.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Hitchhiker Masaru at \\'\\'Aire La Courneuve\\'\\']]\\n\\nThis option costs one local ticket or zones 1–3 ticket (eur 2.75as of 2018). The petrol station Aire de Service de La Courneuve is about 2\\xa0km along the A1, north of Paris. \\n\\nTake bus 150 from Porte de la Villette or bus 250 from Fort D\\'Aubervilliers (both are on metro line 7) to the stop Parc Des Sports. \\nThis bus stop is next to the A1 highway. Just walk to the right from the bus stop, without ever passing under the overpass. Then walk east parallel to the motorway through the parking lot of an apartment complex. There is a wall preventing access to the motorway, but if you continue walking a few hundred meters east and up a slight grassy hill, the wall ends. You can then follow a steep, thorny path full of nettles down towards the motorway and back west towards the petrol station. There is a fence right along the motorway, but near the petrol station it has been trampled down and you can step over it. (The hole in the fence is still here in february 2025.)\\n\\nYou may need to climb the fance \\n\\nFrom the petrol station, most drivers are only going to the airport or local communities. You should ask for a lift at least to the toll station (\\'\\'péage\\'\\') heading north. This is a 20-minute drive down the motorway (some kilometers after the airport) and everyone has to stop here.\\n\\nIn february 2025 there were indeed almost just local drivers, with many people going to Orly airport. There were few people going to Creil, which is a good options as there is another Aire/Motorway services on the way.\\n\\n==== Option 3: Charles de Gaulle ====\\n\\nCharles de Gaulle airport can be an option for hitching North-East, although waiting times might vary a lot.\\n\\nIt is easy to jump the metro at terminal 2 and there wasn\\'t anyone guarding it. Maybe the same is true for terminals 1 and 3 but I can\\'t vouch for it.\\n\\nFrom terminal 2 walk out of terminal and head straight to the main road. You should see signs for A1 Paris Lille. Keep following these signs until the road splits for A1 Lille. One road goes to the left, under a bridge and there are some traffic lights. The other goes to the right. Stand to the right of the right turn. Cars can stop on a dashed out area to your left or drive a little past you on the right. A couple of cars stopped straightaway and I was easily able to get a lift to the next service station which had lots of people driving north to Lille, Belgium and Holland. \\n\\n==== Option 4: Motorway services Aire de Vémars Est====\\n\\nFrom Nation bus station (also a metro stop) take bus 351 to Roissypole located at Charles De Gaulle Airport Terminal 3. It\\'s the last stop and payment isn\\'t required to enter the bus.You can BLACK RIDE on this bus both ways\\n\\nFrom the coach station there Gare Routière you can catch the 95.01 bus to Vémars. Ask inside at the ticket office/information desk for which parking number the bus will be at. The ticket costs €2. [BEWARE this bus does \\'\\'\\'not\\'\\'\\' run on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays / so if that is the case, then get off at Quebec because the A1 highway going to Lille cuts through Paris multiple times and at this petrol station there is a higher chance of finding Dutch cars stopping and giving you a ride to another petrol station on the main highway, which is super busy and easy to find rides going to anywhere from Calais to Antwerp to Lille]\\n\\nUpdate\\nAs at Saturday 1 July 2023\\nThe parking lot for the bus 95.01 is F1,and the bus does run on Saturdays also,according to the time table and confirmed by the driver \\n\\nYou can always try to go with the bus number 702 to Vémars centre from the airport (20 stops, 39 minutes). This will also work on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays. The parking lot for the bus 702 is B2.\\n\\nFrom the Vémars bus stop walk straight 400m on Rue Pierre Curie (D17) until it merges with Rue De la Mairie. Walk an additional 350 m until this merges with Rue Des Vignolles (D16)\\n\\nOn your left, the A1 will be clearly visible as will the Aire de Vémars Ouest petrol station. From here, it is another 1.25km to any given entrance.\\n\\n==== Option 5: Porte de Bagnolet (A3) ====\\nGoogle maps: [https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Porte+de+Bagnolet/@48.8649082,2.4086197,17z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x47e66e87e1c7d877:0x17c4d9a47ae58890!2sPorte+de+la+Chapelle!8m2!3d48.897279!4d2.359192!3m4!1s0x47e66d8329157e27:0x2a4ba9074d60ae9a!8m2!3d48.8645542!4d2.4095799]\\nGet a ticket for the station Porte de Bagnolet. This is pretty close to where the A3 starts, which leads to the A1, so a lot of traffic is heading this direction. The place might not be ideal, but it worked. There is a bus stop, where buses often stop so the traffic is slowed down, furthermore, there is a small gas stop, where you can approach drivers directly which cue up there from time to time. Position yourself at the traffic lights before the bus stop to show your sign indicating the direction you want to go to.\\n\\n\\n==== Bonus Tip: Arras Service Station====\\nHeading north on the A1, there is a fantastic AUTOGRILL Aire de Wancourt Est service station just outside Arras [https://goo.gl/maps/2suUznoe5C42], with people heading pretty much everywhere.  You can get rides to the UK (Chunnel), Lille, Belgium, Netherlands.  Many difference license plates (GB, F, B, NL, D, E) and lots of opportunities.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Metz]], [[Strasbourg]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Germany]] {{Afr|4}} ===\\n\\n==== Option 1. From within the city limits: Quai de Bercy ====\\n\\nCheap, as you will only need a metro ticket and pretty fast too.\\n\\nYou can also try to hitch directly from within Paris rather than taking the train for at least half an hour and then walking. \\n\\nTake the metro line 14 to Bercy and exit towards Boulevard de Bercy, take the Boulevard down to the bridge where it intersects with Quai de Bercy. Standing on Quai de Bercy it is advisable to have a sign indicating you want to get onto the A4. When cars stop, ask if they are going all the way to the toll station (péage), many drivers turn off the A4 before that but there are not really any convenient places to continue hitch-hiking from before the toll station.\\n\\nUpdate:\\n- currently line 14 is not working\\n- standing anywhere on the street following the direction of the arena (south east) is not really recommended, instead walk to the bridge Pont Charles de Gaulle: use a sign „A4“ and wait on the Quai de la Rapée just nearby the bridge, there is also space for cars to stop -> get a lift to the last petrol station before the toll station\\n-> A lot of cars from Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and France are stopping here (some going to or coming back from Disneyland ;))\\n\\n\\n\\n==== Option 2. Motorway junction slip-road ====\\n\\nThis one is close to Paris, faster and cheaper to get to, but still in the megapolis. Starting from there, you\\'re likely to end up either at the petrol station described below or at the péage. Not good at night.\\n\\nTake the RER Line A (Red) in the direction of Boissy St Legere until the station Nogent Sur Marne. Leave the station in direction of Rue Joinville and follow the sign to the A4. It is a 30 minute walk. There is a red light before the slip road (on-ramp). Lots of traffic, possibility to stop on the ramp for brave drivers.\\n\\nAsk if your driver can take you at least to the next petrol station Aire De Ferrières which is within the free motorway network. Gare de Péage de Coutevroult toll gate is a bit further.\\n\\n==== Option 3: Motorway service station Aire De Ferrières ====\\n\\nTake RER A to station Bussy-Saint-Georges. You can also get to this RER A station by taking bus 4 or 44 from metro station Gutenberg. Walk 2 km Avenue Marie Curie till Rue Pavée turn down until street crosses A4 highway and after this turn left rest stop is next to you. Right side from there is Decathlon Logistics France if you get lost\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'ATTENTION\\'\\'\\' \\nThe bridge leads into the forest and getting onto the motorway might be a bit difficult, the reason being that you have to squeeze yourself to be able to pass through the narrow space between the bridge and the fence.Moreover,you have to descend onto the motorway through an overgrown grass.An alternative is to take bus 46 \\xa0at Busy-Saint-Georges station in the direction of Gare de Val d\\'Europe,or same bus at Gare de Val d\\'Europe in the direction of Torcy(this is important because the bus is infrequent and might be useful to catch it at the other side if wait time is long).From Bussy-Saint-Georges you\\'ll ride 4 stops and from Gare de Val d\\'Europe, 5 stops,alight at Bout Pêcheret and walk back in the direction the bus came from if you took it from Bussy-Saint-Georges and vice-versa. Continue walking on the [[D10]] road to cross the motorway and turn right on the road leading directly to the service station.\\n\\n=== Getting South or Southwest {{Afr|6}}, {{Afr|10}}, or {{Afr|11}} ===\\n\\nThese spots are close enough to the city to be getting traffic in all southern directions.\\n\\n==== Option 1: Porte d\\'Orléans ====\\n\\nOnce the most famous hitchhiking spot in France, this spot isn\\'t bad nowadays, but it isn\\'t great either. The good thing is that drivers aren\\'t surprised to see people there, and that you don\\'t need to get out of Paris in faraway suburbs. \\n\\nPorte d\\'Orléans is the terminal subway station of line 4. There is an entry on the \\'\\'périphérique\\'\\' ring road where lots of people are later heading South. The best place is besides the \"Novotel\" building or (better) opposite it at the traffic lights. Be warned, traffic here is heavy and fast moving. If you have much baggage or more than one person I would not fancy your chances here.  Waiting at the petrol station or even the adjacent war memorial will not give you the best traffic.\\n\\nNote : I think that the place in front of the hotel is pretty bad. Very hard for the cars to stop there. It\\'s better to stand before, at the red lights. I stood near the gas station at the lights, you miss all the cars not coming from inside Paris, but it\\'s way easier for the cars to see you and to stop.\\n\\nMake sure to specify with a sign specifying that you go to Orléans or Chartres (if you are heading Southwest - A10 or A11), and that the driver will leave you at least at the péage de Saint Arnoult or before that at Limours-Janvry service station. Beware, just after the \"péage\", the motorway separates between A10 and A11. If you are heading directly South onto the A6, have a sign (you may try Lyon or Fontainebleau) and make sure to be left at Aire De Lisses rest stop, roughly 35 km further, a little bit after Evry (drivers to Evry are not enough for you).\\n\\n==== Option 2: Porte d\\'Italie ====\\n\\nSimilarly Porte d\\'Italie which is not far from Porte d\\'Orleans is a good place to hitch from. Additionally if you walk down the exit to the traffic lights, there is an overhead bypass which can keep you dry in the rain.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Lyon]], [[Marseille]], [[Barcelona]], [[Italy]] {{Afr|6}} ===\\n\\n==== Option 1: Motorway services Aire De Lisses ====\\n\\nThis option costs EUR 5.85 (but possible to have ride without ticket also), a zone 1–5 ticket and takes roughly 75 minutes. Aire de Lisses is the first service area on the A6, situated about 35 km South of Paris. It can save you time because you avoid all outbound traffic not really heading your direction, being located after all the motorway branch-offs.\\n\\nGet the RER D towards Melun via Corbeil. Be careful to get on the right train as there are 2 routes for RER D towards Melun. Tthe ID of the train you need was ZIP or ZOP (All trains on RER lines have a 4 letter ID depending on stations served). If it\\'s too confusing get whatever train that goes to Corbeil Essonne and from there, whatever train that goes to Melun. Get off at the station Gare de Villabé the second after Corbeil-Essonnes. \\n\\nOtherwise, you can take the RER D to Évry-Courcouronnes Centre, and from their Bus 415^ in direction of Villabé. Get off at stop Ikea the gas station will be a five minute walk away. There is a fence that it looks like you’ll have to climb from the road, but a goat trail to its immediate right leads to a section of the fence that has been removed and allows access to the rest stop.\\n\\n^NOTE: As of October 2024 there is construction at the Évry-Courcouronnes Centre Station, specifically the upper-floor bus bays from where the 415 will usually depart. There is no signage directing you to its correct bus bay (and asking an employee in broken French led first to //very// erroneous directions for [[User:Movethathoof|Movethathoof]]). It is supposed to depart from Bay G, to the far right against the concrete wall as seen when exiting the station and facing the surface bus loop. An alternative bus to take is the 4307, departing from the Bay D, which will leave you across the D26 from the IKEA.\\n\\nNote: There is no barrier at Villabé and so you can pay the standard central Paris fare to get into the metro network and then just ride out there.\\n\\n==== Option 2: Motorway services Aire de Nemours ====\\n\\nYou can take a train to Nemours Saint Pierre (transilien R from Gare de Lyon, a ticket costs about 10 euros) and walk 45min to the AUTOGRILL Aire de Nemours A6 service area / Shell fuel station. Then you\\'re already on a paying section (no local traffic), far out from Paris (80km), and can get a ride to Châlon, Mâcon or Lyon in a few minutes.\\n\\n\\n=== South-West to [[Orléans|Orleans]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Spain]] {{afr|10}} & West to [[Le Mans]], [[Nantes]], [[Rennes]], [[Bretagne|Brittany]] {{afr|11}} ===\\n\\nThe A10 and A11 motorways follow the route of the \\'\\'\\'A6\\'\\'\\' (see above) from Paris, and split from it near Antony/Rungis. Then, before the A10 and the A11 split up, there is the service station of Limours-Janvry near Briis-sous-Forges and a [[péage]] near St-Arnoult, 40 km Southwest of Paris. Whichever spot you choose, ask the driver to take you at least until the Limours-Janvry service station or the péage of St-Arnoult. From these places, you can find a driver who takes you on the A10 or the A11 depending on which way you want to go.\\n\\n==== Option 1: Pont de Sevres ====\\n\\n[[File:ParisOut.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Hitching after the bridge]]\\n\\nThis option costs the price of an underground ticket. It takes you to the beginning of the N118 road which connects to the A10-A11 in about 25 km.\\n\\nTake the subway 9 to Pont De Sevres, its end station. You start walking towards the bridge, where you can see the signs towards Nantes, Bordeaux, etc. The hitchhiking spot is just before the bridge, at the red lights. You can try with the cars coming from the direction of the metro station, and also with the cars which came along the river and are turning left to get to the bridge.\\n\\n==== Option 2: Motorway junction Massy Palaiseau ====\\n\\nThis option costs Eur 4.90, a ticket for zones 1-4. This option is useful to get out of the ring roads and get directly on the A10 after all the branch-offs.\\n\\nTake RER B to Massey-Palaiseau station. Walk down Avenue Carnot along the Massy-Palaiseau railway towards the \\'\\'autoroute\\'\\'. After a while there you will see a long stretch of a road with lots of space for cars. Keep going and you will reach a roundabout. If you keep following this road, you will reach the  motorway entrance underneath a bridge. Make sure to get a ride to the first \\'\\'barrière de péage\\'\\' (30+ km) at St-Arnoult or to the Limours-Janvry service station 5 km down the road.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Edit July 2022\\'\\'\\' this does not work! There is pretty much zero car traffic, at least when I was there. If you\\'re starting in Massy-Palaiseau you\\'re better off thumbing at [https://goo.gl/maps/bbD5WGkiKeFqSFzBA this roundabout]. I didn\\'t wait too long here and got a ride straight to Le Mans.\\n\\n==== Option 3: Motorway service station Limours-Janvry ====\\n\\nThe first service station on the motorway is called Limours-Janvry and it is situated 2kms northeast of the village Briis-sous-Forges. To get there you need to take RER B to Massy-Palaiseau. From there take bus 91.03 to Briis-sous-Forges. It runs about 3 times an hour on weekdays, once an hour on Saturdays, and there are no buses on Sundays. Then walk northeast along the small local road Route D\\'Invilliers.\\n\\nBriis-sous-Forges to the petrol station [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=D131&daddr=Aire+de+Service+de+Limours-Janvry&geocode=FT3X5QIdxnEgAA%3BFZke5gIdK7wgAA&hl=en&mra=ltm&dirflg=w&sll=48.64455,2.16575&sspn=0.115917,0.338173&ie=UTF8&ll=48.626839,2.135124&spn=0.028989,0.084543&t=h&z=14  map]\\n\\n\\n==== Option 4: Péage de Saint-Arnoult ====\\n\\nYou can take the RER C train to Dourdan. There are no controls on the exit, so if you are on the cheap, you need to pay only the basic metro ticket (some EUR 1.33) to get into the underground network in Paris. Once in Dourdan, cross the railroad track and turn left and then go straight on the D836 until you reach the péage after 4-5 kilometers. You should be able to hitch a car as there are many passing by and the French take easily on small routes if they see you walking. Get off just after the road crosses the autoroute, go left and in a short while, you will reach the péage. Look at the map beforehand! You have much higher chances here then anywhere else, there are lots of cars going through.\\n\\n=== West towards Rouen, Le Havre, Caen {{Afr|13}} ===\\n\\n==== Inside Paris ====\\n\\nQuai André Citroën, under the ring road overpass. A lot of traffic on Fridays and Saturdays as many inhabitants of the 15th and 7th arrondissements go to Normandy for the weekend. As a result, this spot is very effective on these days (20 to 30 min on average) but much worse at other times (expect to wait one and half hours).\\n\\nPorte d\\'Auteuil, at the last traffic light to the entrance of the A13, or even right under the \"no pedestrians\" sign on the shoulder to the motorway just after the light, where cars haven\\'t picked up much speed yet and can see you well. Ask drivers to take you (at least) to Morainvilliers petrol station in Poissy.\\n\\n==== In the suburbs ====\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\' Autoroute A13 Gare de Péage de Buchelay toll\\n\\nTake Transilien J suburban train from Saint-Lazare station. The fare is €8 but you may not be controlled. Get off in  (not Mantes Station). There\\'s a 30 minute walk to the toll gate. You can search Innovaparc bus stop place is next to there\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\' South Area Morainvilliers rest area\\n\\nTake Transilien J or RER A from Paris and get off at Poissy. Take bus 20 to bus stop Auberg. There\\'s one bus every hour on weekdays, fewer than that on Saturdays and it doesn\\'t run on Sundays.\\n\\n== Airports ==\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'[[Charles de Gaulle airport]]\\'\\'\\' / \\'\\'\\'[[Orly airport]]\\'\\'\\' / \\'\\'\\'[[Beauvais]]\\'\\'\\' airport\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n{{Cities France}}\\n{{Excellent}}\\n{{IsIn|France}}\\n\\n[[Category:Europe]]\\n[[Category:France]]\\n[[Category:E5]]\\n[[Category:E15]]\\n[[Category:E19]]\\n[[Category:E50]]\\n[[Category:E54]]\\n\\n[[de:Paris]]\\n[[es:Paris]]\\n[[fr:Paris]]\\n[[nl:Parijs]]',\n",

It is situated within a ring road called \\'\\'le périphérique\\'\\', or \\'\\'le périph\\'\\'. The actual city is relatively small, but is surrounded by endless suburbs, which are linked to the urban public transportation system at no extra cost, as since January 2025 the Metro and the RER (suburban trains, not to be confused with Transilien trains) have a unified fare system.\\n\\nNote that there is an \"outer ring road\" to the Paris suburb area, motorway A86 (or \\'\\'super-périphérique\\'\\') and another wider ring even further called \"la Francillienne\" which isn\\'t completed but still used to connect . If your ride is not going to Paris itself, you might want to clarify which ring they are going to take as it may affect the place where you\\'d want to be dropped. You may also find them useful if you need to bypass Paris, especially the Francilienne, as it has more gas stations and less complex interchanges.\\n\\nGood to know if you\\'re starting to stink up in the City of Lights: the Municipality provides [https://www.paris.fr/pages/les-bains-douches-municipaux-138 free shower facilities ] in 17 locations around Paris. Note they are BYOT (bring your own toiletry).\\n\\n[[File:888_signs.jpg|thumb|240px|right|A small collection of the \"Paris\" signs for the [[Project 888]] where over 150 hitchhikers gathered and camped in front of the Eiffel Tower.]]\\n\\n== Hitching in ==\\n\\nDuring rush hours, it is possible (but illegal) to be quickly dropped on the ring road. This is useful if your ride is not willing to get out of it to drop you (which is often the case). Within the ring area, you are definitely linked to the whole regular fare subway system.\\n\\nIf you are coming from the Northeast and your ride is heading South (which is a normal truck route), chances are that your driver will not drop you on the ring road where it is complicated to stop. A frequent place to get dropped is the first exit South on the A6 called \"Rungis\". From there, you can reach the Metropolitan subway system by tram with one ticket, then use another one to your final destination. You can also reach other suburbs in the 94 department (Val de Marne) taking the TvM bus, which is also a normal Paris ticket.\\n\\n== Getting around ==\\n\\nIf you need to use the Metro and don\\'t want to pay for an ever more exorbitantly priced ticket (€2.50 now!): [https://paris-luttes.info/IMG/pdf/bahalorspageparpage-2.pdf here] is a detailed guide on blackriding. It\\'s in French but here are some main takeaways:\\n* An easy way to get in is to stand in front of an exit gate and reach your arm to the sensor on the other side to trigger its opening (as illustrated in the guide)\\n* Otherwise, the main types of entrance gates are:\\n# Turnstile with a half-gate behind it: wait for someone to pass so that the half-gate is open and is slowly closing, jump over the turnstile or sneak under it, go through the space left open (easier if you\\'re skinny)\\n# Short glass doors: literally just push them forward with a bit of force. Genius move by the RATP who are expanding this type to more and more stations.\\n# Tall glass doors: these are tricky. Find another type or use an exit gate.\\n* Be careful to avoid busy stations with 3 lines or more (Châtelet, République, Nation, the main train stations, etc) as ticket inspectors tend to concentrate there, but you can get always get a bad surprise. They congregate at corridor angles where they can\\'t be seen ahead of time, so keep an eye out for foot traffic that is slowing in front of you, or voices saying things like \"contrôle des titres de transport, s\\'il vous plaît\".\\n\\nThe same goes for RER trains, with two main differences: ticket inspectors tend to actually get on board of them, and you are supposed to use your ticket in order to go through the exit gates.\\n\\n== Hitching out ==\\n\\nThere are plenty of excellent spots for hitchhiking North (\\'\\'Aire La Courneuve\\'\\'), East ([[petrol station hitchhiking|petrol stations]] and \\'\\'[[péage|barrières de péage]]\\'\\') and also South (\\'\\'Aire de Lisses\\'\\'). It\\'s all about how much you are willing to pay in public transportation, and how daring you are.\\n\\n=== North/Northeast towards [[England]], [[Lille]] and [[Belgium]] {{afr|1}} ===\\n\\nThese are classified by cost in public transportation from Paris\\' centre.  There is a bonus pro-tip at the bottom involving Arras :)\\n\\n==== Option 1: Porte de la Chapelle ====\\n\\nThis option costs one local ticket. Porte de la Chapelle is where the A1 starts. Local drivers say they often see hitchhikers there. To get there, take the metro line 12 to Porte de la Chapelle, then walk to the roundabout. You can try getting a ride on the roundabout (there are traffic lights, which means that cars have to stop) or you can stand on the opposite side facing the roundabout where the motorway starts. Another good option is to start hitchhiking in the same street where the metro is. There are 2 petrol stations in that very street, just 50m deeper into the city. They aren\\'t overcrowded and, at the same time, quite a few cars going up north stop here to refill; nonetheless, at such places, much depends on your luck, and according to some hitchhikers, this place won\\'t make it to the top 10 best hitchhiking places in France. It is therefore recommended to hitchhike at the roundabout, where a quiet lane right by the traffic lights gives you a good opportunity to get onto the motorway (avoiding at the same time all the traffic that heads for Boulevard Peripherique).\\n\\nA good option to leave faster is to show at the roundabout a sign for the airport Charles de Gaulle. There is a petrol station (Aire La Courneuve - see Option 2) before the airport where the driver could let you out; don\\'t miss it! The station is not so big and many drivers just go to the airport but at least you can ask people, whereas it could be hard and long at Porte de la Chapelle.\\n\\n==== Option 2: Motorway services Aire La Courneuve ====\\n\\n[[File:Masaru.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Hitchhiker Masaru at \\'\\'Aire La Courneuve\\'\\']]\\n\\nThis option costs one local ticket or zones 1–3 ticket (eur 2.75as of 2018). The petrol station Aire de Service de La Courneuve is about 2\\xa0km along the A1, north of Paris. \\n\\nTake bus 150 from Porte de la Villette or bus 250 from Fort D\\'Aubervilliers (both are on metro line 7) to the stop Parc Des Sports. \\nThis bus stop is next to the A1 highway. Just walk to the right from the bus stop, without ever passing under the overpass. Then walk east parallel to the motorway through the parking lot of an apartment complex. There is a wall preventing access to the motorway, but if you continue walking a few hundred meters east and up a slight grassy hill, the wall ends. You can then follow a steep, thorny path full of nettles down towards the motorway and back west towards the petrol station. There is a fence right along the motorway, but near the petrol station it has been trampled down and you can step over it. (The hole in the fence is still here in february 2025.)\\n\\nYou may need to climb the fance \\n\\nFrom the petrol station, most drivers are only going to the airport or local communities. You should ask for a lift at least to the toll station (\\'\\'péage\\'\\') heading north. This is a 20-minute drive down the motorway (some kilometers after the airport) and everyone has to stop here.\\n\\nIn february 2025 there were indeed almost just local drivers, with many people going to Orly airport. There were few people going to Creil, which is a good options as there is another Aire/Motorway services on the way.\\n\\n==== Option 3: Charles de Gaulle ====\\n\\nCharles de Gaulle airport can be an option for hitching North-East, although waiting times might vary a lot.\\n\\nIt is easy to jump the metro at terminal 2 and there wasn\\'t anyone guarding it. Maybe the same is true for terminals 1 and 3 but I can\\'t vouch for it.\\n\\nFrom terminal 2 walk out of terminal and head straight to the main road. You should see signs for A1 Paris Lille. Keep following these signs until the road splits for A1 Lille. One road goes to the left, under a bridge and there are some traffic lights. The other goes to the right. Stand to the right of the right turn. Cars can stop on a dashed out area to your left or drive a little past you on the right. A couple of cars stopped straightaway and I was easily able to get a lift to the next service station which had lots of people driving north to Lille, Belgium and Holland. \\n\\n==== Option 4: Motorway services Aire de Vémars Est====\\n\\nFrom Nation bus station (also a metro stop) take bus 351 to Roissypole located at Charles De Gaulle Airport Terminal 3. It\\'s the last stop and payment isn\\'t required to enter the bus.You can BLACK RIDE on this bus both ways\\n\\nFrom the coach station there Gare Routière you can catch the 95.01 bus to Vémars. Ask inside at the ticket office/information desk for which parking number the bus will be at. The ticket costs €2. [BEWARE this bus does \\'\\'\\'not\\'\\'\\' run on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays / so if that is the case, then get off at Quebec because the A1 highway going to Lille cuts through Paris multiple times and at this petrol station there is a higher chance of finding Dutch cars stopping and giving you a ride to another petrol station on the main highway, which is super busy and easy to find rides going to anywhere from Calais to Antwerp to Lille]\\n\\nUpdate\\nAs at Saturday 1 July 2023\\nThe parking lot for the bus 95.01 is F1,and the bus does run on Saturdays also,according to the time table and confirmed by the driver \\n\\nYou can always try to go with the bus number 702 to Vémars centre from the airport (20 stops, 39 minutes). This will also work on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays. The parking lot for the bus 702 is B2.\\n\\nFrom the Vémars bus stop walk straight 400m on Rue Pierre Curie (D17) until it merges with Rue De la Mairie. Walk an additional 350 m until this merges with Rue Des Vignolles (D16)\\n\\nOn your left, the A1 will be clearly visible as will the Aire de Vémars Ouest petrol station. From here, it is another 1.25km to any given entrance.\\n\\n==== Option 5: Porte de Bagnolet (A3) ====\\nGoogle maps: [https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Porte+de+Bagnolet/@48.8649082,2.4086197,17z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x47e66e87e1c7d877:0x17c4d9a47ae58890!2sPorte+de+la+Chapelle!8m2!3d48.897279!4d2.359192!3m4!1s0x47e66d8329157e27:0x2a4ba9074d60ae9a!8m2!3d48.8645542!4d2.4095799]\\nGet a ticket for the station Porte de Bagnolet. This is pretty close to where the A3 starts, which leads to the A1, so a lot of traffic is heading this direction. The place might not be ideal, but it worked. There is a bus stop, where buses often stop so the traffic is slowed down, furthermore, there is a small gas stop, where you can approach drivers directly which cue up there from time to time. Position yourself at the traffic lights before the bus stop to show your sign indicating the direction you want to go to.\\n\\n\\n==== Bonus Tip: Arras Service Station====\\nHeading north on the A1, there is a fantastic AUTOGRILL Aire de Wancourt Est service station just outside Arras [{{Coords|50.2619333|2.8593804}}], with people heading pretty much everywhere.  You can get rides to the UK (Chunnel), Lille, Belgium, Netherlands.  Many difference license plates (GB, F, B, NL, D, E) and lots of opportunities.\\n\\n=== East towards [[Metz]], [[Strasbourg]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Germany]] {{Afr|4}} ===\\n\\n==== Option 1. From within the city limits: Quai de Bercy ====\\n\\nCheap, as you will only need a metro ticket and pretty fast too.\\n\\nYou can also try to hitch directly from within Paris rather than taking the train for at least half an hour and then walking. \\n\\nTake the metro line 14 to Bercy and exit towards Boulevard de Bercy, take the Boulevard down to the bridge where it intersects with Quai de Bercy. Standing on Quai de Bercy it is advisable to have a sign indicating you want to get onto the A4. When cars stop, ask if they are going all the way to the toll station (péage), many drivers turn off the A4 before that but there are not really any convenient places to continue hitch-hiking from before the toll station.\\n\\nUpdate:\\n- currently line 14 is not working\\n- standing anywhere on the street following the direction of the arena (south east) is not really recommended, instead walk to the bridge Pont Charles de Gaulle: use a sign „A4“ and wait on the Quai de la Rapée just nearby the bridge, there is also space for cars to stop -> get a lift to the last petrol station before the toll station\\n-> A lot of cars from Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and France are stopping here (some going to or coming back from Disneyland ;))\\n\\n\\n\\n==== Option 2. Motorway junction slip-road ====\\n\\nThis one is close to Paris, faster and cheaper to get to, but still in the megapolis. Starting from there, you\\'re likely to end up either at the petrol station described below or at the péage. Not good at night.\\n\\nTake the RER Line A (Red) in the direction of Boissy St Legere until the station Nogent Sur Marne. Leave the station in direction of Rue Joinville and follow the sign to the A4. It is a 30 minute walk. There is a red light before the slip road (on-ramp). Lots of traffic, possibility to stop on the ramp for brave drivers.\\n\\nAsk if your driver can take you at least to the next petrol station Aire De Ferrières which is within the free motorway network. Gare de Péage de Coutevroult toll gate is a bit further.\\n\\n==== Option 3: Motorway service station Aire De Ferrières ====\\n\\nTake RER A to station Bussy-Saint-Georges. You can also get to this RER A station by taking bus 4 or 44 from metro station Gutenberg. Walk 2 km Avenue Marie Curie till Rue Pavée turn down until street crosses A4 highway and after this turn left rest stop is next to you. Right side from there is Decathlon Logistics France if you get lost\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'ATTENTION\\'\\'\\' \\nThe bridge leads into the forest and getting onto the motorway might be a bit difficult, the reason being that you have to squeeze yourself to be able to pass through the narrow space between the bridge and the fence.Moreover,you have to descend onto the motorway through an overgrown grass.An alternative is to take bus 46 \\xa0at Busy-Saint-Georges station in the direction of Gare de Val d\\'Europe,or same bus at Gare de Val d\\'Europe in the direction of Torcy(this is important because the bus is infrequent and might be useful to catch it at the other side if wait time is long).From Bussy-Saint-Georges you\\'ll ride 4 stops and from Gare de Val d\\'Europe, 5 stops,alight at Bout Pêcheret and walk back in the direction the bus came from if you took it from Bussy-Saint-Georges and vice-versa. Continue walking on the [[D10]] road to cross the motorway and turn right on the road leading directly to the service station.\\n\\n=== Getting South or Southwest {{Afr|6}}, {{Afr|10}}, or {{Afr|11}} ===\\n\\nThese spots are close enough to the city to be getting traffic in all southern directions.\\n\\n==== Option 1: Porte d\\'Orléans ====\\n\\nOnce the most famous hitchhiking spot in France, this spot isn\\'t bad nowadays, but it isn\\'t great either. The good thing is that drivers aren\\'t surprised to see people there, and that you don\\'t need to get out of Paris in faraway suburbs. \\n\\nPorte d\\'Orléans is the terminal subway station of line 4. There is an entry on the \\'\\'périphérique\\'\\' ring road where lots of people are later heading South. The best place is besides the \"Novotel\" building or (better) opposite it at the traffic lights. Be warned, traffic here is heavy and fast moving. If you have much baggage or more than one person I would not fancy your chances here.  Waiting at the petrol station or even the adjacent war memorial will not give you the best traffic.\\n\\nNote : I think that the place in front of the hotel is pretty bad. Very hard for the cars to stop there. It\\'s better to stand before, at the red lights. I stood near the gas station at the lights, you miss all the cars not coming from inside Paris, but it\\'s way easier for the cars to see you and to stop.\\n\\nMake sure to specify with a sign specifying that you go to Orléans or Chartres (if you are heading Southwest - A10 or A11), and that the driver will leave you at least at the péage de Saint Arnoult or before that at Limours-Janvry service station. Beware, just after the \"péage\", the motorway separates between A10 and A11. If you are heading directly South onto the A6, have a sign (you may try Lyon or Fontainebleau) and make sure to be left at Aire De Lisses rest stop, roughly 35 km further, a little bit after Evry (drivers to Evry are not enough for you).\\n\\n==== Option 2: Porte d\\'Italie ====\\n\\nSimilarly Porte d\\'Italie which is not far from Porte d\\'Orleans is a good place to hitch from. Additionally if you walk down the exit to the traffic lights, there is an overhead bypass which can keep you dry in the rain.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Lyon]], [[Marseille]], [[Barcelona]], [[Italy]] {{Afr|6}} ===\\n\\n==== Option 1: Motorway services Aire De Lisses ====\\n\\nThis option costs EUR 5.85 (but possible to have ride without ticket also), a zone 1–5 ticket and takes roughly 75 minutes. Aire de Lisses is the first service area on the A6, situated about 35 km South of Paris. It can save you time because you avoid all outbound traffic not really heading your direction, being located after all the motorway branch-offs.\\n\\nGet the RER D towards Melun via Corbeil. Be careful to get on the right train as there are 2 routes for RER D towards Melun. Tthe ID of the train you need was ZIP or ZOP (All trains on RER lines have a 4 letter ID depending on stations served). If it\\'s too confusing get whatever train that goes to Corbeil Essonne and from there, whatever train that goes to Melun. Get off at the station Gare de Villabé the second after Corbeil-Essonnes. \\n\\nOtherwise, you can take the RER D to Évry-Courcouronnes Centre, and from their Bus 415^ in direction of Villabé. Get off at stop Ikea the gas station will be a five minute walk away. There is a fence that it looks like you’ll have to climb from the road, but a goat trail to its immediate right leads to a section of the fence that has been removed and allows access to the rest stop.\\n\\n^NOTE: As of October 2024 there is construction at the Évry-Courcouronnes Centre Station, specifically the upper-floor bus bays from where the 415 will usually depart. There is no signage directing you to its correct bus bay (and asking an employee in broken French led first to //very// erroneous directions for [[User:Movethathoof|Movethathoof]]). It is supposed to depart from Bay G, to the far right against the concrete wall as seen when exiting the station and facing the surface bus loop. An alternative bus to take is the 4307, departing from the Bay D, which will leave you across the D26 from the IKEA.\\n\\nNote: There is no barrier at Villabé and so you can pay the standard central Paris fare to get into the metro network and then just ride out there.\\n\\n==== Option 2: Motorway services Aire de Nemours ====\\n\\nYou can take a train to Nemours Saint Pierre (transilien R from Gare de Lyon, a ticket costs about 10 euros) and walk 45min to the AUTOGRILL Aire de Nemours A6 service area / Shell fuel station. Then you\\'re already on a paying section (no local traffic), far out from Paris (80km), and can get a ride to Châlon, Mâcon or Lyon in a few minutes.\\n\\n\\n=== South-West to [[Orléans|Orleans]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Spain]] {{afr|10}} & West to [[Le Mans]], [[Nantes]], [[Rennes]], [[Bretagne|Brittany]] {{afr|11}} ===\\n\\nThe A10 and A11 motorways follow the route of the \\'\\'\\'A6\\'\\'\\' (see above) from Paris, and split from it near Antony/Rungis. Then, before the A10 and the A11 split up, there is the service station of Limours-Janvry near Briis-sous-Forges and a [[péage]] near St-Arnoult, 40 km Southwest of Paris. Whichever spot you choose, ask the driver to take you at least until the Limours-Janvry service station or the péage of St-Arnoult. From these places, you can find a driver who takes you on the A10 or the A11 depending on which way you want to go.\\n\\n==== Option 1: Pont de Sevres ====\\n\\n[[File:ParisOut.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Hitching after the bridge]]\\n\\nThis option costs the price of an underground ticket. It takes you to the beginning of the N118 road which connects to the A10-A11 in about 25 km.\\n\\nTake the subway 9 to Pont De Sevres, its end station. You start walking towards the bridge, where you can see the signs towards Nantes, Bordeaux, etc. The hitchhiking spot is just before the bridge, at the red lights. You can try with the cars coming from the direction of the metro station, and also with the cars which came along the river and are turning left to get to the bridge.\\n\\n==== Option 2: Motorway junction Massy Palaiseau ====\\n\\nThis option costs Eur 4.90, a ticket for zones 1-4. This option is useful to get out of the ring roads and get directly on the A10 after all the branch-offs.\\n\\nTake RER B to Massey-Palaiseau station. Walk down Avenue Carnot along the Massy-Palaiseau railway towards the \\'\\'autoroute\\'\\'. After a while there you will see a long stretch of a road with lots of space for cars. Keep going and you will reach a roundabout. If you keep following this road, you will reach the  motorway entrance underneath a bridge. Make sure to get a ride to the first \\'\\'barrière de péage\\'\\' (30+ km) at St-Arnoult or to the Limours-Janvry service station 5 km down the road.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Edit July 2022\\'\\'\\' this does not work! There is pretty much zero car traffic, at least when I was there. If you\\'re starting in Massy-Palaiseau you\\'re better off thumbing at [https://goo.gl/maps/bbD5WGkiKeFqSFzBA this roundabout]. I didn\\'t wait too long here and got a ride straight to Le Mans.\\n\\n==== Option 3: Motorway service station Limours-Janvry ====\\n\\nThe first service station on the motorway is called Limours-Janvry and it is situated 2kms northeast of the village Briis-sous-Forges. To get there you need to take RER B to Massy-Palaiseau. From there take bus 91.03 to Briis-sous-Forges. It runs about 3 times an hour on weekdays, once an hour on Saturdays, and there are no buses on Sundays. Then walk northeast along the small local road Route D\\'Invilliers.\\n\\nBriis-sous-Forges to the petrol station [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=D131&daddr=Aire+de+Service+de+Limours-Janvry&geocode=FT3X5QIdxnEgAA%3BFZke5gIdK7wgAA&hl=en&mra=ltm&dirflg=w&sll=48.64455,2.16575&sspn=0.115917,0.338173&ie=UTF8&ll=48.626839,2.135124&spn=0.028989,0.084543&t=h&z=14  map]\\n\\n\\n==== Option 4: Péage de Saint-Arnoult ====\\n\\nYou can take the RER C train to Dourdan. There are no controls on the exit, so if you are on the cheap, you need to pay only the basic metro ticket (some EUR 1.33) to get into the underground network in Paris. Once in Dourdan, cross the railroad track and turn left and then go straight on the D836 until you reach the péage after 4-5 kilometers. You should be able to hitch a car as there are many passing by and the French take easily on small routes if they see you walking. Get off just after the road crosses the autoroute, go left and in a short while, you will reach the péage. Look at the map beforehand! You have much higher chances here then anywhere else, there are lots of cars going through.\\n\\n=== West towards Rouen, Le Havre, Caen {{Afr|13}} ===\\n\\n==== Inside Paris ====\\n\\nQuai André Citroën, under the ring road overpass. A lot of traffic on Fridays and Saturdays as many inhabitants of the 15th and 7th arrondissements go to Normandy for the weekend. As a result, this spot is very effective on these days (20 to 30 min on average) but much worse at other times (expect to wait one and half hours).\\n\\nPorte d\\'Auteuil, at the last traffic light to the entrance of the A13, or even right under the \"no pedestrians\" sign on the shoulder to the motorway just after the light, where cars haven\\'t picked up much speed yet and can see you well. Ask drivers to take you (at least) to Morainvilliers petrol station in Poissy.\\n\\n==== In the suburbs ====\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\' Autoroute A13 Gare de Péage de Buchelay toll\\n\\nTake Transilien J suburban train from Saint-Lazare station. The fare is €8 but you may not be controlled. Get off in  (not Mantes Station). There\\'s a 30 minute walk to the toll gate. You can search Innovaparc bus stop place is next to there\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\' South Area Morainvilliers rest area\\n\\nTake Transilien J or RER A from Paris and get off at Poissy.

It's a great, chilled out alternative to the bustling cities of the east coast, with a great original music scene and some beautiful beaches. The travelers, gypsies and vagabond mecca of Perth is the small port city of [[Fremantle]], located about 30km from the CBD on the coast. (''CBD'' means Central business district, the Ozzie term for city center). Bear in mind that anywhere north of Perth is getting into desert country. Take plenty of water and know where you're going!\\n\\n# Residents\\n\\nThese hitchhikers are currently located in Perth, and may be willing to offer tips or accompany you on your first hitchhike:\\n\\n* https://hitchwiki.org/en/User:Balupton\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n\\nGetting out of Perth is easy. The people in WA are generally more relaxed, friendly and trusting than folks on the east coast, which makes it a great place to hitchhike. Whether it's a short trip around the South-West forests and beaches, a full blown stint across the Nullarbor to Adelaide or an escape north to Broome or Darwin for the winter, it is usually less than half an hour's wait until your first ride out of Perth. As with any city, the trick is to get as far out of town as you can using the local public transport (Perth has a train network that will take you to within cooee of all the good hitching spots). Once you're at the spot, it's usually just a hop, skip and a jump or the straight and narrow to your next destination. Check out Perth on the [http://maps.hitchwiki.org Hitchwiki Map] for some good spots.\\n\\n\\n=== To Southwest Region (Bunbury, Busselton, Margaret River, Pemberton) ===\\n\\nTo get down to the southwest along the coast, take the train from Perth to Mandurah (if leaving from Fremantle, catch the 99 bus to the Murdoch train station and go to Mandurah from there). Once in Mandurah, walk out of the station and catch the 594 bus south at B4 platform (you can use the same ticket you had on the train) to the Miami Bakehouse (just ask the driver). They have really good pies, and there is a great hitching spot only about 500m south on the highway, with a big pullout onto some gravel.\\n\\nNote: They recently opened the Perth-Bunbury highway extending from the freeway, which means there is less traffic heading through Mandurah, however I have hitched it since the opening, and still only waited 20 minutes for a ride!\\n\\n\\n=== South to Albany ===\\n\\nTake the train all the way to Armadale. From Armadale train station, walk about a kilometre up the hill to the Albany Hwy/Southwestern Hwy junction (also a good alternative to get south to Bunbury via Pinjarra/Harvey along the Southwestern Hwy if you wanted). Walk about 200m up the Albany Hwy until you get to the small pulloff before the hill. See [http://maps.hitchwiki.org map] for exact spot.\\n\\n\\n=== North ===\\n\\nThis will be a big hitch, no matter where you're headed. It can take 3-4 days to get to Broome in a car. Trucks will probably be a better option. Whether your first stop is Geraldton on the coast, or Meekatharra (I hope it isn't!) on the inland highway, it will be at least 5-6 hours, possibly more, before you arrive anywhere. Take plenty of supplies (food, water...etc) and be prepared to start out early, or not at all. \\n\\n'''Option 1'''\\n\\nTake the train all the way to Midland. Then catch either the 310 or 311 bus and ask the driver to drop you at the big truck stop. These buses only leave early in the morning (around 8am), so make sure to check on the [http://www.transperth.wa.gov.au Transperth Website] for the timetables and get there early so you don't miss them! Plenty of trucks and cars fuel up at this stop, and there's even a good spot to stand on the road (if there is two of you, one can be asking at the servo while the other is thumbing on the road). You'll need to find out if your ride is heading up the coast (Brand Hwy), or inland (Great Northern Hwy), as these are two very different routes. If you just want to get north quick (to [[Broome]] or [[Darwin]]), try to get rides in trucks heading up the Great Northern, as this will cut a few hundred kilometres off the trip, however if you want to take the scenic route up the coast (Monkey Mia, Coral Bay, Exmouth) make sure to get in with someone heading to Geraldton.\\n\\n'''Option 2'''\\n\\nIf you want to hitchhike along the coast, you can try to start at State Route 60. Take a train to Clarkson (the most northern stop of the Joondalup line) and change for bus 484 going to Alkimos and hop off at Ridgewood Bvd After Hester Av (7 stops, I believe). Walk back 200 m to the main road passing by a petrol station on your left, turn left and follow the main road for 1.5 km until you reach State Route 60. Turn right and after 100 m there should two fairly busy petrol stations. I (single male) didn't have any problems to get a lift to the pinnacles or Jurien Bay. To be explicit: [https://goo.gl/maps/VPhRgE8FZ172 map].\\n\\n\\n=== East toward [[Kalgoorlie]], [[Adelaide]], [[Sydney]] ===\\n\\n[[File:03052013432.jpg|thumb|350px|The hitching spot on Great Eastern Highway toward [[Adelaide]]]]\\n\\nAlso a big hitch, be sure to take plenty of water and supplies if you will be camping. In winter it does get cold at hitchhiking at night in the desert. (Even though you've never seen it be cold in Australia on the TV, it does happen. Don't tell anyone.) If you're heading for the east coast the quickest and comfiest option is with a truck if you can get one who isn't prohibited from giving lifts, one who maybe owns his own truck.  You can have good luck with this just by thumbing on the roadside, as well as talking to the driver at a servo (service station) or truck/rest stop (these can be quiet though).  Most trucks are carrying things to be delivered by Monday morning at their destination, so the busiest times for them leaving Perth are Wednesday, Thursday and Friday whereas you will see much fewer on a Saturday or Sunday.  Trucks will not go through Kalgoorlie, they cut across from Coolgardie to Norseman.\\n\\nIf you hitch a car they may ask if you're willing to share the driving, in which case be aware that driving on the left and through thousands of kilometers of empty road in the desert leads easily to that special kind of microsleep where one may crash in a second, so take it easy! \\n\\nGetting out of Perth, take the train to Midland station, at the end of the line. From here take bus 320 and ask the driver to put you down on Great Eastern Hwy Before Park Rd A. There is a small paved rest stop area before the bus stop, where cars and even trucks can pull over easily, and good visibility of the road for some distance. Here you're out of the city already and should easily get a lift at least a few km along the road to the towns of Sawyer's Valley and Baker's Hill, which are good places to catch a longer ride as the road slows there for the townships.  Further along is Northam, which the main highway bypasses (don't take a lift into the town, but rather stay on the bypass which is the highway).  There is an ok spot to stand at the second turnoff to Northam, but it is just by the highway and people tend to be driving by fast. A lot of the traffic to (Kal)goorlie is worker dudes returning to work after a splash in the big smoke, easy rides, most traffic going long distance will be <12am.\\n\\nThe bus only goes once an hour from Midland, mostly at the half-hour but you may want to check in advance to avoid a long wait. You'll be getting off in Zone 3, so plan your bus/train ticket accordingly. Midland train station is also a famously bad area of Perth, so take care of your stuff and yourself, and don't be there at night if you can help it. But you'll be fine in the daytime and there are usually police around somewhere. Just be aware also that if you look too scruffy, drivers may hesitiate to pick you up on account of this.\\n\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n{{IsIn|Australia}}\\n[[Category:Australia]]\\n[[Category:E15]]\",\n",

It's a great, chilled out alternative to the bustling cities of the east coast, with a great original music scene and some beautiful beaches. The travelers, gypsies and vagabond mecca of Perth is the small port city of [[Fremantle]], located about 30km from the CBD on the coast. (''CBD'' means Central business district, the Ozzie term for city center). Bear in mind that anywhere north of Perth is getting into desert country. Take plenty of water and know where you're going!\\n\\n# Residents\\n\\nThese hitchhikers are currently located in Perth, and may be willing to offer tips or accompany you on your first hitchhike:\\n\\n* https://hitchwiki.org/en/User:Balupton\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n\\nGetting out of Perth is easy. The people in WA are generally more relaxed, friendly and trusting than folks on the east coast, which makes it a great place to hitchhike. Whether it's a short trip around the South-West forests and beaches, a full blown stint across the Nullarbor to Adelaide or an escape north to Broome or Darwin for the winter, it is usually less than half an hour's wait until your first ride out of Perth. As with any city, the trick is to get as far out of town as you can using the local public transport (Perth has a train network that will take you to within cooee of all the good hitching spots). Once you're at the spot, it's usually just a hop, skip and a jump or the straight and narrow to your next destination. Check out Perth on the [http://maps.hitchwiki.org Hitchwiki Map] for some good spots.\\n\\n\\n=== To Southwest Region (Bunbury, Busselton, Margaret River, Pemberton) ===\\n\\nTo get down to the southwest along the coast, take the train from Perth to Mandurah (if leaving from Fremantle, catch the 99 bus to the Murdoch train station and go to Mandurah from there). Once in Mandurah, walk out of the station and catch the 594 bus south at B4 platform (you can use the same ticket you had on the train) to the Miami Bakehouse (just ask the driver). They have really good pies, and there is a great hitching spot only about 500m south on the highway, with a big pullout onto some gravel.\\n\\nNote: They recently opened the Perth-Bunbury highway extending from the freeway, which means there is less traffic heading through Mandurah, however I have hitched it since the opening, and still only waited 20 minutes for a ride!\\n\\n\\n=== South to Albany ===\\n\\nTake the train all the way to Armadale. From Armadale train station, walk about a kilometre up the hill to the Albany Hwy/Southwestern Hwy junction (also a good alternative to get south to Bunbury via Pinjarra/Harvey along the Southwestern Hwy if you wanted). Walk about 200m up the Albany Hwy until you get to the small pulloff before the hill. See [http://maps.hitchwiki.org map] for exact spot.\\n\\n\\n=== North ===\\n\\nThis will be a big hitch, no matter where you're headed. It can take 3-4 days to get to Broome in a car. Trucks will probably be a better option. Whether your first stop is Geraldton on the coast, or Meekatharra (I hope it isn't!) on the inland highway, it will be at least 5-6 hours, possibly more, before you arrive anywhere. Take plenty of supplies (food, water...etc) and be prepared to start out early, or not at all. \\n\\n'''Option 1'''\\n\\nTake the train all the way to Midland. Then catch either the 310 or 311 bus and ask the driver to drop you at the big truck stop. These buses only leave early in the morning (around 8am), so make sure to check on the [http://www.transperth.wa.gov.au Transperth Website] for the timetables and get there early so you don't miss them! Plenty of trucks and cars fuel up at this stop, and there's even a good spot to stand on the road (if there is two of you, one can be asking at the servo while the other is thumbing on the road). You'll need to find out if your ride is heading up the coast (Brand Hwy), or inland (Great Northern Hwy), as these are two very different routes. If you just want to get north quick (to [[Broome]] or [[Darwin]]), try to get rides in trucks heading up the Great Northern, as this will cut a few hundred kilometres off the trip, however if you want to take the scenic route up the coast (Monkey Mia, Coral Bay, Exmouth) make sure to get in with someone heading to Geraldton.\\n\\n'''Option 2'''\\n\\nIf you want to hitchhike along the coast, you can try to start at State Route 60. Take a train to Clarkson (the most northern stop of the Joondalup line) and change for bus 484 going to Alkimos and hop off at Ridgewood Bvd After Hester Av (7 stops, I believe). Walk back 200 m to the main road passing by a petrol station on your left, turn left and follow the main road for 1.5 km until you reach State Route 60. Turn right and after 100 m there should two fairly busy petrol stations. I (single male) didn't have any problems to get a lift to the pinnacles or Jurien Bay. To be explicit: ''map'' {{Coords|-31.6773663|115.7193686|1}}.\\n\\n\\n=== East toward [[Kalgoorlie]], [[Adelaide]], [[Sydney]] ===\\n\\n[[File:03052013432.jpg|thumb|350px|The hitching spot on Great Eastern Highway toward [[Adelaide]]]]\\n\\nAlso a big hitch, be sure to take plenty of water and supplies if you will be camping. In winter it does get cold at hitchhiking at night in the desert. (Even though you've never seen it be cold in Australia on the TV, it does happen. Don't tell anyone.) If you're heading for the east coast the quickest and comfiest option is with a truck if you can get one who isn't prohibited from giving lifts, one who maybe owns his own truck.  You can have good luck with this just by thumbing on the roadside, as well as talking to the driver at a servo (service station) or truck/rest stop (these can be quiet though).  Most trucks are carrying things to be delivered by Monday morning at their destination, so the busiest times for them leaving Perth are Wednesday, Thursday and Friday whereas you will see much fewer on a Saturday or Sunday.  Trucks will not go through Kalgoorlie, they cut across from Coolgardie to Norseman.\\n\\nIf you hitch a car they may ask if you're willing to share the driving, in which case be aware that driving on the left and through thousands of kilometers of empty road in the desert leads easily to that special kind of microsleep where one may crash in a second, so take it easy! \\n\\nGetting out of Perth, take the train to Midland station, at the end of the line. From here take bus 320 and ask the driver to put you down on Great Eastern Hwy Before Park Rd A. There is a small paved rest stop area before the bus stop, where cars and even trucks can pull over easily, and good visibility of the road for some distance.

One spot in Gaia is a roundabout, next to the last metro stop (\\'\\'Santo Ovídio\\'\\'). This is an okay spot to stand, even at night, for going to both towards the north Porto and above as well as going south (but it is definitely easier to get a ride to the north there). It is better if you stare down the highway which points towards A1 Highway going to Lisbon and turning right to Porto and North, there is a small red light and stand there if you want to head back to Porto and North.\\n\\n==== From Repsol, Vila Nova de Gaia ====\\n\\n[[File:Porto_south_repsol_back_entrance.jpeg|200px|thumb|right|The entrance to the fenced tunnel to the back entrance of the gas station]]   There is a petrol station on the A1 highway just after the ramp which is excellent for rides to the south. Get to the last stop of the metro line D called Santo Ovídio. Walk south down Rua de Soares dos Reis (N1) and continue walking when it becomes the Rue Fonte dos Arrependidos. Pass under the highway through the tunnel and keep walking on the Rua Alto das Terras. After a few hundred meters you will see the petrol station on your left. Should take ~15 minutes, mostly downhill and in the shade. Walk the dirt road full of garbage to the left till you find fenced tunnel (pictured) that leads to door to the station with a doorbell you can ring so the staff will come and let you in. They\\'re fine with coming to open it.\\nAs of May 2019 the doorbell is broken, but if you happen to have a mobile phone with you, you can call them at +351 22 712 6842 and they will open the door for you (it\\'s really work!). In case you don\\'t have a working sim card, you can probably shout to attract attention and have them come over. Failing that, it\\'s also easy to get to the petrol station for someone that is ok with a \"short moment of illegality\": after the tunnel you can climb to your left side and then walk along the highway for some meters to the petrol station. Otherwise it\\'s also possible to climb over the gas station fence. A special tip, after the tunnel keep looking on your left side, you can find a lot of wild strawberries (in Summer, of course).\\n\\nYou can either stand in the petrol station or at the exit ramp. You can also try to stand in the highway itself, but as a passing policeman said, it is unlikely cars in the highway stop.\\n\\nThe following service station on the A1 is called Antuã-Estarreja. Anyone who is going in the direction of [[Aveiro]] but not to Lisbon can drop you off here, where there will be plenty off cars almost all bound straight for Lisbon.\\n\\n=== The route to [[France]] ===\\n\\nFor people trying to go from Porto and enter France as fast as possible. Go to the second Gas station, get lift in the direction of Viseu and then get dropped at any petrol station and then look out for cars and Portugese trucks which are going to France or cars that are from Belgium or Netherlands. Be patient and ensure you do not get down anywhere else but only \\'\\'\\'petrol stations\\'\\'\\'; don\\'t go with drivers to their city center or you will get stuck. Near border of Spain before the border if you are at a gas station, wait until you find a car or truck that goes all the way to Saint Sebastian, a Spanish town on the French border. You will have to be patient and you will definitely find with a little time and patience. Try to get a direct ride to France ( so that you can \\'\\'\\'skip Spain\\'\\'\\') which is a disaster for long distance hitchhiking.\\n\\nStart from the petrol station near \"Vila nova de Gaia\".\\n\\n=== North towards [[Braga]] and [[Spain]] ([[Vigo]], [[Santiago de Compostela]]) ===\\n\\n==== Option 1 ====\\n\\nTake the Tram/Train to São Frutuoso\\u200e (less than 2 Euro). Walk the \\'\\'Rua Prof. Antonio Marques\\'\\' until the end and you\\'ll arrive at a petrol station right next to the motorway to Vigo/Spain after appx 800m.\\n\\'\\'Note:\\'\\' There is a fence around the whole petrol station, almost impossible to climb. To ring the bell and ask for entrance is a bad idea. Walk along the fence until the bridge where it\\'s easy to climb over (January 2012). Try to be unwatched climbing the fence, the petrol station is privatized. I got kicked out in January 2012...In February 2012 I got dropped off on the other side direction Lisbon and had no problem at all staying at the petrol station.

The best way to get to the bus-station for the free shuttle-bus is to take the metro to \"Senhora da Hora\" (one stop before \"Estadio do mar\"), walk back (if you took the metro from the city) on the street along the metro-line, take a right into the street called \"Avenida de António Domingues dos Santos / Rua da Barranha\" and find a bus-station on the right side.

It\\'s located quite far from the center, but in a very nice area near the ocean. Park is huge and there are a lot of good places with bushes and trees for a tent. In the center of this park there is a large public WC which has free hot showers. It is a large round concrete building with ivy growing all around it, you can\\'t miss it! Only open during the day. There is good transport connection with the city center, or just follow Avenida da Boavista, it takes 60-80 minutes on foot from the center..\\n\\nPorto center streets can be a bit scary at night, if you need to sleep well and safe the airport is your best option. It is warm and safe and you can blackride the metro from the center to there in about 30 minutes and return the next morning to the city.\\n\\nCamping\\nThere is a lot of campings near \"Praia de Madalena\". It is close to the city centre, you just have to take the bus number 906. A place costs 6 euro per night.\\n\\n=== Eat ===\\nOn the Rua Doutor Alves da Veiga/Rua de Fernandes Tomas every weekday charity organisations feed people, start at 21:00.

One spot in Gaia is a roundabout, next to the last metro stop (\\'\\'Santo Ovídio\\'\\'). This is an okay spot to stand, even at night, for going to both towards the north Porto and above as well as going south (but it is definitely easier to get a ride to the north there). It is better if you stare down the highway which points towards A1 Highway going to Lisbon and turning right to Porto and North, there is a small red light and stand there if you want to head back to Porto and North.\\n\\n==== From Repsol, Vila Nova de Gaia ====\\n\\n[[File:Porto_south_repsol_back_entrance.jpeg|200px|thumb|right|The entrance to the fenced tunnel to the back entrance of the gas station]]   There is a petrol station on the A1 highway just after the ramp which is excellent for rides to the south. Get to the last stop of the metro line D called Santo Ovídio. Walk south down Rua de Soares dos Reis (N1) and continue walking when it becomes the Rue Fonte dos Arrependidos. Pass under the highway through the tunnel and keep walking on the Rua Alto das Terras. After a few hundred meters you will see the petrol station on your left. Should take ~15 minutes, mostly downhill and in the shade. Walk the dirt road full of garbage to the left till you find fenced tunnel (pictured) that leads to door to the station with a doorbell you can ring so the staff will come and let you in. They\\'re fine with coming to open it.\\nAs of May 2019 the doorbell is broken, but if you happen to have a mobile phone with you, you can call them at +351 22 712 6842 and they will open the door for you (it\\'s really work!). In case you don\\'t have a working sim card, you can probably shout to attract attention and have them come over. Failing that, it\\'s also easy to get to the petrol station for someone that is ok with a \"short moment of illegality\": after the tunnel you can climb to your left side and then walk along the highway for some meters to the petrol station. Otherwise it\\'s also possible to climb over the gas station fence. A special tip, after the tunnel keep looking on your left side, you can find a lot of wild strawberries (in Summer, of course).\\n\\nYou can either stand in the petrol station or at the exit ramp. You can also try to stand in the highway itself, but as a passing policeman said, it is unlikely cars in the highway stop.\\n\\nThe following service station on the A1 is called Antuã-Estarreja. Anyone who is going in the direction of [[Aveiro]] but not to Lisbon can drop you off here, where there will be plenty off cars almost all bound straight for Lisbon.\\n\\n=== The route to [[France]] ===\\n\\nFor people trying to go from Porto and enter France as fast as possible. Go to the second Gas station, get lift in the direction of Viseu and then get dropped at any petrol station and then look out for cars and Portugese trucks which are going to France or cars that are from Belgium or Netherlands. Be patient and ensure you do not get down anywhere else but only \\'\\'\\'petrol stations\\'\\'\\'; don\\'t go with drivers to their city center or you will get stuck. Near border of Spain before the border if you are at a gas station, wait until you find a car or truck that goes all the way to Saint Sebastian, a Spanish town on the French border. You will have to be patient and you will definitely find with a little time and patience. Try to get a direct ride to France ( so that you can \\'\\'\\'skip Spain\\'\\'\\') which is a disaster for long distance hitchhiking.\\n\\nStart from the petrol station near \"Vila nova de Gaia\".\\n\\n=== North towards [[Braga]] and [[Spain]] ([[Vigo]], [[Santiago de Compostela]]) ===\\n\\n==== Option 1 ====\\n\\nTake the Tram/Train to São Frutuoso\\u200e (less than 2 Euro). Walk the \\'\\'Rua Prof. Antonio Marques\\'\\' until the end and you\\'ll arrive at a petrol station right next to the motorway to Vigo/Spain after appx 800m.\\n\\'\\'Note:\\'\\' There is a fence around the whole petrol station, almost impossible to climb. To ring the bell and ask for entrance is a bad idea. Walk along the fence until the bridge where it\\'s easy to climb over (January 2012). Try to be unwatched climbing the fence, the petrol station is privatized. I got kicked out in January 2012...In February 2012 I got dropped off on the other side direction Lisbon and had no problem at all staying at the petrol station. Just make sure they don\\'t see you enter the petrol station \"illegally\".--[[User:Wukk|Wukk]] 18:14, 28 February 2012 (CET)\\n\\n==== Option 2 ====\\n\\nYou may hitch from the petrol station close to metro station \"Estadio do mar\".

There is a fence on the back but if you look trough some bushes where a little building is, the fence is broken and easy to climb, or there is an hole in the bottom (to be updated if they fix it). Go to Anagnina station either by metro or by bus (it\\'s one of the biggest terminal in Rome)  take the bus 046 and stop at \"carnevale lettere\", the gas station is only 400 m away. Walk back for a few meters  cross the road and turn right on via cavaglieri, and then the first left, and at the end of the street there is the gas station. there are also other buses going around the area (500, 504...) just use the route planner of public transport to see what\\'s the best for you\\nhttp://www.atac.roma.it/index.asp?lingua=ENG\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nTake Line No. 105 (Staz. ne Grotte Celoni) to the stop \\'\\'\\'Casilina/Tor Vergata\\'\\' (29 stops), walk 150 meters, go to stop \\'\\'Tor Vergata/Casilina\\'\\', take Line No. 507 (Anagnina (Ma)) to \\'\\'Heidelberg\\'\\' (4 stops) take Line No. 509 (Fosso del Cavaliere/CNR) to \\'\\'Fosso del Cavaliere/CNR\\'\\' (2 stops).

GPS coordinates are: [https://www.google.com/maps?q=41.900767,12.549775 41.900767, 12.549775] While the gas station described above has got traffic heading other directions already filtered out, this one serves people going multiple directions, but is way closer to the city center, easier to reach and still very effective. From Roma Termini, ride subway line B towards Rebibbia, and get off at Monti Tiburtini. From there, walk down the main road until you\\'re just past the second overpass (exact coordinates here: 41.902511, 12.556836). From there, walk up the off-ramp trying to keep behind the guardrail. At some point you\\'ll have to walk on the very road because of a fence surrounding a canal, but you can climb back over the guardrail after that. At the end of the off-ramp, you\\'ll have to walk on the motorway again, but it\\'s just a very short distance, and a part of it is ever sheltered by a concrete divider. The gas station is just a few meters down the road.

Its is right at the entrance of some kind of motorway (wich is not yet the highhay, the pay toll (\"pedaggio\") entering on highway A1 is still about 6 km away). You can walk along this two-lanes motorway and find a petrol station a few hundreds meters further up. There, ask for a ride to the highway. People could also be heading to [[Rieti]] (\\'\\'check this name\\'\\'), ask them if they can let you at the pay toll (\"casello\"), where there is a petrol station right before.\\n\\n==== Option 2 ====\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'A)\\'\\'\\' [https://www.google.com/maps/place/Eni+Salaria+Est/@42.0045509,12.5272698,428m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x132f6196f9928ebb:0xb90f770693656e38!2sRome,+Metropolitan+City+of+Rome!3b1!8m2!3d41.9027835!4d12.4963655!3m4!1s0x132f660a0d488fbb:0x2dbde5837b566932!8m2!3d42.004548!4d12.5288935?hl=en This] is a petrol station on the motorway A1 towards Firenze. To get there, take the metro (costs 1.5 euro) to \"Tiburtina\", and from there a regional train to \"Settebagni\". It takes 20 minutes, leaves every 15 minutes on weekdays and costs 1 Euro. You can follow [https://goo.gl/maps/RSDE7BRwM4x this route] to the footbridge over the motorway which leads you to the petrol station - the road is called Via dell\\'Inviolatella Salaria. You shouldn\\'t walk more than about 20-25 minutes from the station. Until Firenze, there are around 5 more petrol stations to change cars, so it goes quite well. The last one is 5 km before Firenze. \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'B)\\'\\'\\' [http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.010805,12.51824&num=1&t=h&sll=42.00736,12.52286&sspn=0.016583,0.032015&ie=UTF8&ll=42.009525,12.521281&spn=0.009008,0.01929&z=16 This] is petrol station which should at least bring you on the highway A1. (But probably it\\'s worth looking for a totally other petrol station on A1 which is reachable by public transport; at the latter station a lot of people don\\'t head onto the motorway, a lot head home)\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3\\'\\'\\' to Grosseto\\n\\nTake bus to Maglianella/Riserva Di Torretta, and walk a little bit forward to the highway and turn left, walk 20meters, there is a bus stop\\xa0 «\\xa0Aurelia/Brava\\xa0», a big place for car to stop.\\n\\n\\n=== South towards [[Napoli]], [[Sicily]] ===\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nThis is the first gas station on the highway connecting Rome to the A1 highway going south. It\\'s still inside the city, so very easy to reach, but it\\'s already on the highway. There is a fence on the back but if you look trough some bushes where a little building is, the fence is broken and easy to climb, or there is an hole in the bottom (to be updated if they fix it). Go to Anagnina station either by metro or by bus (it\\'s one of the biggest terminal in Rome)  take the bus 046 and stop at \"carnevale lettere\", the gas station is only 400 m away. Walk back for a few meters  cross the road and turn right on via cavaglieri, and then the first left, and at the end of the street there is the gas station. there are also other buses going around the area (500, 504...) just use the route planner of public transport to see what\\'s the best for you\\nhttp://www.atac.roma.it/index.asp?lingua=ENG\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nTake Line No. 105 (Staz. ne Grotte Celoni) to the stop \\'\\'\\'Casilina/Tor Vergata\\'\\' (29 stops), walk 150 meters, go to stop \\'\\'Tor Vergata/Casilina\\'\\', take Line No. 507 (Anagnina (Ma)) to \\'\\'Heidelberg\\'\\' (4 stops) take Line No. 509 (Fosso del Cavaliere/CNR) to \\'\\'Fosso del Cavaliere/CNR\\'\\' (2 stops).  Follow the sign Napoli to your right and then at keep left at the tournabout. Bus stops are a good indication that you\\'re on the right path. \\'\\'Via del Fosso del Cavaliere\\'\\' takes you to the other side of the motorway, and from there keep walking towards the IP Frascati Ovest gas station; you can enter it from the backside. Don\\'t bother about \"forbidden entrance\". And now you can continue hitchhiking towards Napoli/Sicily.\\n\\n\\n=== East towards [[Pescara]], [[L\\'Aquila]] ===\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nFrom Termini go by metro line B to Ponte Mammolo station, and there you can take bus 508 (that is first station) and go untill last station Mondavio. That is one long ride and you will come close to crossroad of second ring of highway around Rome and highway from Rome to east [Pescara, L Aquila]. Actually from that last station Mondavio, you have walking around 500m to highway and then choose left side walk to Roma Est Strada dei Parchi toll around 1 km or right side walk to Eni A24 Colle Tasso Sud gas station 1 km. We were walking on the highway which is illegal, but we had a luck not to be caught by police. \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nThere\\'s a much more practical option if you want to head east. It\\'s a Q8 Easy  gas station at the very beginning of A24 on the outbound side. GPS coordinates are: \\'\\'41.900767, 12.549775\\'\\' {{Coords|41.900767|12.549775|1}} While the gas station described above has got traffic heading other directions already filtered out, this one serves people going multiple directions, but is way closer to the city center, easier to reach and still very effective. From Roma Termini, ride subway line B towards Rebibbia, and get off at Monti Tiburtini. From there, walk down the main road until you\\'re just past the second overpass (exact coordinates here: 41.902511, 12.556836). From there, walk up the off-ramp trying to keep behind the guardrail. At some point you\\'ll have to walk on the very road because of a fence surrounding a canal, but you can climb back over the guardrail after that. At the end of the off-ramp, you\\'ll have to walk on the motorway again, but it\\'s just a very short distance, and a part of it is ever sheltered by a concrete divider. The gas station is just a few meters down the road. Place also is 5oo metres away from Roma Prenestina train stop\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n__NOTOC__\\n\\n{{IsIn|Italy}}\\n\\n\\n[[Category:Italy]]\\n[[Category:E35]]\\n[[Category:E80]]\\n\\n[[fr:Rome]]'},\n",

You are now at the road number 43 (E68) towards the [[Nădlac-Nagylak border crossing]] and the Romanian city of [[Arad (Romania)|Arad]]. \\nMost people here drive only to Mako (next town, in Hungary), but from there you can find another hitch to the border town or event to Romania. At the border it's easy to get a ride with a truck driver. \\nMost traffic to Romania goes via A1 highway, so maybe it's better to use that one.\\n\\n=== West towards [[Baja]], [[Pécs]] (55) ===\\nTake the tram number 3 or 3F until ''Fonógyári út'' station, stay on the road 55 (also called ''Bajai út''), walk, and cross the railway (arround 200 m) and afther you'll find places where cars can stop.\\n\\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\\n\\n[[nomad:Szeged]] [[trash:Szeged]]\\n\\n\\n\\n[[Category:Hungary]]\\n[[Category:E68]]\\n[[Category:E75]]\\n[[ru:Сегед]]\"},\n",

Toulouse\\'s bypass is complicated, so try to change vehicles at a [[péage]] when entering the motorway. If you change at the exit péage before entering the Toulouse bypass a lot of passing traffic won\\'t be going the same way as you.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n=== North towards [[Bordeaux]], [[Agen]], [[Limoges]], [[Paris]] {{E|9}} {{E|72}} {{Afr|62}} ===\\n\\nOption #1: to get directly to the toll (\\'\\'péage\\'\\') starting the highway A62. From the metro station \"La Vache\" (Metro line 2), take the bus 29/60/69/105, get off at \"Lapin\", walk ahead (on Avenue de Front) for about 75 meters and take the first left (Chemin du Lapin) until you reach a pedestrian bridge. From there you can jump across a small barrier, get in something that looks like a small abandoned field and walk along ahead for about 100 meters. You\\'ll see a one-way northbound motorway connection road to what will become the péage after about 500 meters. You want to walk along that portion, staying as much as possible on the right side of the safety barrier (not very dangerous actually, but if the police see you, they won\\'t stop to annoy you). In my opinion (Hertinek, aka Uncle_Franek), this is the ultimate option to hitch north out of Toulouse. I\\'ve lived in the area almost all my life, and have experienced many different spots. Today I always use this one. Two busstops after \"Lapin\" you can leave the bus at stop \"Lapparou\" as well, walk ahead 50 meters, turn left Impasse des Horticulteurs at the end of which you will find a red wall and fence which you need to climb over, which is probably possible as the fence is damaged - this way you are only a few meters from the péage, which then saves you from walking along the motorway for half a kilometer. Take a HUGE sign with you as the toll is large. \\n\\nOption #2 : a smaller peage but maybe easier to reach (I had to get there because there were policemen and higway employees at the main one), from the subway station La Vache, take the bus 69 toward Bruguières, then stop at Pont rouge, you\\'ll need to walk a few hundred meters, cross the bridge and you\\'ll be at Saint Jory\\'s peage, I got a ride to Agen waiting just a few minutes.\\n\\nOption #3: you can walk to the entrance of the \"périphérique\" (ring road) at Pont Jumeaux as well (10mns walk from metro Canal du Midi), there are 2 traffic lights there. Easy to go there (plus standing at the péage might be forbidden), nice spot, but took me like 1 hour to get a ride, both times.\\n\\nOption #4: REALLY EASY. A really good idea is to take the metro to Balma Gramont, from there, 5 min away there is a ramp entrance to the \"périphérique\", a lots of cars go in that direction, cars can easily see you and stop, you can find people going torwards Bordeaux(A62) Montauban/Paris(A20) or Albi (A68). I\\'ve hitchhiked several times there any day any time of year and sometimes I\\'ve not been alone, there are often other hitchhikers going out Notrh from Toulouse there (especially during the summer). The big advantage is that you\\'ll get there really easily, compared to the time it takes you to go to the péages, and if the person that stops isn\\'t going in your direction they can always leave you at a péage. So if you\\'re heading anywhere North of Toulouse you can think of starting at Balma.\\n\\n=== Northeast, towards [[Albi]] {{AutorouteFR|68}} ===\\nTake metro line B to stop Borderouge, then change bus 40 or 73 or walk to stop Atlanta. Just walk along the Route d\\'Albi to the road sign post before the road splits to ramp onto A62 and hitch with a sign. The passing traffic goes to Albi via D888 or A68.\\n\\n=== The [[Péage]] towards the East/South-East (Carcassonne, Narbonne, Perpignan, Montpellier) {{AutorouteFR|61}} ===\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nTake metro line B in the direction \\'\\'Ramonville\\'\\' to the very last stop.

Walk along the \\'\\'route nationale\\'\\' to your right until you arrive at a roundabout. Go left, over the bridge that crosses the motorway, you\\'re now on the right side, follow the motorway to the toll gate. If no cops are around and you feel lucky you can hitch from the inter-lane spaces (effective but illegal...) or otherwise go to the small service-area just behind (no petrol pumps but people do stop occasionally, and you can always wave a thumb at passing cars).\\n\\nOther Option: Take bus 58 from Basso-Cambo to \"Centre de détention\" (there are not many so check the schedules, but some terminates only at \"Seysse maison d\\'arrêt\" or \"Seysse Gay\", it also works but the walk will be longer). From there walk 10min to the entrance of the motorway https://goo.gl/maps/b9bkxUH2xqB2 . All the traffic that wants to avoid the toll (péage) will enter here as the motorway becomes free and there is a good place to stop for the cars. You can easily find a lift to the petrol station 20km down or further away.\\n\\nYou can also walk directly from the Metro station Basso Cambo or even better Bellefontaine to the highway entrance.

More than 1.6 million people live there. It is the largest city of Austria and is surrounded by the state of [[Lower Austria]]. It is also an administrative district (Bundesland) of its own.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n\\n=== From Vienna Airport all directions [[Bratislava]], [[Budapest]], [[Brno]], [[Linz]] or [[Graz]] ===\\n\\nVienna Airport is the largest one in the region and many people who are leaving or landing are being dropped or picked up there by their friends or family members. You can find rides in all of the directions by asking the drivers there according to their license plates. Departing travelers are often dropped at the Abflugstrasse above the ground floor of the terminals, arriving travelers are picked at the Kurzparkplatz in front of the arrival hall. Chance of getting such ride might be better at the Abflugstrasse as the driver going back has free place, but the with the arriving ones you will surely hear fresh travel stories.\\n\\n\\n=== West towards [[Linz]], [[Salzburg]], [[Munich]] {{Aat|1}} {{European Route Number|60}} ===\\n\\n==== Option 1: Petrol station Unter-St. Veit ====\\n\\nTake the U4 to \\'\\'Ober St. Veit\\'\\' and you\\'ll find a petrol station on the other side of the road. Just ask around and you\\'ll find a ride within minutes.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Personal experiences\\'\\'\\'\\n\\n\\'\\'Lots of German license plates coming through here. Was able to get a ride going all the way to Western Germany in around an hour of waiting. Worth holding out if you would like to get through Austria all in one chunk. - [[User:AloysiusDente|AloysiusDente]] (March 2024)\\'\\'\\n\\n==== Option 2: Hadikgasse Busstop, recommended option ====\\n\\nTake the U4 to \\'\\'Hütteldorf\\'\\', get off and go towards \\'\\'Hadikgasse\\'\\' (left), walk left again, then you are right on the main road leading out of \\'\\'\\'Vienna\\'\\'\\' towards the A1. There is a bus stop which is a well known hitching spot. Change cars (if necessary) at the [[rest area]]s \\'\\'[[Sankt Pölten|St. Pölten]]\\'\\' or \\'\\'Ansfelden\\'\\'. Since a direct ride to Salzburg is possible try to avoid \"part-rides\" and avoid going to St. Polten at all cost- the traffic there is very low and mostly local. From here you can as well get to option \"2\" by crossing the motorway via the bridge and walk for about 2km to the right.<br>\\n\\n==== Option 3: OMV petrol station on Wiener Straße (A1) ====\\n\\nTake train (S50) to \\'\\'Wien Wolf in der Au\\'\\'. Then cross over the bridge. You\\'ll see the petrol station after about 300m to your left. Cross the bridge and then it\\'s a short walk behind the barrier along the side of the road.  There is as a big resting area with service station.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Prague]] ===\\n\\nThe easiest way to get from Vienna to Prague is to go through [[Brno]]. \\n\\nThere is an option to go straight from Vienna to Prague. Take a train from \\'\\'Handelskai\\'\\' to \\'\\'Kornneuburg\\'\\'. Get out of the station and turn left. You\\'ll get to a street called Doktor-Max-Burckhard-Ring, it will take you to the main street (Stockerauer Straße) Follow the main street, and then turn left on any of the first two streets (Scherzgasse or Hofaustraße) Turn right, and you\\'ll get to the street that crosses the railways. Cross the railway and walk further until you see an on-ramp. There is also a petrol station to hitchhike from. However, most cars are only going to nearby towns from which it is not possible to hitchhike further. Again, try going through Brno instead.\\n\\n\\n=== North towards [[Brno]] ([[Czech Republic]]) {{European Route Number|461}} ===\\n\\n[[File:MrTweek.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[MrTweek]] hitching to [[Vienna]]]]\\n\\n====Option 1====\\n\\nFrom central Wien take tram 31 to the last stop, \\'\\'Stammersdorf\\'\\'. Continue on your right down the main street, Brünner Str (road no.&nbsp;7); go past the Billa Plus supermarket until you come to another shopping centre, about 300&nbsp;m further. Hitchhike right after the entrance to the parking lot. \\n\\nYou can use a sign \"Brno\", but if you don\\'t get a lift after 30 minutes, then just hitchhike without a sign and ask any driver to take you to Wolkersdorf or Mistelbach. There is a huge petrol station 5&nbsp;km north of Wolkersdorf and from there it is easy to find a lift into the Czech Republic.\\n\\n====Option 2====\\n\\nTake the [https://www.g3-shopping.at/services/bus-shuttle-s11150/ free bus to G3 Shopping Center] . The Bus starts from the regional buses\\' stop in front of the \"Floridsdorf Bahnhof\" train station, they depart in 30 minute intervals, more frequently during Fridays/Saturdays, first bus at 08:00am. If you do make the terrible mistake of taking the local bus instead of the free one, it will cost you 4.20 euro and you can\\'t black-ride, as it\\'s paid to the driver. From where the bus stops, cross the parking lot towards the big street that the bus had taken out of Vienna and cross that street. There is a petrol station \"Eni\" (the yellow one) and next to that there is a free, unused lane for cars and trucks to stop easily. [https://goo.gl/maps/a9pXqeusHft GoogleMaps Footpath]\\n\\n=== East towards [[Bratislava]], [[Győr]] and [[Budapest]] {{Aat|4}} {{European Route Number|60}} ===\\n\\nThere is an OMV [[petrol station hitchhiking|petrol station]] with a McD on the motorway to Budapest where you can easily find a ride to Bratislava, [[Hungary]] or further.\\n\\nTo get to this petrol station by public transport, take metro line U3 to \\'\\'Enkplatz\\'\\' and from there you can take a bus 76A to \\'\\'7.&nbsp;Haidequerstraße\\'\\' (the bus stop is on the other side of the street at the intersection when you leave the metro station). Be careful because there are two stops with almost the same name, \\'\\'7.&nbsp;Haidequerstraße\\'\\' and \\'\\'11.&nbsp;Haidequerstraße\\'\\' – get off at the first one, which comes after the stop \\'\\'Simmeringer Haide\\'\\'. After the stop, the bus turns right, but to get to the petrol station, walk straight on on to the north for just 200&nbsp;m. The petrol station is on the [[A4 (Austria)|A4]] highway towards Bratislava, Győr and Budapest. Once you have reached the petrol station, just wait near the entrance and ask drivers entering the shop.\\n\\nNote: Watch out for Romanian drivers who may attempt to charge you for the ride; make sure before you accept a lift from a Romanian driver that you are not going to pay by saying e.g. \\'\\'E gratis? / N-am bani sa va dau.\\'\\' ‘\\'\\'\"Is the lift free? / I can\\'t pay.’\\n\\nMost of the cars passing in this petrol station are coming off the motorway or going to the airport. You can get more cars going to [[Slovakia]] or [[Hungary]] if you take the first ride to the next petrol station on the motorway, named Göttlesbrunn, which is just before road splits into the E58 towards Bratislava and the E60 towards Budapest. The E60 road enters Hungary at the [[Hegyeshalom-Nickelsdorf border crossing]].\\n\\nIf your ultimate destination is [[Romania]], then ask your driver to leave you at the [[Hegyeshalom-Nickelsdorf border crossing]] and hitch from there with a sign Romania\\n\\n\\n=== South towards [[Graz]], [[Slovenia]], [[Zagreb]] {{Aat|2}}===\\n\\n===Option 1: Triesterstraße, highly recommended===\\n\\nWith the completion of the construction site the hitchspot at the [https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2043915283 onramp from Triesterstraße] is open again.\\n\\nThere is a lot of space to stop. On empty streets cars will go 70km/h but they are slower (<50km/h) when there is more traffic (during most of the day). There is also street light and a bridge in case of night or rain. There is even a small section of gras with trees where you can camp. Public transport: Badner Bahn from Wien Meidling, station Wien Inzersdorf, ~5 min walk. A regular Vienna City Ticket (2,40€ in 2020) is sufficient.\\n\\nThere are several places beforehand on Triesterstraße where people tried hitchhiking. Triesterstraße / Computerstraße, public transport: Bus 16a from U6 Am Schöpfwerk. Triesterstraße / Herta-Firnberg-Straße, you can only ask people - no thumbing, includes a McDonalds and a gas station, public transport: Bus 7B from train station Wien Meidling\\n\\n===Option 2: ===\\n\\nOther option if you want to pay EUR 3.40 for the train then take the \\'\\'Badener Bahn\\'\\' to \\'\\'Maria-Enzersdorf (Südstadt)\\'\\' Advantages of the latter one: it goes more often and earlier in the morning than the bus. If you take the train, you can go to one station after \\'\\'Shopping City Süd\\'\\' which is called \\'\\'Maria-Enzersdorf (Südstadt)\\'\\'. This one is closer to the actual [[slip road|interchange]]: just get off the train, head the direction you came from, turn right by the end of the platform, cross the tracks, pass 100 m of wild grass and there is a curved street – you\\'ll see the signs.\\n\\nAlternatively you can take public transport to \\'\\'Matzleinsdorfer Platz\\'\\' where the \\'\\'Triester Straße\\'\\' begins [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Triester+Stra%C3%9Fe+2,+Vienna,+%C3%96sterreich&aq=0&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=26.674078,56.513672&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Triester+Stra%C3%9Fe+2,+Favoriten+1100+Wien,+Austria&z=15] (direction South-West). This road is extremely long but it has on-ramps for heading South ([[Graz]]). Try hitching along this road, or ask at the petrol station. If you keep walking down there is a perfect place for hitchhiking where cars take the exit and join the highway. There is a lot of grass and a perfect place with enough room for even a truck to stop.\\n\\n===Option 3: Grünbergstraße / Altmannsdorfer Straße===\\n\\nIf you are OK with hitchhiking at traffic lights, you can also just go to \"Schönbrunn\" with U4 (underground – green line). Cross the street and walk towards the entrance of Schönbrunn-castle. Now you are on \"Grünbergstraße\". Here you can try to hitchhike from the traffic lights. This street leads to \"Altmannsdorfer Straße\" which leads to A2 (the motorway leading to the south)\\n\\nFor everyone going to Slovenia or Zagreb, know that there are no petrol station on your side of the road some 100 kilometres before Graz. The first one is near Leibnitz, some 15-20 km after Graz. So if someone offers you a ride to Graz, try to see if they\\'re maybe going to Leibnitz or past Leibnitz. There are many people from Maribor working in Graz, so if you end up in Graz, try using a sign for Maribor on roads going out of the city towards the highway. The petrol station near Leibnitz is on the way to Maribor.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking in ==\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'From [[Germany]]\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nMost of the traffic going through [[Passau]] is heading East to [[Linz]], [[Vienna]], [[Budapest]] while most of the traffic going through [[Salzburg]] is heading South to [[Trieste]], [[Italy]], [[Slovenia]], [[Balkans]].\\n\\nYou should then seriously consider coming by the E56 (even if you come from southern Germany).\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'From East, West\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nIf your driver heads to [[Slovakia]] ([[Bratislava]]), [[Hungary]] or the eastern [[Balkans]] they\\'ll pass the Airport at \"Schwechat\". There is public transportation, of course, but if you are in the departure area there are a lot of drivers emptying their cars before going back to the city.\\n\\nIf you find yourself in a car that is passing through Vienna on the eastern ring road, try getting out around the Donau island (German: \\'\\'Donauinsel\\'\\'), close to the river. From here you can walk to a metro-station that usually heads directly towards the centre of Vienna.\\n\\nYou will often find yourself, especially at night, on the E60 passing south of Vienna. I dont know if trucks can go there since you have to go through an underpass: Jump out at the exit \"Campus 21\"/\"Breitenfurterstrasse\" [https://goo.gl/maps/arqWXJGH2eD2 GoogleMaps]. Take care since it is an exit with 2 exits, you should keep as right as possible! About 100m further there is a roundabout where you can jump out and the car can get directly back to the highway. From that roundabout it is about 3km to the next U-Bahn, the final stop of U6. I found this to be the shortest way to get to public transport. If you come at night, there is a so called ASTAX, you call a number, and from the moment when there are enough people that want to go a small bus comes and picks you up, you pay by buying a regular ticket ([http://www.wienerlinien.at/media/download/2015/ASTAX_N64_141310.pdf Number, Schedule, ... in German]). The ASTAX will bring you to the night bus N64 that is driving through basically all Vienna ([http://www.netzplanwien.at/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Nachtnetz-Wien_20131215.pdf map in German for public nightlines in Vienna]).\\n\\n== Public transport ==\\n\\nIt is possible to ride the subway, bus, and tram system with no ticket, though at your own risk. Buses and trams are almost never controlled (except night buses and in the first month of each semester, e.g. October and March), but checks on the metro are rather frequent. Also they check trams around center.The fine is EUR 103, but foreigners can give a fake address in their home country and avoid paying.\\n\\nThe Wiener Linien themselves provide information on where their ticket inspectors are riding on any given day (https://www.wienerlinien.at/web/wiener-linien/kontrollen). It is unsure how reliable this information is, so be careful anyway.\\n\\nAnother website where the passengers tell of where and when they have seen controllers is http://schwarzkappler.info/, with information for major Austrian cities and some German cities as well, with Facebook and Twitter pages.\\n\\n== Sleeping == \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1: Erdberg\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nTake line U3 of the metro to the station \\'\\'Erdberg\\'\\'. Exit the station, then walk 300 m southeast to the pedestrian bridge over the railway tracks. This pedestrian bridge will bring you over the railway tracks, the Danube canal and the motorway. On the other side, behind a few houses, there is a vast park where you can pitch a tent. You can even sleep late, as in the mornings the only passers-by are joggers and riders on horseback.\\n\\n[[File:Vienna-erdberg-sleeping.png|200px|thumb|left|The walk from Vienna\\'s U3 metro station Erdberg to a park for camping.]]\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2: Park Prater\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nAlmost the same as Erdberg but a lot closer to the city centre, you can camp in the Prater Park / Jesuitenwiese.

More than 1.6 million people live there. It is the largest city of Austria and is surrounded by the state of [[Lower Austria]]. It is also an administrative district (Bundesland) of its own.\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n\\n=== From Vienna Airport all directions [[Bratislava]], [[Budapest]], [[Brno]], [[Linz]] or [[Graz]] ===\\n\\nVienna Airport is the largest one in the region and many people who are leaving or landing are being dropped or picked up there by their friends or family members. You can find rides in all of the directions by asking the drivers there according to their license plates. Departing travelers are often dropped at the Abflugstrasse above the ground floor of the terminals, arriving travelers are picked at the Kurzparkplatz in front of the arrival hall. Chance of getting such ride might be better at the Abflugstrasse as the driver going back has free place, but the with the arriving ones you will surely hear fresh travel stories.\\n\\n\\n=== West towards [[Linz]], [[Salzburg]], [[Munich]] {{Aat|1}} {{European Route Number|60}} ===\\n\\n==== Option 1: Petrol station Unter-St. Veit ====\\n\\nTake the U4 to \\'\\'Ober St. Veit\\'\\' and you\\'ll find a petrol station on the other side of the road.

There is a bus stop which is a well known hitching spot. Change cars (if necessary) at the [[rest area]]s \\'\\'[[Sankt Pölten|St. Pölten]]\\'\\' or \\'\\'Ansfelden\\'\\'. Since a direct ride to Salzburg is possible try to avoid \"part-rides\" and avoid going to St. Polten at all cost- the traffic there is very low and mostly local. From here you can as well get to option \"2\" by crossing the motorway via the bridge and walk for about 2km to the right.<br>\\n\\n==== Option 3: OMV petrol station on Wiener Straße (A1) ====\\n\\nTake train (S50) to \\'\\'Wien Wolf in der Au\\'\\'. Then cross over the bridge. You\\'ll see the petrol station after about 300m to your left. Cross the bridge and then it\\'s a short walk behind the barrier along the side of the road.  There is as a big resting area with service station.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Prague]] ===\\n\\nThe easiest way to get from Vienna to Prague is to go through [[Brno]]. \\n\\nThere is an option to go straight from Vienna to Prague. Take a train from \\'\\'Handelskai\\'\\' to \\'\\'Kornneuburg\\'\\'. Get out of the station and turn left. You\\'ll get to a street called Doktor-Max-Burckhard-Ring, it will take you to the main street (Stockerauer Straße) Follow the main street, and then turn left on any of the first two streets (Scherzgasse or Hofaustraße) Turn right, and you\\'ll get to the street that crosses the railways. Cross the railway and walk further until you see an on-ramp. There is also a petrol station to hitchhike from. However, most cars are only going to nearby towns from which it is not possible to hitchhike further. Again, try going through Brno instead.\\n\\n\\n=== North towards [[Brno]] ([[Czech Republic]]) {{European Route Number|461}} ===\\n\\n[[File:MrTweek.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[MrTweek]] hitching to [[Vienna]]]]\\n\\n====Option 1====\\n\\nFrom central Wien take tram 31 to the last stop, \\'\\'Stammersdorf\\'\\'.

There you can get in the bus 713 and get off at ''Mory'' (The first stop on public transport zone 2 (''strefa II'')). Walk back around 200m in the direction your bus came from, until the on-ramp of the A2 snd hitchike there\\n\\nB.

From the pedestrian crossing over the tracks you can already spot the highway's noise barrier to the north-west. Follow the road on the northern side of the train station to the north, turn right at the next crossing and the road should lead you through an under-bridge under the highway after a couple of minutes. After, you cross the road and arrive at the on-ramp described under ''#1''. The whole walk is around 1,5km.\\n\\nYou can take the trains from platform #3 at ''Warszawa Śródmieście'' which is next to the Central Station\\n\\n====Option 4, S2 bus stop on the entry to bypass from southern part of the city==== \\n{{Coords|52.1398|21.0161}}<br>\\nTake the bus from metro station ''Wilanowska'' to the stop ''Żołny'' (lines 319, 709, 715, 727, 739). Then go back a bit to the direction you arrived under the overpass and turn left. There is a place where a lot of the southern inhabitants of Warsaw go to A2. There is an unused bus stop on the highway entrance. There is enough space to stop a truck. The drivers will come around the bend, but if you stay at the end of the bus stop they will go slow enough and they will have much time to see you and stop. It is a great place to catch direct car to [[Łódź]], to [[Poznań]] or even [[Gdańsk]] you can change on the service station (MOP) ''Nowosady'' (there are Burger King and Shell gas station), if the driver comes to Łódź and you want to go west or north it is important to left before A1 and A2 junction.\\n\\n====Option 5, National road 92 slower option==== \\n{{Coords|52.2103|20.7997}}<br>\\nIf you wish to take the old main road DK92 (not advisable if you want to travel fast...) you can use a place which takes a bit more time to reach:\\n\\nTake the ''KM3'' train in direction of [[Łowicz]] or [[Sochaczew]] and get out at ''Ożarów Mazowiecki''. \\n\\nWhen you get out at the station in ''Ożarów Mazowiecki'' (make sure you keep an eye out for the correct station, Ożarów Mazowiecki only has one sign at the end of the station) just leave the station to the right (facing away from Warsaw) and follow ''Marii Konopnickiej'' Street until you reach a bigger street, ''Poznańska'' (about 500m). Another few hundred meters to the East you will find a bus stop with plenty of space to stop (it's across the street from the church). It's just one lane, cars are going quite slow and you avoid a great deal of local traffic out of Warsaw.

Using a large sign can be very effective.\\n\\n As of 2020, there's new piece of S8 expressway, which goes around Janki. You can go to ''P+R Aleja Krakowska'' as mentioned before. From there take bus 721 in direction of ''Kosów'' or 728 towards ''Złotokłos''. You can go out on stop ''Sękocin Las'' (Second one, after the crossing & joining with main road. There are two stops with same name, if you get out on first, right one is ~100m further). There's some forest if you want to sleep, but not a lot of lights for after sunlight.

Savski most a bus terminal where you can catch buses #111 or #132. These buses pass by the pay tolls \"Lučko\". Get off after 15 minutes of ride at bus stop  Put Za Leskovac . You can recognise a big restaurant \"Calypso\". Once you get off you will see that one road goes over the bridge - take the other road that doesn\\'t go over the bridge, take first left and go through the parking lot and voila! you\\'re there. \\n\\nAlso if you walk a bit highway forward you get on the Crodux petrol station. There is less traffic than on tolls.\\n\\nIf you are going to \\'\\'Dalmatia\\'\\' (Zadar, Split, etc.) don\\'t take rides to Rijeka because it is a bit out of your way. Car plates for each city: Pula and Istria (PU), Rijeka (RI) Zadar (ZD) Šibenik (ŠI) Split (ST).\\n\\n*\\'\\' I followed the instructions about the bus to go to the Lucko toll station. The bus driver was very frıendly and explained me where to get off. From the busstop towards the toll station is 10 minutes walk. I first tried at the toll station for one hour with no luck. Then I changed strategy and I walked towards the first petrol station behind the toll station. Here you can find more shade facilities and cleaner air. Also you are able to talk to drivers. Most of the cars where tourısts with no space left. It took me 3 hours to fınd a direct ride to Split. But it was worth it. Although there is less traffic at the petrol station I believe it is a better option than the toll station. Good Luck. May 2012. Len \\'\\'\\n\\n*\" I\\'m always lucky with this spot, no matter where I am heading. I wait about 5-10 minutes when going to Rijeka and about 20-30 when going to Zadar, Šibenik or Split. But then again, I\\'m a girl. HAVE A SIGN with car plates of the city you\\'re going to. December 2012, Nina_Unexia \"\\n\\n*\" July 2015: spot worked well. There\\'s a lot of police around, but they seemed not to care at all. Be careful of getting dropped on one of the rest areas though, there are quite many so traffic isn\\'t very heavy on each one, and in the summertime almost all traffic is fully loaded vacation cars heading for the coast. The best rest stop before the highway split at Bosiljevo is probably Draganic, as it has both a Burger King and a Marche Bistro. We were stuck at Vukova Gorica rest area for hours.\"\\n\\n*\" Even though the ticket inspectors are more common now and the bus drivers control if you have the ticket, these buses (#111 and #132) are almost always crowded so you can still sneak in without buying a ticket. April 2014, Nina_Unexia \"\\n\\n*\" You can skip the bus part - just exit the tram (14 or 7) on \"Jadranska avenija\" which is the name of the street in which you will get after crossing the bridge and following a small road going east (with some bigger shops on your right), you can hitch on the spot where the small street is flowing into the big one, the cars go fast but there is space - even a truck. If they\\'re not going your way, just ask to be dropped at the pay toll. Great place for finding long rides. --[[User:Uyku.tulumu|Uyku.tulumu]] ([[User talk:Uyku.tulumu|talk]]) 18:38, 15 March 2013 (CET) \"\\n\\nFurther to the above directions, you\\'ll stay on tram 14 until it\\'s crossed the river, then find yourself on the lower level of a motorway roundabout junction.  You have several possible exits under bridges.  When you get off the tram with the river to your back, go right.  You\\'ll see a Billa supermarket and a McD\\'s.  There is a slip road there with a decent dirt layby where cars can pull in.  Have a sign that reads \\'LUCKO\\' and you\\'ll easily get a lift to the toll station five minutes up the road.  From there it\\'s easy pickings.  --[[User:Looking for Stu|Looking for Stu]] ([[User talk:Looking for Stu|talk]]) 10:42, 14 May 2013 (CEST)\\n\\n*\" July 2017 : I were in this spot and i have some advices . Really really really avoid WEEKENDS ! I were there a saturday and the jam were incredible with cars and vans full of people and staffs from many europenas countries heading to croitian costs. I didn\\'t found a problem for the stop of the bus because we were 10 or 12 people( all locals except me) heading to split and other destinations. I waited maybe 2 or 3 hours in a very hot day , so i went to the petrol station 200 metres from the poll station to refresh , and some local news catch me for interview xD . My ride was fun because both of us spoke about sports and football ;)) . he was nice and ride me to Zadar poll station, so i took another stop from there to the bus station (10 minutes) . Good luck and from my personal opinion ovoid weekend guys !\\n\\n=== Direction [[Osijek, Slavonski Brod]], [[Belgrade]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] ===\\n__TOC__\\nTHEY MOVED TOLL STATION 8KM TOWARDS EAST, so going to Dumovec is no longer a good option. Get on a bus #216 or #276 from Kvaternikov trg and get off at a stop called \\'\\'Ivanjorečka pošta\\'\\' (post office in Ivanja Reka), cross the street and follow the road going on the right, it\\'s called \\'\\'Rimski put\\'\\', it will take you straight to Tifon petrol station. There you can ask drivers to take you to the toll station (in croatian: naplatne kućice) or hitch on the road.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'THE BEST OPTION\\'\\' to Serbia and Hungary\\'\\nI was hitchhiking around 10 times from this spot and always got a ride within a minute or two. Take a bus 216 or 276 from Kvaternikov trg to Ivanja reka. After about 25 minutes of ride, you should see a small church on your right side (https://goo.gl/maps/pwcr0). Get off the bus, walk back to the church and turn right. This street is going directly to the entrance of the highway. You have to walk around 5 minutes and you will see an intersection with a traffic light (https://goo.gl/maps/doL7v). Ask drivers at traffic light to take you to the toll gate Ivanja Reka which is now farther than it used to be before, but don\\'t worry. Same HH spot if you are going north towards Budapest, just ask people if they are going to the north toll gate. (by [[User:NixyJungle|NixyJungle]])\\n\\nYou have three options for these destinations. \\n* First option is outdated and deleted. Look up for updated version.\\n* Second option is to get the tram #2, #3 or #13 to \\'\\'Savišće\\'\\' or \\'\\'Žitnjak\\'\\'. Get out at the last stop and then walk for about 15 minutes towards the motorway. On the motorway you\\'ll find a bus stop and there you can easily hitchhike towards the on-ramp in \\'\\'Ivanja Reka\\'\\' or you can even stop cars who are going to Belgrade or Bosnia. Ask the locals for extra tips and explanations.\\n: \\n- [[User:Chillion|Chillion]] (2018) This method is good. About 5-10mins before the bus stops (there are two on the same Street), is a church where you can fill up your water bottles at the tap inside the church yard. When I hitched from the bus stop I had both \"Slavonska Brod\"  and \"Ivanja Reka\" signs. After using both, the latter sign got me a ride in 5 mins, taking me to the town of Ivanja, where I was dropped off on the highway in the direction of Serbia. Got to Serbia that same day (1 car and 2 truck rides).\\n\\n\\'\\'[[User:nuclearphyllis|Nuclearphyllis]]\\' local experts took him to the first toll station on the Zagreb-Belgrade motorway, even though it was illegal to hitchhike from there. They weren\\'t troubled and got a ride within 10 minutes.\\'\\'\\n* Third option, go to Savski most and get on IKEA bus. It will take you to IKEA, and this is right on the highway to Belgrade, next to Dumovec. This bus ticket costs 10 kuna and you can use 5 kuna discount in IKEA for food or coffee. \\nBus leaves Savski most station at Mon-Sat: 9:00, 10:00, 12:00, 14:00, 16:00, 18:00\\nSun: 9:00, 10:00, 12:00, 14:00, 16:00\\nHere are the stops:\\nhttp://www.ikea.com/ms/hr_HR/about_store/ikea_bus.html?icid=hr%7Citl%7Chpl%7Ctxt_link_bus_line\\n\\n*I hitched 3 times in direction of Belgrade, so just one tip - if the car that is giving you a ride goes to Slavonski Brod (half way before Belgrade) ask him to drop you off at EAST EXIT of the city. in Croatian - ISTOČNI IZLAZ. because, if he drops you off at west exit, 95% of cars go to direction of Zagreb, I waited there 2 hours once, and the second time 3 hours ;)\\n\\nI could just add if you need to go from Zagreb to Osijek on high way A3 and a lot of cars are driving forward to Slavonski Brod Belgrade. You need to go out on turn to Đakovo and Osijek(high way A5). Than you walk right to high way and just climb up till turning for Osijek direction and hitchhike there at the beginning, cars need to slow down when they join to high way that leads to Osijek. If driver left you after Đakovo on some rest place near high way, try not to stuck up or avoid that.  Because on this high way in one hour maybe 15 cars passed by, so it is not so crowded with cars even that is main high way, try to catch ride directly to Osijek. People probably do not use often this high way becaue you must pay fee for driving there and normal road is free.\\n\\n=== Direction [[Budapest]], [[Varazdin]] and [[Cakovec]] ===\\n(Read below, this one doesn\\'t exist anymore! The best option is on the bottom - to HH on Slavonska avenija ) Take bus number 216 from Kvaternikov trg to the last stop in Ivanja Reka or bus 276 till 2 stations before the final station. Ask for the church in Ivanja Reka, people will know it, you should get out there. There will be a small road which leads to the on ramp, ask people for which one it is. You should walk till the traffic lights, the turn right and you already see the place. After the lights you should walk about 300 meters and you can start hitching there with a sign VZ for example. Works like a charm, someone waited there for less than 10 minutes.<br />\\n[[User:NixyJungle|NixyJungle]] edit: No need to walk 300 meters after traffic lights. You can ask people on the traffic light. It\\'s easier and more safe, plus, if the police comes, you are legal, because sign for the beginning of the highway and forbidden hitchhiking is 200 meters after the traffic light.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Update\\'\\'\\': This place doesn\\'t exist anymore, as the new road was built and there\\'s no stopping lane, so cars can\\'t stop to pick you up. Don\\'t hitchhike here.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Update - april 2012\\'\\'\\': There is able to hitchhike there, last year I was there, but it is \\'\\'\\'very hard to get out of there\\'\\'\\'. You need reach \\'\\'petrol station\\'\\' and the exit from station has got long shoulder where U can safely try to cach someone.\\n\\nThree problems:\\n#90% of cars which stop are those which leave the station.\\n#From those who stops almost everyone was local people.\\n#It was my one of the longest stops (no less than 3 houers).\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Update\\'\\'\\': The main problem with direction towards Hungary is that pay tolls are quite far away from Zagreb, so it would be easier if you first get to the pay tolls. The best starting point is the \"Tifon\" petrol station as it\\'s the furthest hitchhiking spot on the way to Varaždin and Budapest you can get to by public transportation (directions to there are already described in the directions to Belgrade section on the top of this topic - bus 216 or 176 from Kvaternikov trg...) and hold a sign \"ZELINA\" (the closest town to the pay tolls) or \"SV. HELENA\" (the exact name of that pay tolls). Many drivers get off the highway just before the pay tolls, so maybe you\\'ll have to walk a few kilometers. But once you\\'re there, you can easily get a ride straight to Budapest.\\n\\nSecond option is to hitchhike on Slavonska avenija, this way you dont have to take any public transportation. You can stand after the crossroad of Slavonska avenija and Ulica Josipa Marohnića. Many people go towards the highway on this road. We hitchhiked with the sign \"Sesvete\", got a ride in 15 mins and got dropped at the petrol station right in front of highway ramps in Ivanja Reka. From here we hitchhiked with sign \"Varazdin\" and got a ride in 15-20 mins and got dropped at the pay tolls towards north.\\n\\nNote: this (the crossing of Slavonska avenija and Ul. Ulica Josipa Marohnića) seems to be the best and easiest option. Many cars in the direction, there\\'re traffic lights + lot of space for cars to stop. From the central square (Trg bana Josipa Jelačića) you can either walk (southwards, 3km) or take trams 14 (direction ZAPRUĐE) or 17 (direction BORONGAJ)  for 15mins till the stop Vjesnik. The stop is near the crossing of Savska cesta and Slavonska avenija, so you have to walk 10min till the spot where Ul. Ulica Josipa Marohnića is. You can hold sign VŽ (Varaždin). Once you get a ride and are on the highway, be sure to get off at the first petrol station (OMV, some 20kms from the starting point), because it\\'s also the last one before Varaždin!\\n\\n[[User:Gallar|Gallar]] hitch-hiked (with girlfriend) from crossroad of Slavonska avenija and Ulica Josipa Marohnića and he waited 9 hours just for a single lift to mentioned OMV station. It might be bad luck, but be aware there is no better place to hike and yet this one might be not so perfect.\\n\\nNote: This can\\'t be a good hitchhiking spot by any reason as it\\'s too much inside the town and there\\'s too much of local traffic, also there are more cars coming to Zagreb from the west than those departing to the east. However, it\\'s not impossible, but getting a lift there in a normal time is more about the luck...\\n\\nUpdate: I think the best spot to hitchhike from is the gas station on Slavonska avenija 110, you can get there by taking 286 bus and walking for like 15 mins, even though it\\'s like 40 mins from the city centre but there is plenty of room to stop, also I dont recommend going to Varazdin and hoping to get a ride at the toll booth going to the highway because the traffic is pretty small there and mainly not towards budapest. There is a gas station before Varazdin(like 10 km) and we got a ride from there in like 5 mins.\\n\\nJune 2019\\n\\nAnother good option is to take the tram until Dubec.  At least 3 different lines end there.  Once you get there look for a bus going to Sesvete.  There will most likely be many people trying to board and you should be able to enter from any door.  The ride shouldn’t take more then 10 minutes and you will find it makes a left turn followed by two right turns soon after.  This is where you want to get off and cross the street. (Veraždinska cesta; bus stop Selčina) The bus stop on this side is slightly further up the road. You will then want bus 273 going to Lužan. (Someone entered this bus from the middle door as well.)  Take bus 273 to the end of the line.  From here it is just a 3.2 kilometer walk to the first gas station directly on the highway.  There is a gravel road after you cross over the highway which you can easily reach by going a couple hundred meters past the highway.  (No need to try and cross the ditch to reach it.) As you approach the gas station fence and the road turns to lead around the back you will see a gap where you can easily hop the fence and follow a well formed path directly to the parking lot.  It should be just a handful of meters after the curve and very easy to notice.\\n\\nThere are also plenty of good places where one can pitch a tent for the night if one wants to come out here in the evening and get a nice and early start the following morning.\\n\\n=== Direction [[Ljubljana]], [[Austria]], [[Novo Mesto]] ===\\n\\'\\'\\'From town\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nTake tram #5 or #17 from the centre of Zagreb towards the \\'\\'Precko\\'\\'. Notice that the ride takes a lot of time, 45 minutes at least. In \\'\\'Precko\\'\\', exit the tram and walk left. You\\'ll see a street that turns right. Take this street and walk 5 minutes till you get to the main street \\'\\'Ljubljanska Avenija\\'\\' (also called \\'\\'Zagrebacka Avenija\\'\\'). Cross this street in front of the \\'\\'Konzum\\'\\' supermarket and turn left. You will see a small bus station, this is your spot. However most people commute from this point. Best is to hitchhike from there with a SLO sign. Don\\'t take rides that don\\'t take you at least to the border - There is no good places to hitchhike further down the road. From the border crossing itself it\\'s relatively easy to get a good ride, even as far as to Austria.\\n\\nOn a [[Good times to hitchhike|Sunday]] Erga and [[User:Guaka|guaka]] waited way to long. Not a single car stopped in two hours time, and at the petrol stations everyone with space pretended not to go anywhere near Slovenia (West or North). Two Belgian guys didn\\'t manage to get a ride in the same period, also trying in different spots in the area ([[User:Guaka|guaka]] somehow convinced the West Gate bus driver to also pick them up). Use the West Gate option if you\\'re simply heading to Austria, find another solution if you\\'re heading towards Ljubljana...\\n\\nAfter more than one hour of waiting, I went further down the road to the next bus stop (in front of FORD car dealer center) where most of the local traffic is gone and I found a ride after 15min.\\n\\n* I recommend following this advice, after going to the Konzum market to get some food and cardboard I spent only 40 mn before someone offered to take me to Slovenia. You are highly visible and this worked at dawn.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'INA Lučko - north\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nINA Lučko - north is a big rest stop just outside Zagreb, and it takes quite a long time to come there from the city center. You have to take a tram to Savski most and then bus line 112 or 168 to Lučko centar. Don\\'t panic when you won\\'t see any shopping center as you expect, this place looks like a village;) from there, you walk for about 2km to reach the stop.\\n\\nIt is good place to hitchhike and locals told me that\\'s where everybody goes. For me it took whole 3.5h to get a pick (december 2019), but it was one day before christmas, so the place was deserted. I got a direct ride to Ljubljana after all, so i can recommend.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Take a bus to the highway\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nThis option takes you a bit longer to get started with (nearly an hour), it takes you directly to the highway though.\\n\\n== Much better option to Slovenia ==\\nTake a bus number 112 from \"Savski most\" bus station. Get of the bus at the last station. You should see highway from that place. If you don\\'t, ask for the direction. Above highway you will see an overpass. Go to the opposite side and hitchhike there at the entrance of the road. There is a petrol station with many cars entering the highway. If it\\'s easier for you, it is a place called Motel Plitvice and it\\'s here https://goo.gl/maps/eM865 (by [[User:NixyJungle|NixyJungle]])\\n\\nCaution: On a Sunday check the [http://www.zet.t-com.hr/media/144255/112nnn.pdf schedule for bus 112], since it does not depart very frequently that day - [[User:Questrayer|Questrayer]] had to wait for about 80 minutes. Apart from that, this option is very good, and he got a ride all the way to Ljubljana within 15 minutes approaching people at the petrol station.  \\n\\n=== North, direction [[Maribor]], [[Graz]], [[Vienna]] ===\\n==== First option ====\\nFrom the Črnomerec and Ljubljanica bus terminal there\\'s a free bus (red or white colour) to West Gate shopping centre which is adjacent to toll station (check out the West Gate Zagreb page to find out its schedule), see also [http://maps.google.com/?q=zagreb&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=City+of+Zagreb,+Croatia&ll=45.874518,15.829003&spn=0.009815,0.02459&t=h&z=16 Google Maps], the toll station is very close to the shopping center, you can see it from the parking lot where the bus arrives. But you will have to cross a bit of water. Don\\'t try this in the dark. Look for one of the areas with stones covered by metal or just walk about 300 metre in opposite direction of the shopping mall and you will find a little bridge, handy! then come back to the toll station.\\n\\nIf you\\'re heading to [[Slovenia]] or further you\\'ll have to make it to the [[Macelj-Kozminci border crossing]], from where you can easily get rides far into [[Germany]].\\n\\nYou better forget about trying the Precko option (towards Ljubljana), Erga and [[User:Guaka|guaka]] waited for about 2 hours, asking people, with signs (\\'\\'Macelj\\'\\', \\'\\'Maribor\\'\\', SLO) and without sign. Fortunately the free bus to the West Gate center also goes from this above spot.\\n\\n[[User:T0ma5|t0ma5]] was hitchhiking here in January 2011 and he got a ride all the way to Vienna in about 20min.\\n\\n[[User:Cro_gavran|Cro_gavran]] tried to hitchhike here in September 2014 but was in just few minutes forced to leave by highway guards. They said that same day they moved out from highway already 5 hitchhikers and called police to arrest two who didnt wanted to leave the highway. If someone else had same experience, please share.\\n\\n[[User:Uncle sam01|uncle_sam01]] hitched a direct ride to Bratislava in about 20 minutes in August 2015. Definitely wouldn\\'t recommend going over the bridge, since the right side is virtually impossible to walk towards the highway (bushes, trees, water, weeds, etc.). In August 2015 there was only a relatively short fence, which was easy to climb over but you must cross the highway, which is obviously not the safest thing to do, but cars go slow and there are no barriers in the middle. No one bothered us, except some maintenance guy in a pick up who was driving by, but we couldn\\'t make out what he was saying and no one from the toll booths told us anything even though they clearly saw us hitching.\\n\\n--[[User:Yeguaerrante|Yeguaerrante]] ([[User talk:Yeguaerrante|talk]]) 13:05, 18 November 2015 (CET) You can\\'t get to the toll station, it\\'s all fenced, i waited on the road after going for the blue small bridge, you will see a bridge that crosses the highway, a car pick me up after 20 min and took me to small town area, was really hard to get into the highway this way because there was a lot of locals not going too far away. \\n\\n--[[User:Duffajfka|Duffajfka]] walked from the shopping centre along D1 in the direction back to Zagreb until the highway ramp to the north. As it\\'s a two lane one with not too dense traffic, he tried to hitchhike from the guardrail with a sign \"Odmorište\" (service area), probably \"Naplatna Postaja\" (toll booth) would be easier. As he has already been inside the fence, he walked to the toll booth. It was quite a hard walk, but probably worth it. Tried to hitch right from the gates but was expelled by the staff few tens of meters behind the booth, where a car to Graz easily stopped in 20 mins. (May 2019)\\n \\nAs alternative, try to get Plitvice petrol station (not to confuse with famous National park!). It is reachable from Lučko trough the village. It is around 3 km walk.\\n\\n==== Second option ====\\n\\nInstead of the seemingly risky toll station, you can also get a bus to King Cross shopping center or simply walk along Ljubljanska avenija until you reach the on-ramp of the highway. The spot is an approach road of a nearby, not very frequented truck park and offers great visibility and space to pull over for bypassing drivers. [[User:Vapaakulkuri|vapaakulkuri]] however still had to wait about two hours to get a ride to the first gas station that is located about 20km down the road.\\n\\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\\n\\n[[trash:Zagreb]] [[nomad:Zagreb]]\\n\\n\\n[[Category:E65]]\\n[[Category:E59]]\\n[[Category:E71]]',\n",

Savski most a bus terminal where you can catch buses #111 or #132. These buses pass by the pay tolls \"Lučko\". Get off after 15 minutes of ride at bus stop  Put Za Leskovac . You can recognise a big restaurant \"Calypso\". Once you get off you will see that one road goes over the bridge - take the other road that doesn\\'t go over the bridge, take first left and go through the parking lot and voila! you\\'re there. \\n\\nAlso if you walk a bit highway forward you get on the Crodux petrol station. There is less traffic than on tolls.\\n\\nIf you are going to \\'\\'Dalmatia\\'\\' (Zadar, Split, etc.) don\\'t take rides to Rijeka because it is a bit out of your way. Car plates for each city: Pula and Istria (PU), Rijeka (RI) Zadar (ZD) Šibenik (ŠI) Split (ST).\\n\\n*\\'\\' I followed the instructions about the bus to go to the Lucko toll station. The bus driver was very frıendly and explained me where to get off. From the busstop towards the toll station is 10 minutes walk. I first tried at the toll station for one hour with no luck. Then I changed strategy and I walked towards the first petrol station behind the toll station. Here you can find more shade facilities and cleaner air. Also you are able to talk to drivers. Most of the cars where tourısts with no space left. It took me 3 hours to fınd a direct ride to Split. But it was worth it. Although there is less traffic at the petrol station I believe it is a better option than the toll station. Good Luck. May 2012. Len \\'\\'\\n\\n*\" I\\'m always lucky with this spot, no matter where I am heading. I wait about 5-10 minutes when going to Rijeka and about 20-30 when going to Zadar, Šibenik or Split. But then again, I\\'m a girl. HAVE A SIGN with car plates of the city you\\'re going to. December 2012, Nina_Unexia \"\\n\\n*\" July 2015: spot worked well. There\\'s a lot of police around, but they seemed not to care at all. Be careful of getting dropped on one of the rest areas though, there are quite many so traffic isn\\'t very heavy on each one, and in the summertime almost all traffic is fully loaded vacation cars heading for the coast. The best rest stop before the highway split at Bosiljevo is probably Draganic, as it has both a Burger King and a Marche Bistro. We were stuck at Vukova Gorica rest area for hours.\"\\n\\n*\" Even though the ticket inspectors are more common now and the bus drivers control if you have the ticket, these buses (#111 and #132) are almost always crowded so you can still sneak in without buying a ticket. April 2014, Nina_Unexia \"\\n\\n*\" You can skip the bus part - just exit the tram (14 or 7) on \"Jadranska avenija\" which is the name of the street in which you will get after crossing the bridge and following a small road going east (with some bigger shops on your right), you can hitch on the spot where the small street is flowing into the big one, the cars go fast but there is space - even a truck. If they\\'re not going your way, just ask to be dropped at the pay toll. Great place for finding long rides. --[[User:Uyku.tulumu|Uyku.tulumu]] ([[User talk:Uyku.tulumu|talk]]) 18:38, 15 March 2013 (CET) \"\\n\\nFurther to the above directions, you\\'ll stay on tram 14 until it\\'s crossed the river, then find yourself on the lower level of a motorway roundabout junction.  You have several possible exits under bridges.  When you get off the tram with the river to your back, go right.  You\\'ll see a Billa supermarket and a McD\\'s.  There is a slip road there with a decent dirt layby where cars can pull in.  Have a sign that reads \\'LUCKO\\' and you\\'ll easily get a lift to the toll station five minutes up the road.  From there it\\'s easy pickings.  --[[User:Looking for Stu|Looking for Stu]] ([[User talk:Looking for Stu|talk]]) 10:42, 14 May 2013 (CEST)\\n\\n*\" July 2017 : I were in this spot and i have some advices . Really really really avoid WEEKENDS ! I were there a saturday and the jam were incredible with cars and vans full of people and staffs from many europenas countries heading to croitian costs. I didn\\'t found a problem for the stop of the bus because we were 10 or 12 people( all locals except me) heading to split and other destinations. I waited maybe 2 or 3 hours in a very hot day , so i went to the petrol station 200 metres from the poll station to refresh , and some local news catch me for interview xD . My ride was fun because both of us spoke about sports and football ;)) . he was nice and ride me to Zadar poll station, so i took another stop from there to the bus station (10 minutes) . Good luck and from my personal opinion ovoid weekend guys !\\n\\n=== Direction [[Osijek, Slavonski Brod]], [[Belgrade]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] ===\\n__TOC__\\nTHEY MOVED TOLL STATION 8KM TOWARDS EAST, so going to Dumovec is no longer a good option. Get on a bus #216 or #276 from Kvaternikov trg and get off at a stop called \\'\\'Ivanjorečka pošta\\'\\' (post office in Ivanja Reka), cross the street and follow the road going on the right, it\\'s called \\'\\'Rimski put\\'\\', it will take you straight to Tifon petrol station. There you can ask drivers to take you to the toll station (in croatian: naplatne kućice) or hitch on the road.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'THE BEST OPTION\\'\\' to Serbia and Hungary\\'\\nI was hitchhiking around 10 times from this spot and always got a ride within a minute or two. Take a bus 216 or 276 from Kvaternikov trg to Ivanja reka. After about 25 minutes of ride, you should see a small church on your right side (https://goo.gl/maps/pwcr0). Get off the bus, walk back to the church and turn right. This street is going directly to the entrance of the highway. You have to walk around 5 minutes and you will see an intersection with a traffic light (https://goo.gl/maps/doL7v). Ask drivers at traffic light to take you to the toll gate Ivanja Reka which is now farther than it used to be before, but don\\'t worry. Same HH spot if you are going north towards Budapest, just ask people if they are going to the north toll gate. (by [[User:NixyJungle|NixyJungle]])\\n\\nYou have three options for these destinations. \\n* First option is outdated and deleted. Look up for updated version.\\n* Second option is to get the tram #2, #3 or #13 to \\'\\'Savišće\\'\\' or \\'\\'Žitnjak\\'\\'. Get out at the last stop and then walk for about 15 minutes towards the motorway. On the motorway you\\'ll find a bus stop and there you can easily hitchhike towards the on-ramp in \\'\\'Ivanja Reka\\'\\' or you can even stop cars who are going to Belgrade or Bosnia. Ask the locals for extra tips and explanations.\\n: \\n- [[User:Chillion|Chillion]] (2018) This method is good. About 5-10mins before the bus stops (there are two on the same Street), is a church where you can fill up your water bottles at the tap inside the church yard. When I hitched from the bus stop I had both \"Slavonska Brod\"  and \"Ivanja Reka\" signs. After using both, the latter sign got me a ride in 5 mins, taking me to the town of Ivanja, where I was dropped off on the highway in the direction of Serbia. Got to Serbia that same day (1 car and 2 truck rides).\\n\\n\\'\\'[[User:nuclearphyllis|Nuclearphyllis]]\\' local experts took him to the first toll station on the Zagreb-Belgrade motorway, even though it was illegal to hitchhike from there. They weren\\'t troubled and got a ride within 10 minutes.\\'\\'\\n* Third option, go to Savski most and get on IKEA bus. It will take you to IKEA, and this is right on the highway to Belgrade, next to Dumovec. This bus ticket costs 10 kuna and you can use 5 kuna discount in IKEA for food or coffee. \\nBus leaves Savski most station at Mon-Sat: 9:00, 10:00, 12:00, 14:00, 16:00, 18:00\\nSun: 9:00, 10:00, 12:00, 14:00, 16:00\\nHere are the stops:\\nhttp://www.ikea.com/ms/hr_HR/about_store/ikea_bus.html?icid=hr%7Citl%7Chpl%7Ctxt_link_bus_line\\n\\n*I hitched 3 times in direction of Belgrade, so just one tip - if the car that is giving you a ride goes to Slavonski Brod (half way before Belgrade) ask him to drop you off at EAST EXIT of the city. in Croatian - ISTOČNI IZLAZ. because, if he drops you off at west exit, 95% of cars go to direction of Zagreb, I waited there 2 hours once, and the second time 3 hours ;)\\n\\nI could just add if you need to go from Zagreb to Osijek on high way A3 and a lot of cars are driving forward to Slavonski Brod Belgrade. You need to go out on turn to Đakovo and Osijek(high way A5). Than you walk right to high way and just climb up till turning for Osijek direction and hitchhike there at the beginning, cars need to slow down when they join to high way that leads to Osijek. If driver left you after Đakovo on some rest place near high way, try not to stuck up or avoid that.  Because on this high way in one hour maybe 15 cars passed by, so it is not so crowded with cars even that is main high way, try to catch ride directly to Osijek. People probably do not use often this high way becaue you must pay fee for driving there and normal road is free.\\n\\n=== Direction [[Budapest]], [[Varazdin]] and [[Cakovec]] ===\\n(Read below, this one doesn\\'t exist anymore! The best option is on the bottom - to HH on Slavonska avenija ) Take bus number 216 from Kvaternikov trg to the last stop in Ivanja Reka or bus 276 till 2 stations before the final station. Ask for the church in Ivanja Reka, people will know it, you should get out there. There will be a small road which leads to the on ramp, ask people for which one it is. You should walk till the traffic lights, the turn right and you already see the place. After the lights you should walk about 300 meters and you can start hitching there with a sign VZ for example. Works like a charm, someone waited there for less than 10 minutes.<br />\\n[[User:NixyJungle|NixyJungle]] edit: No need to walk 300 meters after traffic lights. You can ask people on the traffic light. It\\'s easier and more safe, plus, if the police comes, you are legal, because sign for the beginning of the highway and forbidden hitchhiking is 200 meters after the traffic light.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Update\\'\\'\\': This place doesn\\'t exist anymore, as the new road was built and there\\'s no stopping lane, so cars can\\'t stop to pick you up. Don\\'t hitchhike here.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Update - april 2012\\'\\'\\': There is able to hitchhike there, last year I was there, but it is \\'\\'\\'very hard to get out of there\\'\\'\\'. You need reach \\'\\'petrol station\\'\\' and the exit from station has got long shoulder where U can safely try to cach someone.\\n\\nThree problems:\\n#90% of cars which stop are those which leave the station.\\n#From those who stops almost everyone was local people.\\n#It was my one of the longest stops (no less than 3 houers).\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Update\\'\\'\\': The main problem with direction towards Hungary is that pay tolls are quite far away from Zagreb, so it would be easier if you first get to the pay tolls. The best starting point is the \"Tifon\" petrol station as it\\'s the furthest hitchhiking spot on the way to Varaždin and Budapest you can get to by public transportation (directions to there are already described in the directions to Belgrade section on the top of this topic - bus 216 or 176 from Kvaternikov trg...) and hold a sign \"ZELINA\" (the closest town to the pay tolls) or \"SV. HELENA\" (the exact name of that pay tolls). Many drivers get off the highway just before the pay tolls, so maybe you\\'ll have to walk a few kilometers. But once you\\'re there, you can easily get a ride straight to Budapest.\\n\\nSecond option is to hitchhike on Slavonska avenija, this way you dont have to take any public transportation. You can stand after the crossroad of Slavonska avenija and Ulica Josipa Marohnića. Many people go towards the highway on this road. We hitchhiked with the sign \"Sesvete\", got a ride in 15 mins and got dropped at the petrol station right in front of highway ramps in Ivanja Reka. From here we hitchhiked with sign \"Varazdin\" and got a ride in 15-20 mins and got dropped at the pay tolls towards north.\\n\\nNote: this (the crossing of Slavonska avenija and Ul. Ulica Josipa Marohnića) seems to be the best and easiest option. Many cars in the direction, there\\'re traffic lights + lot of space for cars to stop. From the central square (Trg bana Josipa Jelačića) you can either walk (southwards, 3km) or take trams 14 (direction ZAPRUĐE) or 17 (direction BORONGAJ)  for 15mins till the stop Vjesnik. The stop is near the crossing of Savska cesta and Slavonska avenija, so you have to walk 10min till the spot where Ul. Ulica Josipa Marohnića is. You can hold sign VŽ (Varaždin). Once you get a ride and are on the highway, be sure to get off at the first petrol station (OMV, some 20kms from the starting point), because it\\'s also the last one before Varaždin!\\n\\n[[User:Gallar|Gallar]] hitch-hiked (with girlfriend) from crossroad of Slavonska avenija and Ulica Josipa Marohnića and he waited 9 hours just for a single lift to mentioned OMV station. It might be bad luck, but be aware there is no better place to hike and yet this one might be not so perfect.\\n\\nNote: This can\\'t be a good hitchhiking spot by any reason as it\\'s too much inside the town and there\\'s too much of local traffic, also there are more cars coming to Zagreb from the west than those departing to the east. However, it\\'s not impossible, but getting a lift there in a normal time is more about the luck...\\n\\nUpdate: I think the best spot to hitchhike from is the gas station on Slavonska avenija 110, you can get there by taking 286 bus and walking for like 15 mins, even though it\\'s like 40 mins from the city centre but there is plenty of room to stop, also I dont recommend going to Varazdin and hoping to get a ride at the toll booth going to the highway because the traffic is pretty small there and mainly not towards budapest. There is a gas station before Varazdin(like 10 km) and we got a ride from there in like 5 mins.\\n\\nJune 2019\\n\\nAnother good option is to take the tram until Dubec.  At least 3 different lines end there.  Once you get there look for a bus going to Sesvete.  There will most likely be many people trying to board and you should be able to enter from any door.  The ride shouldn’t take more then 10 minutes and you will find it makes a left turn followed by two right turns soon after.  This is where you want to get off and cross the street. (Veraždinska cesta; bus stop Selčina) The bus stop on this side is slightly further up the road. You will then want bus 273 going to Lužan. (Someone entered this bus from the middle door as well.)  Take bus 273 to the end of the line.  From here it is just a 3.2 kilometer walk to the first gas station directly on the highway.  There is a gravel road after you cross over the highway which you can easily reach by going a couple hundred meters past the highway.  (No need to try and cross the ditch to reach it.) As you approach the gas station fence and the road turns to lead around the back you will see a gap where you can easily hop the fence and follow a well formed path directly to the parking lot.  It should be just a handful of meters after the curve and very easy to notice.\\n\\nThere are also plenty of good places where one can pitch a tent for the night if one wants to come out here in the evening and get a nice and early start the following morning.\\n\\n=== Direction [[Ljubljana]], [[Austria]], [[Novo Mesto]] ===\\n\\'\\'\\'From town\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nTake tram #5 or #17 from the centre of Zagreb towards the \\'\\'Precko\\'\\'. Notice that the ride takes a lot of time, 45 minutes at least. In \\'\\'Precko\\'\\', exit the tram and walk left. You\\'ll see a street that turns right. Take this street and walk 5 minutes till you get to the main street \\'\\'Ljubljanska Avenija\\'\\' (also called \\'\\'Zagrebacka Avenija\\'\\'). Cross this street in front of the \\'\\'Konzum\\'\\' supermarket and turn left. You will see a small bus station, this is your spot. However most people commute from this point. Best is to hitchhike from there with a SLO sign. Don\\'t take rides that don\\'t take you at least to the border - There is no good places to hitchhike further down the road. From the border crossing itself it\\'s relatively easy to get a good ride, even as far as to Austria.\\n\\nOn a [[Good times to hitchhike|Sunday]] Erga and [[User:Guaka|guaka]] waited way to long. Not a single car stopped in two hours time, and at the petrol stations everyone with space pretended not to go anywhere near Slovenia (West or North). Two Belgian guys didn\\'t manage to get a ride in the same period, also trying in different spots in the area ([[User:Guaka|guaka]] somehow convinced the West Gate bus driver to also pick them up). Use the West Gate option if you\\'re simply heading to Austria, find another solution if you\\'re heading towards Ljubljana...\\n\\nAfter more than one hour of waiting, I went further down the road to the next bus stop (in front of FORD car dealer center) where most of the local traffic is gone and I found a ride after 15min.\\n\\n* I recommend following this advice, after going to the Konzum market to get some food and cardboard I spent only 40 mn before someone offered to take me to Slovenia. You are highly visible and this worked at dawn.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'INA Lučko - north\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nINA Lučko - north is a big rest stop just outside Zagreb, and it takes quite a long time to come there from the city center. You have to take a tram to Savski most and then bus line 112 or 168 to Lučko centar. Don\\'t panic when you won\\'t see any shopping center as you expect, this place looks like a village;) from there, you walk for about 2km to reach the stop.\\n\\nIt is good place to hitchhike and locals told me that\\'s where everybody goes. For me it took whole 3.5h to get a pick (december 2019), but it was one day before christmas, so the place was deserted. I got a direct ride to Ljubljana after all, so i can recommend.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Take a bus to the highway\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nThis option takes you a bit longer to get started with (nearly an hour), it takes you directly to the highway though.\\n\\n== Much better option to Slovenia ==\\nTake a bus number 112 from \"Savski most\" bus station. Get of the bus at the last station. You should see highway from that place. If you don\\'t, ask for the direction. Above highway you will see an overpass. Go to the opposite side and hitchhike there at the entrance of the road. There is a petrol station with many cars entering the highway. If it\\'s easier for you, it is a place called Motel Plitvice and it\\'s here {{Coords|45.7747269|15.8804763}} (by [[User:NixyJungle|NixyJungle]])\\n\\nCaution: On a Sunday check the [http://www.zet.t-com.hr/media/144255/112nnn.pdf schedule for bus 112], since it does not depart very frequently that day - [[User:Questrayer|Questrayer]] had to wait for about 80 minutes. Apart from that, this option is very good, and he got a ride all the way to Ljubljana within 15 minutes approaching people at the petrol station.  \\n\\n=== North, direction [[Maribor]], [[Graz]], [[Vienna]] ===\\n==== First option ====\\nFrom the Črnomerec and Ljubljanica bus terminal there\\'s a free bus (red or white colour) to West Gate shopping centre which is adjacent to toll station (check out the West Gate Zagreb page to find out its schedule), see also [http://maps.google.com/?q=zagreb&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=City+of+Zagreb,+Croatia&ll=45.874518,15.829003&spn=0.009815,0.02459&t=h&z=16 Google Maps], the toll station is very close to the shopping center, you can see it from the parking lot where the bus arrives. But you will have to cross a bit of water. Don\\'t try this in the dark. Look for one of the areas with stones covered by metal or just walk about 300 metre in opposite direction of the shopping mall and you will find a little bridge, handy! then come back to the toll station.\\n\\nIf you\\'re heading to [[Slovenia]] or further you\\'ll have to make it to the [[Macelj-Kozminci border crossing]], from where you can easily get rides far into [[Germany]].\\n\\nYou better forget about trying the Precko option (towards Ljubljana), Erga and [[User:Guaka|guaka]] waited for about 2 hours, asking people, with signs (\\'\\'Macelj\\'\\', \\'\\'Maribor\\'\\', SLO) and without sign. Fortunately the free bus to the West Gate center also goes from this above spot.\\n\\n[[User:T0ma5|t0ma5]] was hitchhiking here in January 2011 and he got a ride all the way to Vienna in about 20min.\\n\\n[[User:Cro_gavran|Cro_gavran]] tried to hitchhike here in September 2014 but was in just few minutes forced to leave by highway guards. They said that same day they moved out from highway already 5 hitchhikers and called police to arrest two who didnt wanted to leave the highway. If someone else had same experience, please share.\\n\\n[[User:Uncle sam01|uncle_sam01]] hitched a direct ride to Bratislava in about 20 minutes in August 2015. Definitely wouldn\\'t recommend going over the bridge, since the right side is virtually impossible to walk towards the highway (bushes, trees, water, weeds, etc.). In August 2015 there was only a relatively short fence, which was easy to climb over but you must cross the highway, which is obviously not the safest thing to do, but cars go slow and there are no barriers in the middle. No one bothered us, except some maintenance guy in a pick up who was driving by, but we couldn\\'t make out what he was saying and no one from the toll booths told us anything even though they clearly saw us hitching.\\n\\n--[[User:Yeguaerrante|Yeguaerrante]] ([[User talk:Yeguaerrante|talk]]) 13:05, 18 November 2015 (CET) You can\\'t get to the toll station, it\\'s all fenced, i waited on the road after going for the blue small bridge, you will see a bridge that crosses the highway, a car pick me up after 20 min and took me to small town area, was really hard to get into the highway this way because there was a lot of locals not going too far away. \\n\\n--[[User:Duffajfka|Duffajfka]] walked from the shopping centre along D1 in the direction back to Zagreb until the highway ramp to the north. As it\\'s a two lane one with not too dense traffic, he tried to hitchhike from the guardrail with a sign \"Odmorište\" (service area), probably \"Naplatna Postaja\" (toll booth) would be easier. As he has already been inside the fence, he walked to the toll booth. It was quite a hard walk, but probably worth it. Tried to hitch right from the gates but was expelled by the staff few tens of meters behind the booth, where a car to Graz easily stopped in 20 mins. (May 2019)\\n \\nAs alternative, try to get Plitvice petrol station (not to confuse with famous National park!). It is reachable from Lučko trough the village. It is around 3 km walk.\\n\\n==== Second option ====\\n\\nInstead of the seemingly risky toll station, you can also get a bus to King Cross shopping center or simply walk along Ljubljanska avenija until you reach the on-ramp of the highway. The spot is an approach road of a nearby, not very frequented truck park and offers great visibility and space to pull over for bypassing drivers. [[User:Vapaakulkuri|vapaakulkuri]] however still had to wait about two hours to get a ride to the first gas station that is located about 20km down the road.\\n\\n== Trashwiki & Nomadwiki ==\\n\\n[[trash:Zagreb]] [[nomad:Zagreb]]\\n\\n\\n[[Category:E65]]\\n[[Category:E59]]\\n[[Category:E71]]'},\n",

Cross the tram tracks to the opposite platform and walk back about 30m in the direction the tram came to the lay-by on Pfingstweidstrasse.

There is a gate which opens in both direction that gives you access to this big gas station and you can access both sides of the motorway since the stations are connected.

To get to the onramp of the motorway from Bahnhof Wiedikon (a railway station nearby) take a look at [https://www.google.ch/maps/dir/Z%C3%BCrich+Wiedikon,+Z%C3%BCrich/Manessestrasse+20,+8003+Z%C3%BCrich/@47.3702897,8.522488,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x47900a1e9e5a5b63:0x35a0725eba643021!2m2!1d8.5235907!2d47.3714192!1m5!1m1!1s0x47900a1dbcf1e373:0xc912a02604833ebf!2m2!1d8.5250992!2d47.3692875!3e2 this map]. It is also possible to walk from the city center, it should take you about 15-20 min.\\n\\n\\nThis spot is also an option if you are heading for the canton of Graubünden, Austria, Liechtenstein, and southern Germany, especially Munich (via Bregenz).\\n\\nSince there is the bypass tunnel, you can also stay at the spot at Pfingstweidstrasse (look above) to go towards Luzern and Italy. There are not so many cars going in this direction, but it is a very kindly spot.\\n\\n\\nUpdate nov 2024: \\nThis spot is outside a fire station and is illegal to stop there, I would not say this is a good spot. If you want to hitch this road there is another spot just down the road right before the road splits and where the big signs are.\\n\\nIn my experience this spot is not very good, a lot off traffic but nobody stopped for me, and many are probably not going far. I think a way better way of getting out of Zürich is to take the bus to Affoltern where you can go to the gas station and raststätte right by the highway.\\n\\n=== North towards [[Germany]], east towards [[Austria]], [[Germany]] ===\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1\\'\\'\\' from city centre\\n\\nTo start towards Germany from the City Centre you can also take the public transport to Limmatplatz and walk over the Kornhausbrücke. On the other side of the bridge you take the stairs down to the Wasserwerkstrasse. Just some hundred meters from there the highway starts into a tunnel to the left. You can walk near the tunnel and take position in the middle of the street on the traffic island just in front of the traffic light. Like that the cars can see you easily and you can jump in, while it is red. Unfortunately, this position is not very comfortable because you are standing in the middle of the traffic (an I am not sure, if it is legal... but normally you come away quite fast). If you don`t like that (or if it is raining) you can also stay under the Kornhausbrücke. There is not so much traffic, but it is also ok. The best thing is to write Winterthur on your board. Like that you are coming to the petrol station Kempttal just in front of Winterthur.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2\\'\\'\\' BP petrol station\\n\\nTake S-Bahn S7 to Kemptthal (~25 minutes from the main station), then walk up the hill in the direction from where the train came from. After a 5 min walk, you should see a grassy hill on your right hand side. Walk to the top of the grassy hill and you will find a BP petrol station, a restaurant and a small COOP supermarket.\\n\\n\\n== Public Transport (Freeriding) ==\\n\\nOn the buses after 21.00 (when the controllers stop their work day) one has to enter at the front and show the driver their ticket, before then, one should be really careful because the conductors can come with a whole bunch of people and won\\'t let anyone out. Better to take the tram - according to a friend who grew up in Zurich the chance is very small that there will be a control, and after 21 there won\\'t be any controllers at all. \\n\\nHowever, if taking the tram during the day, and there is a control, you are going to be caught. They come in a giant group of ~15 and take up the entire station so you can\\'t escape. I was caught 8/2015 and plead poverty, although while I had my wallet out giving ID, he discovered I had euros (40), so he took that, saying I owed the remaining 60 and gave me a receipt/bill/ticket.\\n\\nYou can also reach everything in Zürich very easy by bike. Here you can rent bikes for free (you have to give a deposit): https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/aoz/de/index/shop/veloverleih.html\\n\\n\\n== Free Food / Free Concerts ==\\n\\nEvery Saturday you can go to a Bar called \"La Stanza\" in Bleicherweg 10 from 18:00 to 19:00, they will serve free pasta as long as they have some.\\nThis is a Homepage where a guy is collecting all the free concerts and interesting free stuff in Zürich: www.zuerifreikollekte.tk\\nThere is also www.zuerichunbezahlbar for a broader spectrum of free events like museum entries etc.\\n\\n\\n== Wild camping ==\\n\\nIn the Platzpromenade, there is a big tree big enough to set the tent inside, well hiden inside.\\n\\n\\n== Nomadwiki & Trashwiki ==\\n\\n{{nomadwiki}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{{Template:Cities Switzerland}}\\n\\n[[Category:Switzerland]]\\n[[Category:E60]]\\n[[Category:E41]]\\n\\n[[de:Zürich]]\\n[[tr:Zürih]]',\n",

It is the biggest city in Switzerland, but not its capital. The city is well connected with motorways in all directions. Keep in mind that Zürich (and Switzerland in general) is expensive compared to its neighbouring countries.     \\n\\n\\n== Hitchhiking out ==\\n\\n\\n=== Northwest towards [[Basel]] {{European Route Number|60}}, southwest towards [[Bern]] {{European Route Number|35}}, ===\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 1 \\'\\'\\'\\n\\nTake tram 4 to \\'\\'Sportweg\\'\\'. Cross the tram tracks to the opposite platform and walk back about 30m in the direction the tram came to the lay-by on Pfingstweidstrasse. This is a very good hitching spot located before the motorway entrance as cars are not going too fast and drivers can see you from afar and have time to pull into the lay-by. It is also a spot easily accessible from the city center.  \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 2 \\'\\'\\'\\n\\nAnother option is to reach a petrol station on the motorway by train and then foot. Take the S12 to \\'\\'Kilwangen-Spreitenbach\\'\\'. The stop is near the service station. One can also use this petrol station to go east and south of \\'\\'\\'Zürich\\'\\'\\' by using the opposite side to the Bern/Basel exit.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Option 3\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nThird option is to reach an other petrol station on the motorway by train and then foot.Take the S6 (Direction Baden) and stop at Würenlos or go to the train station Killwangen Spreitenbach (there are both at the same distance more or less). From there you will have to walk to the gas station (C8QX+F3 Würenlos, Suisse)  crossing the village and then follow a road leading the station itself (crossing nice fields and a little forest from Würenlos). There is a gate which opens in both direction that gives you access to this big gas station and you can access both sides of the motorway since the stations are connected. Easy rides towards to Lausanne/Geneve and even France.\\n\\n=== South towards [[Italy]] {{European Route Number|41}}, east towards [[Austria]] ===\\n\\nFollow signs in the city for motorway 4 to [[Luzern]]. You will reach West st. Just past the intersection of West and Werd, there is a driveway in front of an apartment building where cars can pull over just before the right turn onto the onramp of motorway 4.
