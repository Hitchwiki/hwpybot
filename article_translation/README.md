Scripts here translate Hitchwiki articles that are only present in one language wiki into another language. Usually that is from some language to English.

# Setup

Create `.env` from `example.env`

Create `user_password.py` from `user-password.py.example`

To develop your script building up on `experiment.ipynb` can be handy.

From the scripts that are ready to run `translate_turkey_openai.py` is the cleanest.
