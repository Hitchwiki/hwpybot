This is pywikibot code for hitchwiki.

Initially it will do stuff around geo and nostr, see https://github.com/Hitchwiki/hitchwiki/issues/215
Later on it might do more.


It's using Astral uv for handling packages etc.
See https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/



Run the script:

    uv run hitchwiki-geo.py
